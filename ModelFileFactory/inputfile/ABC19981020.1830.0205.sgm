Now no American influence in Kosovo.
It is a week since the U.S. and NATO pressured the Serbian leader, Slobodan
milosevic, to end the Serb violence against the ethnic Albanians there.
Today the Pentagon said we have not seen full compliance or anything close
to it.
Sheila MacVicar is in Kosovo tonight.

This is what the first American and European monitors are seeing
as they drive throughout Kosovo.
Past miles of destroyed and empty villages, Serb police checkpoints where
traffic is stopped and identity papers checked.
On hilltops, fortified Serb positions, and sometimes Serb armored vehicles
-- Dozens of tanks and heavy weapons dug in and camouflaged.
These certainly look like violations of the agreement.
The problem is, the agreement itself is so short on specifics, western
monitors cannot say what is a violation and what is not.
<TURN>
I think that this is going to have to be worked out on a case-by-case
basis.

With officials still trying to sort out just what the deal means,
the bottom line is that the ethnic Albanian refugees are supposed to feel
safe enough to go home and stay home.
But that is not happening either.
"The Serb police are just up there," this man says, "and they have a new
checkpoint down there."
And for the last several nights, the Serbs have shelled these villages.
So while people have been coming home in the morning, every night people
leave the village and go back to the mountains.

I was really disappointed to come back after the agreement was signed.
I expected to see an improvement.

The agreement has done virtually nothing to change the Serb
position, that they have the right to deploy their forces as they see fit.
