Perhaps the worst feature of Spitzer 's Attila the Hun-like sweep through the financial services industry is his habit of breeding imitators , who will essentially use his settlement as a benchmark for creating their own demands .

Interestingly enough , this morning 's Wall Street Journal reported that Marsh paid a higher fee than they needed to -- that the $ 850 million number was agreed upon at the last minute mainly so Marsh could pay out over a four-year period without admitting guilt .

The rhetoric we 're hearing -- that Marsh may have cost customers billions of dollars -- does n't match the reality that in a few cases , they manipulated bids , but that the proven damages thus far involve only a few million dollars of business priced 5 % or 10 % higher than it otherwise would have been .
