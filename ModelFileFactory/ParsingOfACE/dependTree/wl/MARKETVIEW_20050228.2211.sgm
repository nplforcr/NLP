Byrne 2005-02-28T22 :11:00 You 'd think he was busy enough with Blockbuster and Hollywood , but Carl Icahn is once again going after Mylan labs .

I 'd love to call it a classic raid -- he 's making an offer for the company , nominating his own board , claiming management can accept one or the other or both , and hinting that if they paid him enough , he 'd probably go away .

But the whole point of raiding is to outsmart an opponent , and that means the strategy changes constantly .

In this case , the most interesting twist is that he 's shorting shares of Mylan 's acquisition target , King Pharmaceuticals ; he 's basically doubling down on the bet that they wo n't acquire .

Not only that , but if Mylan bought him out , they 'd have less money to fund a purchase of King Pharmaceuticals .

Either way , he 's showing a lot of confidence .

Given his record , it 's warranted .
