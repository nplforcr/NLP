The National Carousel Association was founded in the early 1970 's by a group of art historians and collectors , including Frederick Fried , author of the 1964 book `` A Pictorial History of The Carousel '' that single-handedly gave the classic hand-carved wooden carousel the respect and appreciation it deserved .

As such , during the 1980 's many beautiful and unique wooden carousels would be broken up at the auction block , as owners rushed to cash in on the antique marketplace .

The liability insurance crisis further aggravated the situation , as amusement park operators sought to cut their losses , while at the same time liquidate underperforming carousels to raise capital for the purchase of newer and more profitable -LRB- thrill -RRB- rides .

Some collectors of carousel art and auction houses were accused of using their NCA affiliation to gain information about vintage carousels that they could target for breakup to their own personal profit , a practice certainly contrary to the stated goals of the organization .

The increasing rift between the `` preservationists '' and `` collectors '' would eventually boil over into an internal political struggle that caused many in the collectors faction of the NCA to walk out of the group , including founders such as Charlotte Dinger and others .
