Yes , but according to the facts you first gave , he had not yet received the bankruptcy discharge when you gave him the shares .

I believe you had said that you gave him the shares in February 2004 but that the discharge did n't come until June of 2004 .

That means that he received the shares while he was still in bankruptcy , which means that the shares were potentially assets that the trustee could use to pay off creditors .

A bankruptcy case does n't close until you get the discharge order , and until then everything that the debtor receives is fair game for the trustee .

If , however , your uncle received the shares after he obtained an order of discharge from the bankruptcy court , then as a general matter the creditors can not go after the shares , unless they can prove that there was collusion between you and your uncle to hide his assets from them -LRB- e.g. , by putting his assets in the corporation 's name and then waiting until after the bankruptcy to transfer the shares to him -RRB- .
