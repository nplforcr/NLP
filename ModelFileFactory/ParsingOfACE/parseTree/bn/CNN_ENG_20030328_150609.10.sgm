391 851 in a strange way and this may sound unusual , there 's a little sense of relief because these soldiers were set to leave in January and now they got second deployment orders , the delay , of course , the inability to get access to turkey , but along the way , the 4th infantry division is one seeped in tradition and there 's a real sense of pride among the soldiers , 250 of which left yesterday , over the course of the week 12,000 will be leaving from here .
