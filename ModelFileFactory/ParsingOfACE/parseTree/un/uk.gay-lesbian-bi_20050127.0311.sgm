4058 4372 Records appear to show that 50000 _ men _ were convicted of homosexuality during the Nazi rule , finding out how many were sent to a camp and killed there is more difficult especially as some who were sent to normal jails were transferred to camps at the end of their sentence , but 10-15k seems reasonable Robert .
