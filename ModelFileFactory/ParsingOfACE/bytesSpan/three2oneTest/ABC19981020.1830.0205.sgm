0 82 ABC19981020 .1830.0205 10/20/1998 18:33:25.26 Now no American influence in Kosovo .
83 232 It is a week since the U.S. and NATO pressured the Serbian leader , Slobodan milosevic , to end the Serb violence against the ethnic Albanians there .
233 314 Today the Pentagon said we have not seen full compliance or anything close to it .
315 352 Sheila MacVicar is in Kosovo tonight .
353 461 Reporter : This is what the first American and European monitors are seeing as they drive throughout Kosovo .
462 584 Past miles of destroyed and empty villages , Serb police checkpoints where traffic is stopped and identity papers checked .
585 722 On hilltops , fortified Serb positions , and sometimes Serb armored vehicles -- Dozens of tanks and heavy weapons dug in and camouflaged .
723 777 These certainly look like violations of the agreement .
778 908 The problem is , the agreement itself is so short on specifics , western monitors can not say what is a violation and what is not .
909 985 I think that this is going to have to be worked out on a case-by-case basis .
986 1175 Reporter : With officials still trying to sort out just what the deal means , the bottom line is that the ethnic Albanian refugees are supposed to feel safe enough to go home and stay home .
1176 1209 But that is not happening either .
1210 1316 `` The Serb police are just up there , '' this man says , `` and they have a new checkpoint down there . ''
1317 1389 And for the last several nights , the Serbs have shelled these villages .
1390 1511 So while people have been coming home in the morning , every night people leave the village and go back to the mountains .
1512 1582 I was really disappointed to come back after the agreement was signed .
1583 1616 I expected to see an improvement .
1617 1763 Reporter : The agreement has done virtually nothing to change the Serb position , that they have the right to deploy their forces as they see fit .
