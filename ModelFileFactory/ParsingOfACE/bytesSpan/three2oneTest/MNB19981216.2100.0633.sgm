94 125 Claire Shipman standing by now .
126 179 The subject of a lot of activity late today , Claire .
180 222 What can you tell us to update us tonight ?
223 483 One thing we 're seeing tonight with these military strikes and what we 've heard from all of the briefings we 've been listening to tonight from the president 's foreign policy advisors is there has been a change now in thinking of U.S. strategy towards Iraq .
484 581 What you have now as one official just told me , is a longer term policy of military containment .
582 809 Essentially the United States has given up on the inspections regime and the longer term as we just heard a good case made for toppling Saddam Hussein and that 's certainly something the administration would like to see happen .
810 866 They want to support the opposition to make that happen .
867 974 But in the shorter term , what we 're going to see is essentially a monitoring of Iraq with military force .
975 1113 If they get a sense two months from now that Saddam is building up his weapons of mass destruction again , I think they 'll hit him again .
1114 1349 We heard a long justification for the end of the -- the weapons inspection regime from President Clinton tonight and he also made it plain that this is not a time when Saddam Hussein should think the United States is particularly weak .
1350 1547 Saddam Hussein and the other enemies of peace may have thought that the serious debate currently before the House of Representatives would distract Americans or weaken our resolve to face him down .
1548 1704 But once more , the United States has proven that although we 're never eager to use force , when we must act in America 's vital interests , we will do so .
1705 1857 Now , there is no sense politically speaking here , Brian , that the president stands to gain or benefit from any sort of delay on the impeachment vote .
1858 1977 The advisors at this point think he 'll lose that vote whether it happen Friday or say Monday or Tuesday at this point .
