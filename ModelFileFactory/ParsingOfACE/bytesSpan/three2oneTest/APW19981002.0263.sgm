0 373 APW19981002 .0263 10/02/1998 06:16:00 BC-Rwanda-Genocide Tribunal , 2nd Ld-Writethru Ex-Rwandan mayor sentenced to life imprisonment for genocide ARUSHA , Tanzania -LRB- AP -RRB- _ A U.N. court on Friday ordered a former Rwandan mayor to serve three life sentences for convictions of genocide and crimes against humanity , plus 80 years for other violations including rape .
374 538 In the first judgment by an international court on genocide , Jean-Paul Akayesu was convicted Sept. 2 of nine counts of genocide , crimes against humanity and rape .
539 703 Akayesu had made an impassioned plea Monday for forgiveness from the Rwandan people for the genocide of more than 500,000 people , mostly minority Tutsis , in 1994 .
704 908 However , Judge Laity Kama said Friday Akayesu `` chose to participate in the genocide , '' and should therefore spend the rest of his life in prison , according to the Swiss-based Hirondelle news agency .
909 1017 `` The chamber is of the opinion ... that genocide constitutes the crime of crimes , '' Kama told the court .
1018 1125 Akayesu was ordered to serve the sentences concurrently , which means he will serve a single life sentence .
1126 1195 Akayesu stood silently , showing no emotion as the sentence was read .
1196 1346 The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda was formed in November 1994 , months after an extremist Hutu government sponsored the 90-day slaughter .
1347 1417 The genocide ended only when Tutsi-led rebels took power in July 1994 .
1418 1549 Akayesu , who was born in 1953 , was mayor of the central village of Taba where 2,000 Tutsis who sought his protection were killed .
1550 1629 He has maintained his innocence , claiming he was unable to stop the slaughter .
1630 1784 Acting in his own defense during his pre-sentencing hearing Monday , Akayesu said remorsefully , `` I regret what happened from the bottom of my heart . ''
1785 1844 He also asked for God 's forgiveness , Hirondelle reported .
1845 1991 Prosecutor Pierre Prosper called the former mayor a predator and asked for seven life sentences plus additional lesser sentences for other crimes .
1992 2104 He later said he was satisfied with Akayesu 's life sentence , the maximum penalty the U.N. tribunal can impose .
2105 2164 Akayesu has appealed his convictions , Hirondelle reported .
2165 2324 The tribunal , in Akayesu 's precedent-setting judgment , had ruled that rape and sexual violence were brutally wielded as tools of genocide in Rwanda in 1994 .
2325 2436 No one accused Akayesu personally of rape , but many witnesses said he incited the sexual abuse of Tutsi women .
2437 2475 He was sentenced to 15 years for rape .
2476 2624 During the 20-month trial , Akayesu fired his defense team three times , most recently on Monday , and has represented himself on several occasions .
2625 2669 The tribunal is holding 31 people in Arusha .
2670 2708 Another person is in custody in Texas .
2709 2757 Friday 's sentencing was the tribunal 's second .
2758 2869 Ex-Prime Minister Jean Kambanda , 42 , pleaded guilty in May and was sentenced to life imprisonment on Sept. 4 .
2870 2971 Rwandan courts have tried at least 330 people in the genocide , and 116 have been sentenced to death .
2972 3061 A total of 126,078 people are imprisoned and awaiting trial , according to the Red Cross .
3062 3186 On April 24 , the Rwandan government executed 22 genocide convicts by firing squad , the first executions for the slaughter .
3187 3277 At the Yugoslav tribunal , two men have received sentences , but neither was for genocide .
3278 3401 All those accused in the post-World War II Nuremberg trials pleaded innocent to charges including murder and extermination .
3402 3478 The trials predated the establishment of the crime of genocide 50 years ago .
