197 470 In the rehearsal hall , the dialogue was sliced tart and true from the life and times of Monica S. Lewinsky , with no less than three actresses taking a crack at the ultimate ingenue 's role in the inescapable national melodrama that has no copyright , perchance no ending .
471 824 The actors as much as the audience seemed mesmerized by the hourlong experiment at the New Dramatists playhouse , a scene of grand jury inquisition about sex and love , pride and President and all the attendant folderol that , inevitably , has raised the question of whether this stuff of life can offer something more meaningful through the theater . ''
825 1035 I 'm an insecure person , '' declared the first Monica , Culver Casson , reading the line of grand jury dialogue most sadly in explaining why she seemed so often to be there on those Presidential rope lines . ''
1036 1079 I would go early and stand in the front . ''
1080 1179 The second Monica , Emme Shaw , played it far less for pity than with a kind of savvy innocence . ''
1180 1211 Can you guys call me Monica ? ''
1212 1313 she suddenly asked the grand jury amid all the testimony about gifts and stains and embarrassment . ''
1314 1327 I 'm just 25 .
1328 1338 Please . ''
1339 1604 And the third Monica , Abigail Rose Revasch , a study in wide-eyed , free-fall anxiety , provided a confessional rush in telling of haphazardly falling in love with , well , the President of the United States : '' I thought , I thought : he had a beautiful soul . ''
1605 1646 Her spotlighted Monica was all at sea . ''
1647 1706 I do n't know what the truth is anymore , '' she keened . ''
1707 1887 I do n't know if it 's based on him being an actor , '' she said of the President , threatening the rehearsal hall , on West 44th Street in Manhattan , with a play within the play .
1888 2061 The strong applause and vigorous audience discussion that followed the reading by the band of 10 actors on Wednesday night marked the evening as something more than a stunt .
2062 2274 It seemed closer to '' a response to this public distress that we 're in , '' as Todd London , the artistic director , put it in his welcome to New Dramatists , which has been developing playwrights for 50 years .
2275 2401 The evening at least suggested that no plot line is too far-fetched , nor has the nation ever been more provoked to catharsis .
2402 2594 With her grand jury chorus compulsively curious but finally empathetic , the young woman chattily described a flirtation suddenly exploding into a huge criminal investigation of the President .
2595 2790 No less did the performance feature ludicrous moments , the audience guffawing at the true-from-life notion of the President on crutches being lewdly , hurriedly serviced by the office intern . ''
2791 2830 Oh my God , this is so embarrassing ! ''
2831 2921 said Ms. Lewinsky as a helpful grand juror gently coached , '' You can close your eyes . ''
2922 3184 Since the sound of Ms. Lewinsky has not actually been heard in public despite all the months of Washington scandal-traipsing , Mr. London rotated three Monicas through the dialogue as a sample of the possibilities , and he reduced the grand jury to five members .
3185 3434 The transition from the enacted scene to the discussion among the 75 people in the hall seemed well cued by one compassionate grand juror 's troubled line to Ms. Lewinsky : '' I ca n't figure out why you keep going after things that are n't free . ''
3435 3589 Or , as the problem was analyzed by Moira Driscoll , a grand jury actress finally speaking for herself : '' She did n't think through the thong moment . ''
3590 3750 Far more than that famously impulsive display of undergarment , Ms. Lewinsky did n't think many things through , the gathering agreed , always wondering why . ''
3751 3859 She definitely wanted to be forgiven and to be loved , '' said Kate Robin , a playwright in the audience . ''
3860 3873 And she wins !
3874 3904 The grand jurors loved her . ''
3905 3983 They offered her a bouquet at the end , '' she noted of their parting gift . ''
3984 4020 It was because she was so honest . ''
4021 4086 Instantly , another playwright , Barry Jay Kaplan , disagreed . ''
4087 4116 No , no , no , '' he said . ''
4117 4196 It 's because she has spent a lifetime learning how to do that , how to please .
4197 4225 She 's really good at it . ''
4226 4410 The now familiar Lewinsky Effect swept the audience , the inability by all sorts of well-resolved Americans not to discuss the tale even as they pronounce it too pathetic for words . ''
4411 4429 What about him ? ''
4430 4539 came one writer 's question about the President , somewhere far offstage amid Ms. Lewinsky 's predicament . ''
4540 4671 He 's not in this scene , '' another professional dismissively replied , savoring some of the good lines Ms. Lewinsky gave herself .
4672 4720 -LRB- '' Inherent in a secret is a lie . '' -RRB-
4721 4904 The evening 's director , Sabrina Peck , a specialist in verbatim dialogue drama on topics like the Bosnian refugee tragedy , admitted to doubts about the Lewinsky tale 's gravity . ''
4905 5127 We 're all disgusted on one level by the whole thing , but maybe there 's some usefulness , '' she said , finally delighted by the strong audience reaction and teased by the advice to '' make the second act Linda Tripp . ''
5128 5172 Comic relief continued to the closing lines .
5173 5306 The audience laughed at the 12-step parody in a grand juror 's avuncular advice , '' Monica , none of us in this room are perfect . ''
5307 5442 By then the third Monica of the night was weeping in farewell as she was asked if she had anything at all to add to her performance . ''
5443 5526 I 'm sorry , I 'm really sorry for everything that 's happened , '' she apologized .
5527 5599 Then , interrupting her sobs , she added , '' And I hate Linda Tripp ! ''
5600 5728 Most mercifully , the audience 's closing burst of laughter suggested the whole thing may prove more of a comedy than a tragedy .
5728 5728 .
