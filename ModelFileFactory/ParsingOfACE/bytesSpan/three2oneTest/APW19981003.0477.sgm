0 173 APW19981003 .0477 10/03/1998 12:23:00 BC-Latvia-Election , 3rd Ld-Writethru Latvians vote on laws that angered Russia , distressed the West irregularities , updated turnout .
174 431 Polls close at 1700 GMT ; early RIGA , Latvia -LRB- AP -RRB- _ Those who could vote Saturday on whether to ease citizenship laws for hundreds of thousands of stateless ethnic Russians were often confused , and those who could n't were stony with resentment .
432 634 A referendum held in conjunction with voting for the country 's 100-seat Saeima parliament asked voters if they want to reject liberalizing citizenship law amendments that the parliament passed in June .
635 882 The amendments were passed after a tense spring in which Russia threatened trade sanctions against diminutive neighbor and rained a hot barrage of denunciations , including Moscow mayor Yuri Luzhkov 's characterizing Latvia as committing genocide .
883 971 Meanwhile , the West was unhappy with Latvia , though its statements were more measured .
972 1213 The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe urged changes and many officials predicted that the European Union , which Latvia ardently wants to join , would never let the country in unless it lowered the obstacles to citizenship .
1214 1385 But after the amendments were passed , a referendum drive to overturn them began , spearheaded by nationalist politicians who claim Latvian national identity is imperiled .
1386 1564 After Latvia became independent of the Soviet Union in 1991 , citizenship was granted to ethnic Latvians and to anyone who had lived there prior to the Soviet annexation in 1940 .
1565 1713 That left out the hundreds of thousands of ethnic Russians who poured into Latvia during Soviet rule , and to their children even if born in Latvia .
1714 1802 Today , about 452,000 of the country 's 740,000 ethnic Russians are without citizenship .
1803 1890 Because they ca n't vote , they regarded Saturday 's referendum with angry resignation .
1891 1965 `` I was born in Riga , I live in Riga , but I am Russian and ca n't vote .
1966 2165 I do n't like it here , '' said a young woman who gave her name only as Alex , selling cassettes in the vast market that sprawls in and around five old dirigible hangars on the outskirts of downtown .
2166 2317 But many people who could vote were annoyed because the referendum question was phrased confusingly : a `` yes '' vote meaning `` no '' to the changes .
2318 2479 `` Frankly , I did n't understand the issue or the ballot , '' said 79-yar-old Dzetins Alois , who voted in the parliamentary election but not in the referendum .
2480 2497 He was n't alone .
2498 2711 The Central Elections Commission said that as of 4 p.m. -LRB- 1300 GMT -RRB- , about 55 percent of the 1.3 million people eligible to vote had cast ballots in the election , but about 52 percent in the referendum .
2712 2934 Some voting irregularities were reported , including President Guntis Ulmanis giving a television interview inside a polling station , and a polling place in the city of Jurmala failing to stamp about 200 ballots properly .
2935 3117 The referendum apparently slowed down voting procedures and elections commission head Arnis Cimdars said he was concerned the pace might be too slow to have voting completed on time .
3118 3351 Of the 21 parties and alliances seeking seats in the Saeima -LRB- pronounced SIGH-mah -RRB- , the right-wing Fatherland and Freedom party of Prime Minister Guntars Krasts was the only major party campaigning to turn down the changes .
3352 3414 But even that party 's support on the issue was not universal .
3415 3667 Harijs Vasilievs said he voted for Fatherland and Freedom party because he liked their economic polices , though he voted against the referendum `` I think Russian children born in Latvia should be given citizenship , '' the 61-year-old Vasilievs said .
3668 3744 `` They are not to blame for the situation they have found themselves in . ''
3745 3869 On issues other than citizenship , like the need to seek EU and NATO membership , there is wide agreement among the parties .
3870 3982 There is also broad support for the free-market reforms that have raised Latvia up from the stagnant Soviet era .
3983 4101 Voter support for one party or another appeared to depend as much on the personality of leaders as on specific issues .
4102 4312 The party that has been No. 1 in most pre-election polls with around 20 percent support is the center-right Peoples Party , a new party founded by wealthy businessman and a former prime minister , Andris Skele .
4313 4465 Skele has said Latvia relies too much on transit trade to and from Russia , and said policies should also focus on producing goods in Latvia for export .
