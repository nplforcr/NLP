0 161 PRI19981016 .2000.2649 10/16/1998 20:44:09.85 The ` 94th World Series opens tomorrow in New York with the favored Yankees taking on the upstart San Diego Padres .
162 292 But you can bet a stack of baseball trading cards that New Yorkers and San Diegoans are n't the only fans with a rooting interest .
293 424 In Tokyo , American journalist Ken Belsan says that the baseball-loving Japanese might be a little late for work during the series .
425 573 spkr : Ken_Belsan All the American finales , the World Series , the NBA finals , the Super Bowl , for sure , get covered on cable TV , usually live .
574 665 In the World Series case , it 'll be about six , seven in the morning on satellite TV here .
666 702 And most people will be watching it .
703 761 If you 're a sports fan , you 'll watch American baseball .
762 889 spkr : Cahn The Japanese fans will actually get a double dose of baseball because their own world series starts tomorrow , too .
890 980 The match-up will see the favored Sable Lions going up against the Yokohoma - based Stars .
981 1122 Ken Belsan says that while many Japanese will be pulling for the underdog-based Stars , they 're not inclined to pull for the upstart Padres .

1285 1396 And I think in this case , they 'll probably look at the Yankees as the team that 's quintessentially American .
1397 1527 Most Japanese , certainly the older generation , think of Americans and America as Cadillacs , Elvis , canned beer and big steaks .
1528 1588 And the Yankees , of course , fit into that motto , I think .
