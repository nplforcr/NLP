179 312 Asian and European points : contact Karl Horwitz in Paris for details and prices -LRB- Phone : 47 42 17 11 ; FAX : 47-42-80-44 -RRB- .
313 508 Latin American points : contact Olivia Vasquez in Los The European Space Agency labored in obscurity for many years , achieving dozens of feats in the heavens that were ignored by most Europeans .
509 587 Then , in 1983 , Europe 's first astronaut soared into space aboard a shuttle .
588 760 Suddenly , millions of television viewers across the continent were glued to their sets , watching a good-looking European explorer risk life and limb on the high frontier .
761 824 Officials at the agency 's headquarters in Paris were ecstatic .
825 1031 Eager for more , they quickly got the same religion as their counterparts in America , the National Aeronautics and Space Administration , which long ago had mastered the art of promoting space-age heroism .
1032 1273 Belatedly , the Europeans discovered that public enthusiasm for sending people into space , a venture steeped in risk and danger , drama and the right stuff , was a sure way to win political support for space exploration and its great costs .
1274 1538 `` Two years ago nobody would have dreamed of actively pursuing this kind of program , '' Jacques Collet , the head of long-term planning for the European Space Agency , said shortly after the televised coup prompted the agency to plan dozens of astronaut flights .
1539 1807 Last week the agency 's officials turned out in force at Cape Canaveral , Fla. , for another lesson in space-agency showmanship as NASA skillfully orchestrated both a high-stakes drama and a world-class nostalgia trip by sending 77-year-old John Glenn back into orbit .
1808 2030 For Glenn 's flight aboard the space shuttle Discovery , NASA succeeded in drawing to Florida an estimated 250,000 people and one of the largest contingents of journalists -LRB- 2,500 -RRB- ever to cover a space launching .
2031 2233 But even on slow days , the agency has managed to turn the Kennedy Space Center into a top tourist attraction , with tour buses and souvenir shops , its attendance somewhere behind that of Disney World .
2234 2388 NASA 's public-affairs and educational arms , with hundreds of employees coast to coast after 40 years of growth , are the envy of other federal agencies .
2389 2630 They give tours , publish magazines , set up satellite feeds for television networks , develop course material for teachers , run Internet Web sites , promote high-tech gadgetry and regularly hustle out astronauts to meet an admiring public .
2631 2819 Critics say NASA 's celebrity culture and love of the entertainment side of exploration are stifling the more challenging work of sending humans and robotic probes to study distant worlds .
2820 2968 `` This is an agency that 's living in the past , '' said Alex Roland , a former NASA historian who heads the history department at Duke University .
2969 3108 `` They 're endlessly repeating the Apollo formula _ sending up astronauts , taking pictures and then sending them out on lecture tours . ''
3109 3180 Yet the shuttle flights always have a hefty dose of legitimate science .
3181 3262 In this case , it is aging research with Glenn , and dozens of other experiments .
3263 3510 But science aside , NASA is heavy with television crews and telegenic space voyagers , and it knows exactly how to go about building a political constituency to support its hefty budget , which at $ 13.7 billion this year is down from old heights .
3511 3719 So do a growing number of space agencies around the world that are happy to follow the leader and grab onto NASA 's lavish coattails ; the shuttles alone have cost American taxpayers some $ 70 billion so far .
3720 4078 Last week at Cape Canaveral , scores of Spanish journalists and television crews , as well as the crown prince of Spain and other dignitaries , joined in the frenzy to witness the launching not only of Glenn but also of Spain 's first astronaut , Pedro Duque , 35 , an engineer from Madrid who , according to his NASA biography , enjoys swimming and cycling .
4079 4273 `` It 's neat to see everybody jump on the excitement bandwagon , '' said Joel Wells , a spokesman at the Kennedy Space Center , referring to the journalists , `` and hopefully they 'll stay . ''
4274 4458 Raising the adrenalin levels of Americans can be difficult these days because the public has become so blase , especially since the astronauts do the same old thing _ circle the Earth .
4459 4608 Still , as the Glenn extravaganza suggests , the space agency has some innovations likely to jack up the thrills and chills _ if not satisfy critics .
4609 4784 As NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin put it delicately in announcing the senator 's flight : The agency is working hard these days not only to benefit but `` inspire people . ''
4785 4825 Of course , the razzmatazz can backfire .
4826 4965 A dozen years ago , the agency wanted to inspire people by enlisting the first private citizen , Christa McAuliffe , a high school teacher .
4966 5188 Among the 2,500 guests NASA invited to the launching of the Challenger space shuttle were 112 teacher finalists from the competition , two from each state and territory , who were to fan out afterward to spread the gospel .
5189 5410 After tragedy struck , killing all seven astronauts aboard the Challenger , Glenn joined the experts saying the risks of space flight should bar civilians and celebrities until the shuttle had proven itself more reliable .
5411 5499 `` This is not a Greyhound bus going from Washington to Columbus , '' he told reporters .
5500 5533 `` This is a research vehicle . ''
5534 5559 -LRB- STORY CAN END HERE .
5560 5674 OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS -RRB- Today , convinced that the shuttles are safer , NASA is revamping its star system .
5675 5875 When the agency announced the Glenn flight in January , it also disclosed that Barbara Morgan , an elementary school teacher who trained as a backup for the Challenger flight , would get a new chance .
5876 6024 Her astronaut class is to graduate in the year 2000 , after which she will be assigned to a flight and no doubt broadcast lessons to schoolchildren .
6025 6212 Experts agree that the biggest show on the horizon is the International Space Station , an outpost bigger than a football field that teams of astronauts are to build , service and repair .
6213 6297 The first supply flight for the station 's construction is set for later this month .
6298 6430 The endeavor will be extremely dangerous for those sent into orbit , given the station 's size , complexity and all the space walks .
6431 6511 The outpost 's size alone makes it a huge target for asteroids and space debris .
6512 6630 But given the thrill factor , and NASA 's diplomatic salesmanship , the space station is already an international hit .
6631 6825 Its 16 participants are Belgium , Brazil , Canada , Denmark , France , Germany , Italy , Japan , the Netherlands , Norway , Russia , Spain , Sweden , Switzerland , Britain and the United States .
6826 7026 Most of the countries expect their astronauts to join in a nearly endless series of broadcasts and dramas from space that could start as early as next year as the first modules are assembled in orbit .
7027 7134 Some critics fear that the $ 50 billion project will cripple more worthy missions , including robotic ones .
7135 7357 Others fault it as far too timid , arguing that manned missions should push for Mars and beyond , perhaps to the Jovian moon Europa , which shows signs of harboring the solar system 's deepest ocean and perhaps alien life .
7358 7541 Dr. Bruce Murray , a scientist at the California Institute of Technology and president of the Planetary Society , a private group in Pasadena that backs space exploration , disagreed .
7542 7730 He said the station , by uniting former enemies and galvanizing worldwide interest , is a potent political and technical first step toward the exploration and colonization of other worlds .
7731 7918 NASA 's public-relations campaign , he added , should be no distraction from the serious scientific and technical aims of the shuttle and station programs , nor from legitimate yearnings .
7919 7992 `` The drama of humans going away is terribly appealing , '' Murray said .
7993 8044 `` That 's why there 's all this interest in Glenn .
8045 8070 He 's going out in space .
8071 8123 You ca n't overestimate the significance of that . ''
