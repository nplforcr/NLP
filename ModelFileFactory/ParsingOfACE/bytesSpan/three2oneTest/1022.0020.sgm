PADRES ; Brosius Gives Yankees A Most Valuable Year SAN DIEGO , Oct. 21 - Brian Cashman was still an assistant general manager with the Yankees when an official from the Oakland Athletics raised the possibility of trading Scott Brosius to New York last fall . ''
407 503 I do n't think so , '' Cashman told Billy Beane , then assistant general manager for Oakland . ''
504 539 But let me check with my people . ''
540 623 Cashman was negotiating , of course , immediately responding with lack of interest .
624 688 But Cashman had communicated his own instincts as well : No way .
689 794 He knew Brosius was coming off a bad year , and he knew Brosius would be in line to make a decent salary .
795 965 After Cashman and Bob Watson , then the Yankee general manager , checked with their scouts , others assured them that Brosius was worth having -- and the rest is history .
966 1137 Brosius hammered two home runs Tuesday night in Game 3 of the World Series and singled home the third run of the game tonight to help the Yankees wrap up their 24th title .
1138 1309 It also helped Brosius nail down the Series most valuable player award ; he finished with 8 hits in 17 times up -LRB- .471 -RRB- , including 2 homers and 6 runs batted in .
1310 1388 For the 13-game post-season , Brosius batted .383 with 6 homers and 15 r.b.i. .
1389 1515 When the game ended , a jubilant Brosius leaped several times and then joined his teammates , who jumped on top of each other .
1516 1643 Later , in a joyous clubhouse , he said , '' To come over here like this , I just feel privileged to be a part of this team . ''
1644 1726 Holding his m.v.p. trophy , he said : '' I do n't know what to do with this thing .
1727 1787 It 's bigger and heavier than anything I 've ever gotten . ''
1788 1855 Brosius batted .300 and drove in 98 runs during the regular season .
1856 2065 In the estimation of his teammate Derek Jeter , he has been the team 's m.v.p. -- a pleasant surprise to club executives , who had hoped only that Brosius would play solid defense and contribute a few hits . ''
2066 2154 We did n't know exactly what Scott Brosius was all about , '' said Manager Joe Torre . ''
2155 2241 You pick up a press guide and you see numbers , and last year he was n't that good . ''
2242 2377 An understatement : Brosius was terrible for Oakland in 1997 , a year in which '' everything that could go bad did , '' he recalled . ''
2378 2562 Everything from just at times swinging the bat horribly to other times swinging the bat pretty good and being unlucky , and just not feeling real healthy , either , '' Brosius said . ''
2563 2663 It was just one of those things that kind of snowballed , and I was never able to come out of it . ''
2664 2817 Brosius batted .203 with 11 home runs and 41 r.b.i. , with others on the team feeling as if Brosius ' quiet intensity hampered him as his slump deepened .
2818 2939 He had batted .304 in 1996 , hitting 22 home runs , but given his age of 31 , it was easy to speculate he was in decline .
2940 3106 When Beane called Cashman after the 1997 season and told him the Athletics were intent on trading Brosius before the Nov. 18 expansion draft , Cashman had his doubts .
3107 3251 But the Yankees needed a third baseman , having determined to allow the aging Wade Boggs to depart as a free agent , and to exile Charlie Hayes .
3252 3313 Cashman called Ron Brand , the Yankees ' West Coast scout . ''
3314 3462 This guy can play , '' Brand told Cashman , noting Brosius ' strong defense and the fact that he always played hard and was well liked by teammates .
3463 3641 Even if Brosius does n't hit enough to be the everyday third baseman , Brand told Cashman , he could be an exceptional utilityman , because he could play just about any position .
3642 3762 Today , Brand said : '' I heard some guys talk about how he was complaining , but I never saw that in the way he played .
3763 3804 I never saw him complaining in the paper .
3805 3833 He was always very gracious .
3834 3856 He 's a model citizen .
3857 3894 I figured he just had an off year . ''
3895 4038 The deal was arranged : The Yankees sent Kenny Rogers and $ 5 million to Oakland for Brosius , who agreed to a $ 2.5 million contract for 1998 .
4039 4204 But the Yankees wanted protection , as well , and signed Dale Sveum to a two-year contract ; they knew , too , that the minor leaguer Mike Lowell could be an option .
4205 4405 By the end of spring training , Brosius had won the third-base job and Torre was talking about how Brosius was the best he had ever seen at charging in and barehanding grounders and throwing to first .
4406 4520 He batted .263 in April , but on April 22 , e drove in five runs against Toronto 's Roger Clemens with three hits .
4521 4633 This is a guy , Cashman thought to himself , that can get big hits , and Brosius exploded in May , batting .396 .
4634 4748 Brosius can be a free agent after this season , and his agent had cursory talks with the Yankees in June and July .
4749 4909 Lowell is waiting for his chance , coming off an exceptional season with Class AAA Columbus , but re-signing Brosius appears to be a priority in the off season .
4910 5136 -LRB- He figures to be in line for a three-year deal , perhaps for something in the range of $ 4 million to $ 5 million a season , and has indicated he would take less than his market value to remain with the Yankees -RRB- . ''
5137 5255 I anticipate we 'll knock it out , '' said Cashman , who must also negotiate with free agent-to-be Bernie Williams . ''
5256 5343 Ultimately , we 'd like to keep him , though we 're protected with Lowell coming up . ''
5344 5516 INSIDE PITCH The Yankees will make BERNIE WILLIAMS a contract offer that will certainly be less than what other teams offer , and it may be that Williams chooses to return .
5517 5598 But Williams and Yankees officials seemed more resigned that he would not return .
5598 5598 .
