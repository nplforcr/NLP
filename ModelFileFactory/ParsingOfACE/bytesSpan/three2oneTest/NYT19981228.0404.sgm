0 349 NYT19981228 .0404 12/28/1998 20:13:00 REMAINING VIGILANT IN AN ONSLAUGHT OF TOXIC THREATS LOS ANGELES _ On Saturday night , the Glass House dance club in nearby Pomona was packed with 800 people enjoying the holidays when the local police , federal agents and members of a Los Angeles County hazardous materials team walked in and stopped the music .
350 429 It was almost midnight and for the next four hours no one was allowed to leave .
430 655 A few minutes earlier someone had called 911 and reported what has suddenly become a common threat across the Los Angeles area in the holiday season : The caller said the lethal bacteria anthrax had been released in the club .
656 783 But like the other half-dozen anthrax threats made this month by mail and telephone , the report at the Glass House was a hoax .
784 878 `` It just seems to be the wacko 's flavor of the month , '' said FBI spokesman Frank Scafidi .
879 924 `` It used to be you called in a bomb threat .
925 948 Everybody gets freaked .
949 977 You shut down the operation .
978 1000 The perp got his kick .
1001 1034 This is just the 1998 version . ''
1035 1221 In the last month , nearly 3,000 people were evacuated and detained for hours after anthrax threats were received at courthouses , schools , stores and , most recently , the Glass House .
1222 1315 Colorado , Kentucky and Tennessee have also been subject to anthrax threats in recent months .
1316 1493 Now , Los Angeles authorities are reassessing how they handle such calls , searching for the best balance between protecting the public and not wasting time and money on hoaxes .
1494 1624 There is talk of scaling back the response the next time someone calls in and mumbles he or she has released anthrax into the air .
1625 1718 They are quick to add that each situation will have to be evaluated and treated individually .
1719 1903 `` We 're trying to fine-tune our response , '' said Dr. Laurene Mascola , chief of the acute communicable disease control unit of the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services .
1904 1956 `` We 're trying to treat it like any other hoax . ''
1957 2149 Mascola said the authorities may stop their practice of detaining people for hours while they search a threatened building and instead send people home if there is no clear evidence of danger .
2150 2327 At the night club , the authorities took the names and telephone numbers of all the patrons and then handed out pamphlets on anthrax and the proper way to decontaminate at home .
2328 2444 `` That adds to people 's anxieties and it 's positive feedback for the people who are doing the hoax , '' she said .
2445 2531 Anthrax is not easy to spread or catch and it is not contagious from person to person .
2532 2633 If it were released there would be plenty of time to administer medical treatment to anyone infected .
2634 2803 Mascola said she and her staff have had to spend considerable time answering questions about anthrax instead of concentrating on less sensational and every day problems .
2804 2835 `` Can I sleep with my wife ? ''
2836 2873 a man asked her after being detained .
2874 2906 `` Can I give it to my horse ? ''
2907 2926 someone else asked .
2927 3056 Still , finding the right balance between shrugging off a prank caller and responding to a possible emergency is not always easy .
3057 3195 `` You ca n't afford to ignore one , '' said Robert Blitzer , who recently left the FBI after directing its section on domestic terrorism .
3196 3303 `` You must attend to each and every one of them even though you know that most will turn out to be hoaxes .
3304 3394 Because the one time you do n't , it might be wrong , and there 's no margin for error . ''
3395 3549 So far , the authorities say they believe that the Los Angeles area threats are not related and appear to be the work of a litter of individual copy cats .
3550 3755 Steve Ruda , a hazardous waste expert with the Los Angeles City Fire Department , speculated that anthrax may have been chosen for the hoaxes because talk of chemical warfare has been in the news recently .
3756 3848 The first threat came in a letter to a woman , apparently in a domestic dispute , Ruda said .
3849 4062 `` For thirty five cents , the price of a phone call , they 're tying up all this manpower , '' said a disgusted Jim Nishida , a supervisor in the Los Angeles County Fire Department 's hazardous material division .
4063 4106 `` We ca n't be doing this continuously . ''
4107 4132 -LRB- STORY CAN END HERE .
4133 4281 OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS -RRB- About 2:30 p.m. Dec. 18 , a call was received at the clerk 's office in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Woodland Hills .
4282 4398 The caller said `` there may be anthrax in our air conditioning system '' recalled Dolores Molina , a court manager .
4399 4615 The call was transferred to the U.S. Marshal 's Service , which decided to evacuate the 90 people in the building , including court staff , janitorial workers , probation department workers and members of the public .
4616 4702 They proceeded calmly to a parking lot , which was roped off with yellow caution tape .
4703 4839 No one was allowed to leave until about 10:30 p.m. , she said , while a hazardous materials team took sample of the air in the building .
4840 4974 As the team worked inside , Ms. Molina and her co-workers were given blankets , pizza and donuts and a portable toilet was brought in .
4975 5130 The week before , an old-fashioned bomb threat was phoned in and Ms. Molina said the workers viewed the anthrax incident as more of a hassle than a threat .
5131 5236 `` Some of the employees , '' she said , `` were saying they were disgusted they had to go through it . ''
5237 5398 Three days later , nearly 2,000 people were evacuated from the Superior and Municipal Court buildings in Van Nuys after someone called 911 shortly after 11 a.m. .
5399 5562 They were detained until about 4 p.m. `` You have to always treat a threat as real , '' said Mark Whaling , a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Fire Department .
5563 5638 `` Monday morning quarterbacking will eat us alive if we make a mistake . ''
