163 299 Right now let us go to the well of the House of Representatives where Representative Dennis Kasich from Ohio a Democrat is now speaking .
300 365 spkr : Dennis_Kasich and this nation with a low rent impeachment .
366 431 There is much misunderstanding about just what impeachment means .
432 460 It is not a form of censure .
461 493 Impeachment is not a punishment .
494 543 It is part of a process for removing a president .
544 605 It has been reserved for the highest crimes , not low crimes .
606 786 I submit if we are to impeach President Clinton for his offenses , we will have committed an offense more grievous because we will have nullified the votes of 97 million Americans .
787 824 Do n't take away the people 's voice .
825 861 Do n't nullify the people 's choice .
862 972 Punish the President with censure if you must , but do n't punish the American people by canceling their vote .
973 1051 Someday a generation far into the future will look at this moment and ask why .
1052 1344 They will conclude that in impeaching a president , this House chose partisanship under the rule of patriotism and sanctimonious salutations to that all hallowed and selectively perceived rule of law and that cloak of shame prepared for the President will also cover those carrying the cloak .
1345 1392 For this moment , we are troubling our America .
1393 1426 We are troubling our common bond .
1427 1467 We are troubling our American community .
1468 1504 We are troubling our American unity .
1505 1625 The sun will rise and the year 2000 will soon come and those who have troubled their house will have inherited the wind .

1816 1855 spkr : Unknown Thank you , Mr. Speaker .
1856 2122 spkr : John_Olver Mr. Speaker , this is a totally prejudged and partisan process that denies the majority of the members of this House of Representatives and the majority of Americans a vote on a bipartisan compromise , a vote of conscience to censure the President .
2123 2313 Mr. Speaker , the American people in their collective electoral wisdom that we all ... spkr : Morales You are listening to debate coming to you from the well of the House of Representatives .
2314 2386 Debate on whether or not to impeach President William Jefferson Clinton .
2387 2465 The first time an impeachment of a president would have happened in 130 years .
2466 2554 Right now we are listening to Representative John Olver , a Democrat from Massachusetts .
2555 2595 spkr : Olver no grounds for impeachment .
2596 2638 No such thing appears in the Starr Report .
2639 2900 Instead I found evidence gathered at great public cost in dollars , $ 50 million , and in destruction of privacy that Americans cherish evidence of a consensual sexual relationship of the tawdriest nature which the participants tried to hide for its tawdriness .
2901 3024 Weeks of Judiciary Committee hearings have uncovered nothing more except the partisan closed mindedness of the proceedings .
3025 3205 The Republicans obsession to impeach President Clinton on the flimsiest of constitution grounds and against the will of most Americans will cause long lasting divisions in America .
3206 3444 The Republicans know that they can not get 67 votes in the Senate to remove the President from office , so this is a purely partisan exercise in this House designed to humiliate and weaken the twice elected President of the United States .
3445 3488 Fifteen seconds more please , Mr. Chairman .
3489 3562 spkr : Unknown I am pleased to grant the gentleman 15 additional seconds .
3563 3769 spkr : Olver To my Republican colleagues , by your efforts today you show the American people once and for all that you should not be in the majority in this Congress and that I believe will be your reward .
