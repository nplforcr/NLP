99 317 When a church choir sang `` Jingle Bells , '' `` Silent Night '' and the `` Hallelujah Chorus '' of Handel 's `` Messiah '' this week on the steps of a cathedral , a crowd of several hundred listened in rapt attention .
318 374 But the appeal was based less on nostalgia than novelty .
375 492 The performance was in Havana , and it was the first of its kind in Cuba since Christmas was abolished there in 1970 .
493 622 Last year , president Fidel Castro granted a Christmas holiday as a one-time favor to Pope John Paul II before his January visit .
623 689 Last month , the government decided to make the holiday permanent .
690 760 The World 's Maria Zareyes tells us about a Cuban Christmas in Havana .
761 917 spkr : Maria_Zareyes Sunday Mass is well attended at this church in Havana , particularly as Catholics here prepared for the upcoming Christmas celebration .
918 1119 The priest at this parish , Father Jose Fernandez , says he 's pleased with the recent announcements by the Cuban government to reinstate the celebration of Christmas after three decades of suspension .
1120 1199 spkr : Father_Jose_Fernandez I think we 'll all enjoy this time of celebration .
1200 1240 It 's a victory for the people of faith .
1241 1367 We 're also happy because the Cuban people in general will be able to celebrate Christmas , Catholics and non-Catholics alike .
1368 1476 I can tell you that in the past five years , more people have been coming to Midnight Mass on Christmas Eve .
1477 1550 We hope that this year even more people will come to the church tomorrow .
1551 1698 spkr : Zareyes In the last few weeks , Father Jose Fernandez has been using his sermons to remind people of the religious meaning of Christmas Day .
1699 1852 His church , like many other churches across the island , have distributed a series of leaflets explaining the concept of Christmas in very simple terms .
1853 1970 spkr : Father_Fernandez I think by now , most Cubans know that Christmas is the time to celebrate the birth of Jesus .
1971 2087 I believe they also know that the Christmas tree is a symbol of life , just as Jesus is also life for us Christians .
2088 2192 spkr : Zareyes The celebration of Christmas in Cuba was never explicitly banned by the Cuban government .
2193 2302 But in 1970 , the authorities converted Christmas Day , December 25 , from a holiday to a normal working day .
2303 2357 Soon , Christmas was forgotten -- but not by everyone .
2358 2437 Nancy is a middle-aged Havana resident who does n't want to give her full name .
2438 2556 While shopping for ornaments for this year 's tree , she says that Christmas has always been important for her family .
2557 2606 spkr : Nancy We have always celebrated Christmas .
2607 2656 We have done it with what we 've had at the time .
2657 2693 We 've eaten what 's been available .
2694 2750 Those who wanted to maintain the tradition have done it .
2751 2890 spkr : Zareyes At this shopping center in Havana , only one store sells Christmas trees and a limited variety of ornaments and decorations .
2891 2942 A medium-sized tree can cost between $ 60 and $ 80 .
2943 3024 The smaller ones are more affordable , but the few available are all gone by now .
3025 3088 Nancy recalls the times when none of the things were available .
3089 3197 spkr : Nancy Now we have these things , but before , you could n't buy them because they were n't available .
3198 3243 As a Christmas tree , we used a dried branch .
3244 3324 We painted it and then decorated it with small boxes wrapped with colored paper .
3325 3398 We also used empty cans painted with different colors to put on the tree .
3399 3529 Now the state shops are selling these things to those who can afford them , of course , because they 're mainly priced in dollars .
3530 3588 And as you know , not many people here can afford dollars .
3589 3871 spkr : Zareyes As the Cubans prepare to celebrate Christmas , buying decorations and the traditional leg of pork to roast , the Catholic Church is taking the opportunity to spread its message that Christmas should be a religious and spiritual celebration and not a commercial feast .
