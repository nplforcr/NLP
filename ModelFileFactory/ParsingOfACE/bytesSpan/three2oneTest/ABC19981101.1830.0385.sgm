0 144 ABC19981101 .1830.0385 11/01/1998 18:36:25.06 President Clinton is not running in Tuesday 's election , but he 's a factor in nearly every race .
145 236 We asked political reporters and analysts from around the country about the races to watch .
237 290 This Clinton business has really helped both parties .
291 450 Hard core republicans and social conservatives are angry at president clinton over this , and hard core democrats and liberals are angry at congress over this .
451 499 In Illinois , Carol Moseley Braun is in trouble .
500 567 She 's had a number of ethical issues in her performance in office .
568 659 Sometimes when you become the issue in a campaign , it 's awful hard to change the subject .
660 727 One of the big stories in the northeast is voter turnout this year .
728 880 In Massachusetts , for example , the secretary of state has predicted we 're going to have the lowest turnout since world war II in terms of percentage .
881 975 The Senate race pits senator Alfonse D'Amato , republican , against congressman Chuck Schumer .
976 1090 It 's the first time D'Amato has an opponent who could beat him and that has enormous repercussion for the Senate .
1091 1222 I think the single most important race out west , anywhere in the country , most would agree , is the race for California governor .
1223 1348 You have democratic governor Gray Davis running quite far ahead in the polls against republican attorney general Dan Lungren .
1349 1484 The governor , who is elected on Tuesday , will preside over reapportionment , the once every decade redrawing of political boundaries .
1485 1636 So for that reason alone , California governor 's race is going to have a Very important and significant impact on the house well into the next decade .
1637 1760 I think the election of the bush brothers Tuesday night will probably be the most important signal coming out of the south .
1761 1807 George W. bush appears to be winning in Texas .
1808 1920 If he wins big , that 's going to be an impressive victory and put him up for the republican nomination in 2000 .
1921 2052 If his brother , Jeb bush , can win also in Florida , then republicans will come in control of the two largest states in the south .
2053 2128 And I think that would be the major political event occurring in the south .
2129 2152 11/01/1998 18:38:51.46 .
