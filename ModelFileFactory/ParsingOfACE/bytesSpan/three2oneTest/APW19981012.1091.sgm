0 380 APW19981012 .1091 10/12/1998 15:57:00 BC-Yugoslavia-Kosovo , 14th Ld-Writethru U.S. envoy briefs NATO ; Milosevic concession reported BELGRADE , Yugoslavia -LRB- AP -RRB- _ As NATO stood poised to approve airstrikes , a top U.S. envoy left marathon talks with Slobodan Milosevic on Monday to brief the alliance amid reports a breakthrough was near to avert airstrikes over Kosovo .
381 577 Richard Holbrooke 's mission to Brussels , Belgium , came with Western nations evacuating diplomats from Yugoslavia _ adding to a sense that a last-minute deal was necessary to avoid intervention .
578 799 Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev told journalists in Moscow that the Yugoslav president had agreed to allow 1,500 international observers to monitor compliance with U.N. demands to halt the Serb crackdown in Kosovo .
800 966 If true , that would represent a key last-minute concession by Milosevic that came only hours before NATO planned to authorize the attack against Milosevic 's forces .
967 1039 There was no immediate confirmation of Milosevic 's reported concession .
1040 1137 But a statement from Milosevic 's office said Holbrooke would return and hold more talks Tuesday .
1138 1339 It said Milosevic `` has concluded that undoubtedly , necessary conditions exist for a peaceful political solution to the Kosovo problem '' _ a position that Western officials previously have disputed .
1340 1544 In the Kosovo capital Pristina , a senior ethnic Albanian leader said that if Milosevic agrees to such a force , it `` could prove useful and provide a way out of the Kosovo crisis without further war . ''
1545 1799 `` If Milosevic really accepts an international monitoring force , it would create a position of equilibrium in which the two sides can then negotiate , '' said Fehmi Agani , head of the ethnic Albanian team set up to negotiate with Belgrade authorities .
1800 1988 Milosevic launched his crackdown Feb. 28 to crush the Kosovo Liberation Army , fighting for independence for the majority Albanian province , which is part of Serbia , a Yugoslav republic .
1989 2074 The confluct has killed hundreds of driven more than 270,000 people from their homes .
2075 2264 In Kosovo , the ethnic Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center said two ethnic Albanians were wounded Monday when `` newly-arrived Serb forces shot at a village '' in central Drenica region .
2265 2499 The center also reported shooting near Malisevo , 40 kilometers -LRB- 25 miles -RRB- southwest of Pristina , and army troops deployment of 40 vehicles near Podujevo , 25 kilometers -LRB- 16 miles -RRB- north of the provincial capital .
2500 2566 Serb sources claimed there were no clashes Monday in the province .
2567 2620 None of the reports could be independently confirmed .
2621 2729 Ethnic Albanians represent 90 percent of Kosovo 's 2 million people and most want independence or self-rule .
2730 2883 Holbrooke arrived in Brussels as NATO ambassadors were meeting to approve an activation order _ the last formal step before airstrikes could be launched .
2884 3156 A NATO official who spoke on condition of anonymity said an activation order would show NATO 's resolve to end the violence in Kosovo , where hundreds of people have been killed and tens of thousands uprooted since Feb. 28 crackdown against ethnic Albanian rebels started .
3157 3352 The order would transfer the command over the airplanes and military equipment necessary for an airstrike to Supreme Allied Commander Wesley K. Clark and authorize its deployment over Yugoslavia .
3353 3498 Clark could then proceed in consultation with NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana all the way to actually ordering planes and missiles launched .
3499 3732 Sergeyev said Russia , which as Yugoslavia 's ally has tried to broker a deal that would avoid NATO intervention , was prepared to provide planes for controlling Yugoslav airspace , and consider participating in the monitoring force .
3733 3881 Earlier Monday , United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan phoned Milosevic to urge him to comply with U.N. resolutions to end the Kosovo turmoil .
3882 4057 Milosevic responded that he was `` in the process of complying , or trying to come into full compliance with the Security Council resolutions , '' spokesman Fred Eckhard said .
4058 4170 Holbrooke 's mission to Brussels followed a flurry of diplomatic evacuations by Western nations from Yugoslavia .
4171 4265 That added to a sense that intervention was imminent _ barring a breakthrough in negotiations .
4266 4410 The international diplomats ' mission observing events evacuated Kosovo for neighboring Macedonia , with the Russian members the last to depart .
4411 4603 Sources at the American Embassy in Belgrade said all but 12 foreign staff were being evacuated to Budapest , and an embassy statement said personnel in `` non-emergency situations '' had left .
4604 4758 A State Department advisory urged all U.S. citizens to leave Yugoslavia , and Americans in the Serb part of neighboring Bosnia also were advised to leave .
4759 4836 The German , British , Danish and other foreign embassies closed down Monday .
4837 5053 Holbrooke , who has met with Milosevic seven times in the past eight days for a total of roughly 50 hours , described his earlier overnight meeting with Milosevic as `` intense , indeed , and at times very heated . ''
5054 5153 He said the standoff between NATO and the Yugoslav president `` can only be called an emergency . ''
5154 5339 Italy on Monday authorized the use of its military bases for any NATO raid , while the outgoing German government said it intends to allow German warplanes to participate in any attack .
5340 5501 In Paris , French Defense Minister Alain Richard said his country would provide around 40 aircraft for possible airstrikes , which could last `` several days . ''
5502 5689 The major obstacle appeared to be Holbrooke 's request that Milosevic agree to an expanded international monitoring mission to verify compliance with demands of the U.N. Security Council .
5690 5917 The Security Council demands include an immediate cease-fire , a withdrawal of special troops in the province , allowing refugees to return home and beginning talks with independence-minded ethnic Albanians on Kosovo 's future .
5918 5995 The Pentagon was making military preparations if Holbrooke 's mission failed .
5996 6115 Six U.S. B-52 bombers arrived in Britain on Sunday and a contingent of A-10 antitank planes flew from Germany to Italy .
6116 6317 The positioning of more U.S. planes within range of Yugoslavia and preparing them for attacks were clearly designed to convince Milosevic of Washington 's resolve to force compliance with U.N. demands .
