183 309 But this country may spend the first months of 1999 -- as many as six months -- with the President on trial before the Senate .
310 404 For six days a week , under the rules , the 100 senators would be in their seats on the floor .
405 451 Chief Justice William Rehnquist would preside .
452 527 Congress , the President and the Supreme Court would be seriously disabled .
528 648 That is where the right-wing Republicans who are effectively running the impeachment process in the House are taking us .
649 688 Most Americans do not want to go there .
689 743 Indeed , they assume that impeachment is a dead issue .
744 802 But the House may vote next week to impeach the President .
803 819 How can that be ?
820 948 Henry Hyde , who as chairman of the Judiciary Committee is the formal manager of the process , is widely respected in the House .
949 1015 Moreover , he has a strong feeling for our political institutions .
1016 1129 Yet he is driving toward an impeachment that would damage the Presidency and arouse public contempt for Congress .
1130 1134 Why ?
1135 1248 Some who know Henry Hyde well say that , on partisan issues , he does not like to stray from the Republican line .
1249 1314 And the line on impeachment is being set by the Republican right .
1315 1459 With Speaker-to-be Robert Livingston silent , the commanding voice is that of Tom DeLay of Texas , the majority whip , a hard-line conservative .
1460 1629 Other forceful figures are Bill McCollum of Florida and Bob Barr of Georgia , who has been demanding President Clinton 's impeachment on one ground or another for years .
1630 1690 Many conservatives have a visceral dislike for Bill Clinton .
1691 1817 They reason that , even if he was acquitted in the Senate , impeachment would mark him as not even President Nixon was marked .
1818 1966 Mr. McCollum said the other day that impeachment would satisfy those who '' believe the President should be branded and given the scarlet letter . ''
1967 2061 The right is affirmatively opposed to what many people favor : censure instead of impeachment .
2062 2188 It would rather lose on impeachment and then use the negative votes of moderate Republicans to try to purge them in primaries .
2189 2250 Republican moderates are under heavy pressure from the right .
2251 2441 When Representative Billy Tauzin of Louisiana let it be known that he might consider censure rather than impeachment , the far-right magazine Human Events denounced him as '' pro-perjury . ''
2442 2476 His office got thousands of calls .
2477 2636 The moderates are also said to have been put off by what Mr. DeLay called '' lawyerese '' in Mr. Clinton 's reply to 81 questions from the Judiciary Committee .
2637 2804 Anyone facing a prosecutor who wants to put him in prison -- as Kenneth Starr plainly does the President -- will be advised by his lawyer to say as little as possible .
2805 2869 Even so , Mr. Clinton could no doubt have been more forthcoming .
2870 2990 But what should be in the minds of the Republican moderates -- and for that matter conservative Democrats -- is history .
2991 3137 Specifically , the two notorious impeachments in our history : of Supreme Court Justice Samuel Chase in 1804 and President Andrew Johnson in 1868 .
3138 3246 Chief Justice Rehnquist published a book in 1992 on those two impeachments and trials , '' Grand Inquest . ''
3247 3286 Both , he said , were highly political .
3287 3389 President Jefferson and his supporters went for Justice Chase because they did not like his judgments .
3390 3539 President Johnson was attacked by the Radical Republicans of his day because he wanted to temper harsh policies toward the South after the Civil War .
3540 3699 If either had been convicted , Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote , '' a long shadow would have been cast '' over the independence of the courts and the Presidency .
3700 3769 But enough Jeffersonians in the Senate voted to acquit Justice Chase .
3770 3884 And President Johnson was acquitted by a single vote -- that of a Republican Senator from Kansas , Edmund G. Ross .
3885 3950 Senator Ross was ostracized and impoverished because of his vote .
3951 4122 But John F. Kennedy listed him in '' Profiles in Courage , '' saying his '' heroic '' act '' may well have preserved ... constitutional government in the United States . ''
4123 4246 The accusers of Bill Clinton have abandoned all the potentially serious charges : Whitewater , campaign finance , Filegate .
4247 4310 What remains , however ingeniously framed , is lying about sex .
4311 4429 To impeach him for that would trivialize a grave constitutional process and cast a lingering shadow on the Presidency .
4429 4429 .
