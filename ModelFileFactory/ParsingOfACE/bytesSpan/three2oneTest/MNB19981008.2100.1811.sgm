0 174 MNB19981008 .2100.1811 10/08/1998 21:30:11.48 Tonight we have with us two members of Congress who took part in today 's historic vote to hold open-ended impeachment hearings .
175 285 Representative is aia hutch I son is a republican from Arkansas and a member of the house Judiciary committee .
286 326 He 's with us tonight from Capitol Hill .
327 445 Also with us from Washington , Dennis Kucinich , a democratic feshman from Ohio whose vote came as a surprise to some .
446 557 Congressman Kucinich , your vote did come as a surprise because you 're not in any sort of tight election race .
558 630 Your district is solidly democratic so why did you vote the way you did ?
631 746 I think the whole nation gets to get above this and beyond it and the only way to do that is to have open hearings .
747 856 People want to make sure the truth is brought out , so bring the truth forward and then let 's get beyond it .
857 1045 There are so many important matters to address in this country and the world but we ca n't do it until we definitively dismiss this case , and we ca n't dismiss it without having hearings .
1046 1148 But there is a question of open-endedness and there 's no -- This hearing will end with this Congress .
1149 1398 Congress would then have to reauthorize it and I think it would be very difficult if Congress is not successful in moving things forward with dispatch , because the fact of the matter is the American people want it done with , but they want closure .
1399 1555 They do n't want a cover-up and the only way we can really do justice to the nation and to the president is to make sure that the facts are brought forward .
1556 1592 Let the accusers present their case .
1593 1642 They 've never been subject to cross-examination .
1643 1735 Give the President a chance to clear himself , and let 's get above this and then beyond it .
1736 1798 Congressman Hutchinson , do you believe that is the way to go ?
1799 1884 I believe the congressman stated it very well and I admire him for what he did today .
1885 2135 I think the fact there were 31 democrats that supported the resolution that was presented shows that this is -- there 's bipartisan support for this inquiry and even those who did not support the Hyde proposal , they supported the idea of an inquiry .
2136 2235 Minority leader Gephardt indicated there is consensus in this body that we need to have an inquiry .
2236 2365 There was some dispute as to the procedures of it , but I think we 're ready to go forward and bring a conclusion to this matter .
2366 2442 Now Mr. Hutchinson , Mr. Kucinich was only one of 31 democrats who defected .
2443 2517 That was far short of some of the estimates we heard which were up to 100 .
2518 2583 That is not exactly a resounding victory for republicans , is it ?
2584 2662 I do n't think we 're looking at it whether it 's a republican victory or not .
2663 2823 I think what 's important is the American people look behind just a vote and see there was a clear consensus on a bipartisan basis for a number of things today .
2824 2861 One , that we should have an inquiry .
2862 2903 Secondly , that this is a serious matter .
2904 2996 Thirdly , that it 's a vote of conscience , and fourthly that we want to get this over with .
2997 3034 Clearly that had broad support today .
3035 3118 Now it broke down a little bit on the fine points , but that was broadly supported .
3119 3280 The American people I think can see there 's something to build on , that we can move forward , and I hope that the bipartisanship will increase as time goes on .
3281 3333 Congressman Kucinich , let 's get back to your vote .
3334 3498 There were some who said there was exceeding pressure from the White House , even the first lady on democratic members of Congress to support the president on this .
3499 3525 What contact did you have ?
3526 3554 Did anyone try to lobby you ?
3555 3560 None .
3561 3577 None whatsoever .
3578 3608 And people ought to know that .
3609 3683 This is one member who did n't receive a single call from the White House .
3684 3748 No one asked me for my vote or asked me how I was going to vote .
3749 3973 I was able to cast a vote based on the way that I felt -- things ought to move forward and it 's not done not as an attack on the president because there are plenty of supporters of the president that voted to have hearings .
3974 4061 It was done to give this country a chance to move forward and finally get some closure .
4062 4230 If we continue the debate as to whether we should have hearings , then we 'll never get to -- an opportunity to review the facts in the Starr report in an open hearing .
4231 4335 That 's what I think we need to do , but we ca n't do it in a way that it just keeps dragging on and on .
4336 4526 The American people expect this thing to be wrapped up and if there 's enough facts to review , let the committee move forward and let 's get on with the rest of the business of the country .
4527 4695 Do you personally think that what the -- what the president is alleged to have done rises to the level of impeachable offenses , even to Washington removal from office ?
4696 4745 Well , that 's why we 're going to have hearings .
4746 4811 If you do n't have hearings , you ca n't make that determination .
4812 4912 I mean , based on what 's in the Starr report , I think they 're going to need a lot more than that .
4913 4951 Need to have the report brought forth .
4952 5005 Linda Tripp needs to be brought before the committee .
5006 5083 I mean , that 's -- I voted for hearings to make sure that the truth was out .
5084 5188 Let 's shine some light on all this and give the American people a chance to settle it once and for all .
5189 5264 But there is no closure , if you just skip over the whole idea of hearings .
5265 5296 There was going to be hearings .
5297 5352 There was no question there was going to be an inquiry .
5353 5438 I say let 's move forward with it and let 's get on with the business of the country .
5439 5601 Today your reports talk about the stock market up and down , world economy is in a mess , problems in Kosovo with people dying , freezing out there in the forest .
5602 5638 Those are problems that are serious .
5639 5709 We do n't know yet how serious the problems are before that committee .
5710 5820 But we know that we better get that committee hearing over and then address the rest of the world 's problems .
5821 5996 OK , congressman Hutchinson , if we are to in congressman Kucinich 's words , to settle this once and for all , should the president have to go up to Capitol Hill and testify ?
5997 6045 It 's the president 's conduct that 's at issue .
6046 6199 Very serious charges of obstruction of justice , witness-tampering , and there 's a dispute in the evidence , the president has denied these allegations .
6200 6308 And if he desires to come to Capitol Hill and testify , I 'm sure that opportunity would be afforded to him .
6309 6515 I do n't think we should subpoena him and I do n't believe we should request him to out of deaf reference to the president but if he wants to present his defense accident he 'll have opportunity to do that .
6516 6676 If I may respond to what he just said , I think anytime President Clinton has had a chance to bring his case forward , he 's also done so well and successfully .
6677 6866 Any time new information has been brought out , it 's generally been helpful to the White House , so I think these hearings could produce an opportunity for the White House to clear itself .
6867 6932 All right , gentlemen , I believe we will have to leave it there .
6933 7009 Thank you very much , representative Hutchinson and representative Kucinich .
