0 454 1130.0351 SECTION : Section A ; Page 4 ; Column 3 ; Foreign Desk LENGTH : 957 DATE : December 1 , 1998 HEADLINE : Mexico City Journal ; Above the Law : Bodyguards Swell a Wave of Crime MEXICO CITY , Nov. 30 - The newest danger awaiting motorists on the mean streets of Mexico City comes from revolver-waving bodyguards in speeding unmarked cars , who swerve from lane to lane to make sure no one gets close to the chauffeur-driven limousines they follow .
455 562 A bump from one such escort car almost sent Humberto Cantu and his humble Ford sedan careering into a tree .
563 681 Mr. Cantu , a radio disk jockey on his way to work , caught up to the bodyguards at the next stoplight to berate them .
682 726 One of them pointed a pistol at his nose . ''
727 772 Relax , buddy , '' the man told Mr. Cantu . ''
773 811 Ca n't you see that we 're working ? ''
812 1003 In the last two years , violent crime in the capital and other major Mexican cities has surged out of control while police forces , disabled by decades of corruption , have all but collapsed .
1004 1131 So rare is it for the capital 's regular police officers to stop a crime that they often make newspaper headlines when they do .
1132 1282 As a result , frightened citizens who need help to defend their loved ones or their property have turned to private security guards , legions of them .
1283 1452 The huge growth of private security is a new complication for Mexico 's efforts -- so far in vain -- to subdue a tidal wave of crime , especially robbery and kidnapping .
1453 1576 Most guards are armed but few are trained or licensed , and the authorities acknowledge they have little control over them .
1577 1709 Abuses against unsuspecting passers-by grow more frequent every day , as do violent crimes by crooks posing as private policemen . ''
1710 1981 We have allowed a bunch of fly-by-night security companies to arm a huge number of people , basically an entire army , '' said Victor Manuel Soto Camacho , a Mexico City councilman from the opposition Party of the Democratic Revolution who is an expert on local crime . ''
1982 2068 In many cases our citizens , instead of getting security , are getting more danger . ''
2069 2137 In affluent neighborhoods , the bodyguards seem to rule the streets .
2138 2286 They strong-arm pedestrians , charge through red lights and brandish weapons , all in the name of defending '' the boss , '' whoever that may be . ''
2287 2330 Who has not been insulted or threatened ? ''
2331 2380 Arnoldo Kraus , a newspaper columnist , wrote . ''
2381 2439 All because we deign to travel on the same street as them .
2440 2555 The aggression of those wardens of 25-year-old rich kids and their Mercedeses and BMW 's is downright degrading . ''
2556 2665 Nationwide , 200,000 Mexicans are employed as guards by some 3,000 private companies , industry figures show .
2666 2729 Only 275 companies are properly registered with the Government .
2730 2836 As many as 90,000 private guards work in Mexico City , 11,000 more than the number of uniformed policemen .
2837 3018 The tradition of private bodyguards is not new in Mexico , which even contributed its own word for them to the Spanish lexicon : '' guaruras , '' a term handed down from the Aztecs .
3019 3269 Its original meaning is not known , but the current one , according to a standard dictionary of Mexican phraseology , is unambiguous : '' A strong and overbearing individual ready to draw his weapon , who is in charge of protecting another person . ''
3270 3375 In past decades only the most powerful politicians and conspicuous tycoons had their own security guards .
3376 3489 Now practically any office building , middle-class neighborhood or prominent business executive needs protection .
3490 3694 Even Homero Aridjis , a leading intellectual who is the president of the writers ' group International PEN , travels with burly men at his back since he received telephone death threats late last year . ''
3695 3749 We live in a culture of fear , '' Mr. Aridjis said . ''
3750 3847 And we do n't really know if the men watching out for us are good or bad , honest or criminal . ''
3848 3885 The guaruras ' style is unmistakable .
3886 4026 They gather in forbidding clusters outside business conferences and power-elite restaurants during Mexico City 's late-afternoon lunch hour .
4027 4153 Their vehicles of choice are either a Chrysler Spirit or a Dodge Stratus , with hubcaps removed and four doors for quick exit .
4154 4291 A heavy black steel grate , known as a burro-bouncer , shields the front fender so the driver can ram other cars without denting his own .
4292 4318 Subtlety is not a feature .
4319 4391 The guaruras all seem to wear shiny suits , black ties and dark glasses .
4392 4503 Their belts hang heavy with beepers and cellular phones and their jackets bulge with barely concealed handguns .
4504 4569 They ride four to a car , each one peering warily out his window .
4570 4704 And Mr. Cantu , the disk jockey , is an example of what happens to the unwary driver who wanders in between them and their clients . ''
4705 4925 A professional bodyguard should be discreet , '' said Ramon Requeijo Abad , president of the Mexican branch of Nutronica , an international security company that is one of the few to fully screen and train its guards . ''
4926 4990 But in this country they love to make a show of their arrogance .
4991 5047 If there is a fight , they jump in and make it worse . ''
5048 5151 Most guards are not personal escorts but lowly watchmen , standing duty in stores and building lobbies .
5152 5263 Often they make less than $ 50 a week , so the incentive is for them to commit crimes rather than prevent them .
5264 5389 Over the last year the city police have seen a rash of break-ins that appear to be inside jobs by doormen and night watchmen .
5390 5521 Police Chief Alejandro Gertz Manero opened a campaign in Mexico City recently to impose tight supervision on the security industry .
5522 5665 He wants all guards to be registered and to pass drug , psychological and weapons-handling tests as well as undergo criminal-background checks .
5666 5798 Mr. Gertz started the crackdown after he noticed two police patrol cars escorting a private vehicle , a practice that is prohibited .
5799 5951 After stopping the patrol cars himself , he quickly discovered that they were private vehicles illegally painted with the colors of the police force . ''
5952 6029 Everyone has the right to seek protection for himself , '' Mr. Gertz said . ''
6030 6087 No one has to the right to offend or humiliate others . ''
6088 6088 .
