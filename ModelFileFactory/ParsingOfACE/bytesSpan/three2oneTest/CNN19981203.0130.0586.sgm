0 135 CNN19981203 .0130.0586 12/03/1998 1:39:46.28 The real-life case that inspired `` the fugitive '' TV series took a major turn Wednesday .
136 241 The Ohio state Supreme Court gave the son of Dr. Sam sheppard another chance to clear his father 's name .
242 264 Holly Firfer has more .
265 350 Reporter : For ten years , Sam Reese sheppard has fought to clear his father 's name .
351 447 Sam and I are thrilled that maybe before the end of the century , we will put this case to rest .
448 579 Reporter : The decision by the Ohio Supreme Court means sheppard can proceed with his wrongful imprisonment suit against the state .
580 685 It could also mean his father , Dr. Sam sheppard , will officially be found innocent of a horrible crime .
686 727 It was a very violent , passionate crime .
728 828 Reporter : Fred drenkin was the first police officer on the scene at the sheppard home back in 1954 .
829 890 He found the body of Marilyn sheppard in an upstairs bedroom .
891 931 She had been brutally beaten and killed .
932 985 Dr. sheppard claimed an intruder committed the crime .
986 1039 But the police did n't buy it and neither did a jury .
1040 1108 Dr. sheppard was convicted of murdering his wife and sent to prison .
1109 1151 I do n't know who else would have done it .
1152 1205 Reporter : But sheppard won the right to a new trial .
1206 1261 And 12 years later , another jury found him not guilty .
1262 1301 The son says , that 's not good enough .
1302 1370 It still suggests that people somehow had a good lawyer and got off .
1371 1456 Reporter : For sheppard to win this case , his father will have to be found innocent .
1457 1511 And the son could collect some $ 2 million in damages .
1512 1694 I think it 's just very sad and very pathetic that people have to either claim that I 'm some kind of loony or some kind of money grubber over my -- the bodies of my dead loved ones .
1695 1768 Reporter : New DNA evidence suggests others may have committed the crime .
1769 1812 But drenkin sees no point in another trial .
1813 1878 I just do n't understand how we keep rehashing it , rehashing it .
1879 1913 And there 's always a new suspect .
1914 1933 And it never stops .
1934 2025 Reporter : It 's been nearly 45 years and the case of Marilyn sheppard is still not closed .
