0 341 NYT19981115 .0082 11/15/1998 17:00:00 BC-CUBA-NEWS-EXPAND-NYT PUSHING HARDER FOR ACCESS TO CUBA At a time when the volume of foreign news is dwindling , networks are eliminating foreign news bureaus and newspapers are downplaying reports from overseas , a dozen news organizations are making considerable effort to open news bureaus in Cuba .
342 504 Even with some increased access in recent years , the press has been allowed , at best , irregular glimpses into the Western Hemisphere 's only communist society .
505 748 With the news Friday that the Cuban government will permit the Associated Press to station a permanent correspondent in Havana _ for the first time since the AP was expelled in 1969 _ other news organizations have some renewed hope of success .
749 910 `` We 've had reporters designated as Cuban correspondents , going down as often as we can , '' said Ann Marie Lipinski , managing editor of The Chicago Tribune .
911 963 `` It 's been an ongoing part of our foreign report .
964 1010 We 'd like to make it a permanent dateline . ''
1011 1285 In addition to The Tribune , three Florida newspapers , three national broadcast television networks and the Univision Spanish-language network , along with The Wall Street Journal , The New York Times and Cox newspapers have all sought permission to open bureaus in Havana .
1286 1514 Because of federal prohibitions against U.S. firms ' doing business with the communist regime of Fidel Castro , the news organizations have sought , and obtained , waivers from the government allowing them to open Cuban offices .
1515 1570 The hard part is getting the Cuban government to agree .
1571 1765 While it has granted temporary visas to American correspondents for individual reporting trips , the only American news organization to win permission for a permanent correspondent has been CNN .
1766 1931 Other news organizations , like The Miami Herald , have provided coverage offensive enough to the Cuban government that they are seldom granted even temporary visas .
1932 2034 During a two-year visa drought , The Herald has made do by sending correspondents in on tourist visas .
2035 2171 `` We cover Cuba without physically going there officially _ we go in surreptitiously , '' Herald Executive Editor Douglas Clifton said .
2172 2232 `` We do n't like to , but it 's one of the things we do . ''
2233 2322 He pointed out that Miami has `` a massive Cuban population hungry for news from Cuba . ''
2323 2572 That population of first - , second - and third-generation Cubans , which numbers upwards of 1 million people in Dade , Broward and Palm Beach counties on Florida 's southeast coast , is a rich source of potential readers for newspapers in the area .
2573 2703 The Herald , owned by Knight Ridder , is vying with the Tribune Co. 's Sun-Sentinel of Fort Lauderdale for readers north of Miami .
2704 2815 Both newspapers are among those that have received U.S. _ but not Cuban _ permission to open bureaus in Havana .
2816 2966 Clifton was part of a delegation of American newspaper editors who last month traveled to Cuba , met Fidel Castro and raised the issue of new bureaus .
2967 3050 `` The answer he gave suggested strongly that he had no interest , '' Clifton said .
3051 3091 `` That it did n't serve their purposes .
3092 3162 That sometimes journalists were not really what they cracked up to be .
3163 3209 Sometimes they were more spies than reporters .
3210 3283 `` So we walked away from it feeling it was a bleak outcome , '' he said .
