418 738 NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin said plans to pay Russia $ 660 million over four years for equipment and services connected with the space station were necessary to save the multinational project , and that additional money would be needed to pay other added costs , most of them caused by Russia 's financial problems .
739 1021 Goldin told a House Science Committee hearing that Russia was a valuable partner in the space station program , but that the agency shared the concerns of many members of Congress that the collapse of the Russian economy threatened that nation 's major contributions to the project .
1022 1167 `` Our reliance on Russian capabilities has to be reduced , not by eliminating their involvement but by adding layers of protection , '' he said .
1168 1468 The bailout money , $ 60 million of which is needed immediately , is necessary to insure that the Russian-built service module , the crucial third component of the modular space station , is completed and ready for launching in July 1999 , three months after an April 1999 date set earlier this year .
1469 1630 Goldin said the $ 60 million was not a gift to Russia and would buy the United States added storage space and research time on Russian components of the station .
1631 1855 Rep. James Sensenbrenner , R-Wis. , who chairs the committee , criticized the National Aeronautics and Space Administration for making Russia a partner in the project and letting the troubled nation have such a crucial role .
1856 2081 Sensenbrenner said NASA had assured Congress for years that it was taking steps to insure that Russia would not be in such a critical position in the station project that its problems would endanger completion of the station .
2082 2224 `` The White House does not want to admit that its management of our relationship with Russia is fundamentally flawed , '' Sensenbrenner said .
2225 2524 `` The president promised me in writing in 1994 that we would not be dependent on the Russians to build the international space station , '' he continued , `` And now the administration wants to stick the American taxpayer with the costs of its mistakes , just to hide the fact that it made them . ''
2525 2633 Rep. Tim Roemer , D-Ind. , a longtime critic of the space station , repeated his call to cancel the project .
2634 2830 He noted that a recent NASA audit estimated that each month 's delay in the project cost U.S. taxpayers at least $ 130 million , and predicted even more delays because of Russia 's money problems .
2831 3009 Judyth Twigg , an expert in Russian affairs at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond , Va. , told the hearing that Russia 's problems run deeper than just a lack of money .
3010 3167 Since the breakup of the Soviet Union , Russia has not been conducting meaningful research and development in space and its industrial capacity has declined .
3168 3374 White House science adviser Neal Lane said after the hearing that Russia is experiencing more financial problems than anyone anticipated when it became a partner in the space station program four years ago .
3375 3565 `` We want to work with them on the problems , '' he said , adding that the administration was examining requests from NASA for more money in future budgets to cover increased project costs .
3566 3774 Goldin said partners in the $ 40 billion space station project , including the European Space Agency , Japan and Canada , agreed last week to stay on schedule for launching the first two parts of the station .
3775 3955 Critics have questioned the wisdom of putting the first two elements of the project into orbit this year and then having to wait months for the much-delayed Russian service module .
3956 4127 Russian Space Agency officials announced Wednesday that they have started launching preparations for the first element , an unmanned maneuver and storage unit named Zarya .
4128 4239 The module , built in Russia but paid for by the United States , is to be launched Nov. 20 on a Russian rocket .
4240 4386 It is to be followed on Dec. 3 by the launching of the space shuttle Endeavour carrying the first U.S. element , a connecting module called Unity .
4387 4618 James Oberg of Houston , an expert on the Russian space program , told the hearing that too many doubts remain about the readiness of the service module and other Russian-made components to launch the first elements of the station .
4619 4779 It would be a mistake , Oberg said , to begin launching elements before re-evaluating options for the program , including one that excludes Russian involvement .
