0 87 ABC19981104 .1830.0516 11/04/1998 18:38:36.96 George W. bush has an impressive victory .
88 214 Before the night was out , some republicans were practically anointing him as their presidential candidate two years from now .
215 255 ABC 's dean Reynolds reports from Texas .
256 286 inaudible Thank you , MA ` am .
287 432 Reporter : And bush has a network of well-healed contributors who helped to bankroll a media campaign as slick as most races for the White House .
433 504 His appeal to democrats , especially Hispanics is a big political plus .
505 645 speaking Spanish Reporter : While the governor opposes abortion and favors the death penalty and school prayer , he does n't sound strident .
646 729 I do n't think he 's the favorite of the evangelical right of the republican party .
730 783 But initially , he appears to be at least acceptable .
784 816 And that 's absolutely critical .
817 873 Reporter : And being from a famous family does n't hurt .
874 890 She helps a lot .
891 905 No , I do not .
906 925 Of course , you do .
926 1094 Reporter : He clearly loves campaigning , but he has said repeatedly that he is reluctant to put his family through what he calls the Washington political meat grinder .
1095 1220 And that has led to speculation that George W. bush lacks the requisite fire in the belly to make a race for the White House .
1221 1323 Then there are the questions about the governor 's admittedly irresponsible behavior as a young adult .
1324 1383 It all started because somebody discovered I quit drinking .
1384 1437 And somebody said , well , why did you quit drinking ?
1438 1483 And I said , because I was drinking too much .
1484 1590 Reporter : This being the '90s , bush has had to assure people that he 's been faithful to his wife Laura .
1591 1686 If there was something in my closet that would disqualify me from a run , you 'd know about it .
1687 1806 Reporter : He says he will concentrate on being governor for the next few months before deciding what to do about 2000 .
1807 1903 Whatever the decision , there 's no question a lot of people will be waiting to hear what it is .
