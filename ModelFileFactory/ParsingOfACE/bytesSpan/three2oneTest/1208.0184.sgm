163 221 Probably , It Is SOME numbers rise to the level of poetry .
222 339 The 35 that 's attached to the dollar sign that 's attached to the leek and potato soup at Lespinasse is one of them .
340 492 In the same way that the Chrysler Building is more than a building , the $ 35 soup , teeming with white truffles and langoustines , is more than a soup .
493 595 It is a symbol , a beacon , a shiny new prototype in the grand factory of Manhattan restaurant dining .
596 710 With a stroke of the pen , Christian Delouvrier , the new chef at Lespinasse , has raised haute to new heights . ''
711 734 Thirty-five dollars ? ''
735 877 asked Alan Stillman , the president of the New York Restaurant Group , speaking , with an audible gasp , from Las Vegas , where he was person ?
878 901 Maybe it 's for six . ''
902 916 It 's for one .
917 1149 In crude economic terms , the soup is a lagging indicator , proof positive that the long shadow cast by the stock market crash of 1987 , a calamity that took down the $ 35 plate of pasta right along with it , is well and truly over .
1150 1179 No one has set off fireworks .
1180 1253 The price of a roast-chicken entree has barely budged in the last decade .
1254 1467 But clever restaurant owners have engineered their menus to give their customers every opportunity to rack up big bills , from the mineral water and aperitif that start the meal to the desserts that finish it off .
1468 1520 And diners do not seem to be in the mood to say no. .
1521 1624 Many New Yorkers say they 've seen the evidence on their restaurant checks for the last three years . ''
1625 1832 I 'm stunned by the $ 9 bottled water , which is just sort of slipped in there at the beginning of the meal , '' said Andrea Schwan , a public relations consultant who represents architects and designers . ''
1833 1880 It 's like , ` Will it be still or sparkling ? '
1881 2019 I feel like saying , ` Well , I 'd really like Chateau Giuliani , ' but you feel it 's part of the experience , so you just go with it . ''
2020 2154 For some , it 's the simple salad that somehow crept up , from $ 7 to $ 10 , or the side order of garlic mashed potatoes , for $ 7.50 .
2155 2418 For others , it 's the 12-ounce cup of hot and sour shrimp from Daily Soup that runs $ 7.95 -LRB- served with a wedge of bread , a piece of fruit and cookie -RRB- , or the lunch-time entree that cracks the $ 30 barrier , like the sauteed veal chops at Limoncello .
2419 2517 The examples may differ , but the song is the same : dining in the city has become very expensive .
2518 2529 Is it true ?
2530 2596 New Yorkers react to food prices the same way they react to crime .
2597 2710 No matter what the statistics say , city residents can be counted on to tell pollsters that crime is on the rise .
2711 2981 The diner who has just been mugged by a bottle of sparkling water priced like a designer fragrance -LRB- $ 5 for a half liter at the '' 21 '' Club and $ 12 a liter at Harry Cipriani -RRB- is likewise inclined to believe that restaurant prices have gone through the roof .
2982 3225 The closest thing the city has to a database on restaurant prices is the annual Zagat Survey , which , although comprehensive , must be read with a certain degree of caution , since the information comes from an army of unmonitored volunteers .
3226 3462 According to the 1999 survey , which includes data through the end of June 1998 , the price of a dinner , defined as an appetizer , an entree and a drink , has risen from $ 29.38 in mid-1994 to $ 31.68 , an increase of almost 8 percent .
3463 3595 For the 20 most expensive restaurants in the city , the price of a dinner rose from $ 63.45 to $ 68.56 , also an 8 percent increase .
3596 3709 In the last year , prices rose 3.2 percent over all , but only 0.4 percent for the 20 most expensive restaurants .
3710 3808 So , why do many diners feel as though they are spending a lot , lot more when they go out to eat ?
3809 3927 Probably because they are , even though their spending patterns are not likely to be reflected in the Zagat Survey . ''
3928 4220 A lot of my clients are telling me that their checks are up dramatically , but I ca n't remember the last time any of them have raised prices , '' said Gary Levy , a partner in Arthur D. Levy , an accounting firm whose clients include Bouley Bakery , Jean Georges , Aquavit and Mesa Grill . ''
4221 4333 The smarter operators realize that if you train your staff to sell properly , you get a higher check average . ''
4334 4412 The operators are making sure that their staff members have something to sell .
4413 4828 While holding the line on the basic roast chicken , they have added enticing options at the higher price ranges , loaded on higher-priced specials , expanded their lists of wine by the glass , pushed the bottled water hard and in general -LRB- very much like car dealers -RRB- festooned their menus with so many tempting options that the Zagat figure seems more like a theoretical construct than an achievable goal .
4829 5130 Pastry , a high-markup category , plays a much greater role than it did even a few years ago , with pastry chefs getting their own menus and star billing not only at restaurants like Le Cirque 2000 or Gramercy Tavern but also at more modest establishments like 27 Standard or Club Raleigh at the Oaks .
5131 5339 Wine by the glass , another profit center , has taken off as well , thanks in part to fancy new vacuum dioxide machines that make it possible to open an expensive bottle and preserve it for as long as a week .
5340 5647 The once-standard $ 5 glass of pedestrian California chardonnay -LRB- these days more like $ 8 -RRB- now inhabits a thickly populated list that teems with moneymaking opportunities , especially among the lesser-known brands that can take a big markup , since customers are unlikely to know the retail price .
5648 5902 At Veruka in SoHo , most customers will know that $ 9 for a glass of 1995 Rosemount Estate is not much of a value , since a bottle sells at retail for $ 10 , but will they know how to size up the $ 18 price tag on a glass of 1993 Ferrari-Carano cabernet ?
5903 5941 -LRB- It retails for about $ 23 . -RRB-
5942 6002 At every turn diners have every opportunity to spend big . ''
6003 6085 We 've gone the option route , '' said Steve Scher , an owner of Union Pacific . ''
6086 6252 We have a $ 59 prix fixe menu , which we regard as good value , but the menu also presents you with options to build a meal that results in a more expensive check . ''
6253 6370 A little foie gras here , a flight of amuse-bouche there , an excursion into the $ 110 tasting menu -- it can add up .
6371 6398 Union Pacific is not alone .
6399 6453 Fixed-price fever has gripped the city 's restaurants .
6454 6517 Diners like prix fixe because they know what the check will be .
6518 6712 Restaurants like it because it commits customers to a meal that may very well be more expensive than the one they would order a la carte , especially since it commits them to eating desserts . ''
6713 6909 Within the confines of a prix fixe menu , you can hide all sorts of extravagant items , '' said Drew Nieporent , whose Myriad Group owns Nobu , the TriBeCa Grill and other high-end restaurants . ''
6910 6989 A $ 75 menu is probably a $ 25 appetizer , a $ 35 entree and a $ 15 dessert . ''
6990 7109 Restaurant owners have been hesitant to do much more than nickel-and-dime the menu on the basic appetizers and entrees .
7110 7214 When Le Cirque 2000 opened in 1997 , its owner , Sirio Macchioni , declared a two-year freeze on prices .
7215 7264 Fear not , the rack of lamb holds steady at $ 38 .
7265 7419 Rather than raising prices at Arizona 206 , the Santo family shut the place down and installed Bolivar , a moderately priced South American restaurant . ''
7420 7582 We did not feel a renovation was enough of a rationale for higher prices , '' said Andy D'Amico , a partner in the Santo Family Group , which owns the restaurant .
7583 7746 The group is currently shopping for the kind of grand premises that will enable it to position Arizona 206 as a haute-Southwestern restaurant with prices to match .
7747 7767 This is the paradox .
7768 7860 New York , flush with Wall Street money , has a lot of loose change jangling in its pockets .
7861 8050 But restaurant owners who remember the last recession are reluctant to raise menu prices across the board , especially with increased competition from a rush of new high-priced restaurants .
8051 8328 It takes a grand opening , or the arrival of an important chef , like Mr. Delouvrier , making a major statement , to crank prices up to a heroic level -- like the $ 22 prawn cocktail at the newly opened Rage , or the $ 26 pumpkin risotto at La Fourchette , another newcomer . ''
8329 8645 When we see the prices at Lespinasse , we get an overall impression that there 's fluidity in the market , but there is a certain threshold that , if you cross it , you have to justify it , '' said John Harding , the vice president of marketing at Restaurant Associates , the group that owns Cafe Centro and Tropica .
8646 8747 The money is out there , in other words , but restaurants have to employ guile and stealth to get it .
8748 8803 Which still leaves one question about the $ 35 soup . ''
8804 8923 As an Italian , '' Mr. Macchioni said , '' I have to wonder , what are white truffles doing in a soup to begin with ? ''
8924 8924 .
