0 407 1004.0085 SECTION : Section C ; Page 2 ; Column 5 ; Business\/Financial Desk LENGTH : 825 DATE : October 5 , 1998 HEADLINE : Control of Domain Names Draws Alternative Proposal WASHINGTON , OCT. 4 - The Clinton Administration this week enters the final phase of what has been a highly contentious effort by the Government to hand administration of the Internet over to an international nonprofit corporation .
408 622 A group led by Jon Postel , a founder of the Internet , presented the Government on Friday with its proposal for creating a California-based entity called the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers . ''
623 823 This organization will be unique in the world -- a nongovernmental organization with significant responsibilities for administering what is becoming an important global resource , '' Mr. Postel wrote .
824 1061 The larger significance of the proposal is that it lays out the final privatization of the Internet by the Federal Government , which financed decades of Internet development as a communication tool for military and academic researchers .
1062 1198 The more immediate issue is forming an equitable plan for creating and distributing '' top-level domain names , '' the identifiers like .
1199 1207 com and .
1208 1271 org that identify what type of resource an Internet address is .
1272 1276 The .
1277 1345 com top-level domain , for example , signifies a commercial address .
1346 1593 Until now , domain names have been administered by the United States Government -- at first directly and in more recent years under a Government contract granting a registration monopoly to Network Solutions , a corporation based in Herndon , Va. .
1594 1887 A number of private companies have demanded that they be allowed to compete with Network Solutions in the lucrative business of registering domain names , while Europeans and Asian have complained that their interests are underrepresented in the development and administration of domain names .
1888 2201 The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers , which is newly incorporated , nominated nine interim board members to help finish writing bylaws and create a permanent 19-member board responsible for introducing competition and a recognition of international interests to the domain registration system .
2202 2310 Under the proposal , the corporation would also make decisions on how and when to add new top-level domains .
2311 2579 But the long-awaited revamping plan by Mr. Postel 's group still has a number of critics , and the Clinton Administration has not yet ironed out the details for a smooth transition of crucial property and customer records from Network Solutions to the new corporation .
2580 2822 Ira Magaziner , the adviser to President Clinton who has been overseeing the transition to private governance of the Internet , had hoped to have a plan in place by the time the Government 's contract with Network Solutions expired on Oct. 1 .
2823 2940 But a last-minute breakdown in negotiations prompted the Commerce Department to extend the old contract for one week .
2941 2978 It is now set to expire on Wednesday .
2979 3131 Another extension is likely , since the Government will take 10 days of public comments on the plan and two proposed variations before it moves forward .
3132 3363 Many critics say the Postel plan was hammered out behind closed doors , despite the Administration 's call for a process that strove for consensus among the international groups that have an interest in how the network is governed .
3364 3561 One contention about the Postel plan concerns whether the new agreement would unfairly strip Network Solutions of the lucrative business it has built as the monopoly registrar of top-level domains .
3562 3660 Company spokesmen declined comment beyond saying negotiations with the Government were continuing .
3661 3947 A larger issue about the plan , though , is whether there would be proper fiscal controls and long-term checks on the powers of the proposed new board , whose members would be largely appointed by the professional , advocacy and commercial organizations that finance the corporation . ''
3948 4228 The substantive problem with it is that it is completely obtuse to questions of separation of powers and limits and accountability , '' said Lawrence Lessig , a Harvard Law School professor who has been critical of what he sees as a secretive process for drafting the proposal . ''
4229 4403 It 's a perfect corporation if you trusted the board members , '' Mr. Lessig said , '' just like any Communist government is perfect if you trust the Communist government . ''
4404 4685 An international coalition of associations representing a range of Internet interests has filed its own bylaw proposals , which would make the corporation a membership-based organization rather than one whose board members are largely selected by the organizations that finance it .
4686 4770 In another objection , J. William Semich , president and chief financial officer of .
4771 4909 NU Domain , a registrar of second-level domain names , said that the proposed bylaws lacked the proper budget reviews and spending limits .
4910 5033 In his letter to William Daley , the Secretary of Commerce , Mr. Postel acknowledged the continuing opposition to his plan .
5034 5250 He said that while the organization had been formally incorporated , it had not yet elected a board or adopted bylaws and did not plan to do so until the completion of a Commerce Department review of the proposal . ''
5251 5458 There are many challenges left for the days and years to come , but the consensus that developed around these documents provides considerable promise that those challenges can also be overcome , '' he wrote .
5459 5621 The proposed interim board includes representatives of telecommunications , Internet and academic interests from the United States , Japan , Australia and Europe .
