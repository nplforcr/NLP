0 120 ABC19981116 .1830.0759 11/16/1998 18:42:39.56 Now our regular report on how the government sometimes misuses your money .
121 241 Historically , black colleges have received federal funding to further their mission of educating young black Americans .
242 300 So , what happens when a black college is no longer black ?
301 332 Here 's ABC 's Michelle Norris .
333 443 Reporter : This is bluefield state college , one of the nation 's 105 historically black colleges -- or is it ?
444 509 When I go to class , I 'm the only black and female in the class .
510 586 Till I came here , I did n't even know it was an historically black college .
587 650 Reporter : At bluefield it 's not just a problem of appearance .
651 765 Historically , black colleges automatically qualify for federal funds that are meant to help needy black students .
766 836 That was once the mission at bluefield state , but times have changed .
837 923 Today there are few visible signs that the school once served an all-black population .
924 1107 And yet the school continues to receive more than $ 1 million a year in federal funding earmarked for black institutions of higher learning , even though the school is now 93 % white .
1108 1173 Of the school 's 2,300 students , about 200 are African-American .
1174 1260 If you look around , there 's not a lot of blacks , there 's not a lot of black staff .
1261 1335 Reporter : In fact , only 2 of the school 's 80 faculty members are black .
1336 1365 And how do we define culture ?
1366 1412 Reporter : And both were hired just this fall .
1413 1558 One professor has sued bluefield state for collecting millions of dollars of your money , even though the school is a black college in name only .
1559 1656 Maybe legally they do , but , you know , I do n't think morally they have a Right to those funds .
1657 1722 Reporter : Even the federal government admits there is a problem .
1723 1829 There is a legitimate and serious question about whether they deserve to continue to receive that funding .
1830 1964 Reporter : But that has n't stopped the government from doling out handouts and it has n't stopped the school from accepting the cash .
1965 1998 There 's a limited pool of money .
1999 2003 yes .
2004 2104 Reporter : So if you 're getting $ 1 million , that 's $ 1 million that someone else is not getting .
2105 2152 But I 'm not making that decision on the thing .
2153 2192 I 'm just putting through the proposal .
2193 2263 As an institution , we seek out those things that we are eligible for .
2264 2363 Reporter : Whether or not the school remains eligible is a question that only Congress can resolve .
2364 2510 But until that happens , this historically black , yet predominantly white college , will continue collecting $ 1 million of your money each year .
