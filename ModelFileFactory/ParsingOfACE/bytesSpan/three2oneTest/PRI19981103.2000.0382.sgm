0 78 PRI19981103 .2000.0382 11/03/1998 20:06:22.79 It 's sounding awfully familiar .
79 309 Iraq refuses to cooperate with U.N. weapons monitors , and the west threatens to use force to end the showdown , but this time around , the major players in Baghdad , Washington , and the United Nations do seem to be more serious .
310 457 Iraq , as we will hear shortly , promised again today to continue to bar U.N. inspectors from searching for banned chemical and biological weapons .
458 748 U.S. Defense Secretary , William Cohen , has embarked on a tour of the gulf region to rally opposition to Iraq 's decision , and Chief U.N. Weapons Inspector , Richard Butler , today called the new standoff , `` the worst confrontation with Iraq since the Gulf War ended seven years ago '' .
749 779 Mr. Butler is in New York now .
780 950 Can you tell us what makes this standoff more serious than the previous ones , especially the one last February , when we appears to be on the brink of a military strike ?
951 1305 spkr : Butler This is more serious because on this occasion , Iraq has moved on from simply trying to stop our disarmament work , the work of searching out the illegal weapons it has held in the past and to some extent has today , into also preventing us to monitor the capacity and actions of Iraq to recreate - reconstitute those weapons in the future .
1306 1329 We have those two jobs .
1330 1458 One , disarmament , that 's the past , and two , monitoring , that 's the future , so this is across the board on this occasion .
1459 1507 They 're trying to shut us down in all respects .
1508 1666 spkr : Mullens No , though we did get some news from Baghdad today that some technicians , apparently , were able to carry out some kind of work this morning .
1667 1745 Is any inspection or any monitoring work of substance being carried out there .
1746 1765 spkr : Butler None .
1766 1771 None .
1772 2003 What they were able to do was to tend to some cameras , remote-sensing devices , but they are a minuscule fraction of our monitoring program which relies overwhelmingly on human visits , and in that context , we 've been shut down .
2004 2316 spkr : Mullens So then aside , Mr. Butler , from the frustration of having your own mission interrupted yet again , I wonder to what extent do you fear that Iraq is using this restriction and the earlier one , curbing inspections in August , to try to rejuvenate its , uh , it 's biological and chemical weapons .
2317 2370 spkr : Butler Well , it 's not easy to quantify that .
2371 2489 You ca n't talk about what you ca n't see , but the basic position is that the security council has made the law here .
2490 2703 It requires us to be able to give it the assurance that Iraq is not reconstituting those weapons , and I reported to the council not many hours ago that we are no longer in the position to give any such assurance .
2704 2880 Now , what Iraq is doing with that time - how much the cat is - the mouse are playing while the cat 's away would be foolish for me to speculate , but the possibility is there .
2881 2956 spkr : Mullens Let 's talk about what 's happening on the Security Council .
2957 3233 From the previous divisions within the council to the criticisms that have happened within UNSCUM itself within the team - how concerned are you that the objective of cleaning Iraq of its weapons is - is being undermined and that Iraq is exploiting what seem to be weak links .
3234 3339 spkr : Butler Well , I would n't make too much of the arguments that have taken place within the council .
3340 3427 You 've got to draw a distinction between fundamental concerns and methods of approach .
3428 3532 Now , there are various approaches towards the disarmament task that have been expressed in the council .
3533 3705 There 's a healthy discussion takes place about those , but there 's no variation or difference at all with respect to the basic need for Iraq to comply and to be disarmed .
3706 4081 And certainly , when one turns to the other part of our work , namely monitoring , there is utter unity of purpose in the council that a good effective long-term monitoring system has to be in place before we can be satisfied with transiting Iraq out of the disarmament phase into the long-term monitoring phase , so there 's no - there 's no real dispute about fundamentals .
4082 4133 spkr : Mullens Baghdad has demanded your dismissal .
4134 4158 Are you going to oblige ?
4159 4244 spkr : Butler Well , would n't - would n't life be simple if it were as easy as that ?
4245 4308 Uh , what a red herring ; what a diversion from the real facts .
4309 4420 I mean , the fact is we 're dealing with weapons , not the question of who sits on the helm of my organization .
4421 4523 Uh , it 's one of the oldest tricks in the bag - if you do n't like the message , shoot the messenger .
4524 4620 No , I wo n't be obliging because that would be to give in to what is a transparent distraction .
4621 4679 The issue is their weapons , not who runs my organization .
4680 4779 spkr : Mullens Head of the United Nations ' Special Commission for Disarming Iraq , Richard Butler .
4780 4815 Thank you very much for joining us .
4816 4840 spkr : Butler Thank you .
4841 4879 spkr : Mullens 11/03/1998 20:11:08.33 .
