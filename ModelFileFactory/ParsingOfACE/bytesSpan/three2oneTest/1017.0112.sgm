PADRES -- NOTEBOOK ; Braves Lack the Finish Of a Great Champion The Atlanta Braves are not playing in New York this weekend , which means they are not playing in the World Series for the third time in their seven-season run as a division champion and therefore will not win the World Series for the sixth time in those seven seasons .
480 847 Although the Braves , whose streak goes back to 1991 -LRB- and does not include the strike-shortened 1994 season , remain the most consistently good team of the 90 's -- the enduringly best since the 1949-64 Yankees -- something has to be missing from the mix that gets them to the post-season year after year , at least something that rears its ugly head in October .
848 1121 Conversations with officials from several other clubs elicited views that could explain the Braves ' problem this way : The Braves ' starting pitching , the best and deepest in the major leagues , dominates in the regular season because no team can match the starting five .
1122 1234 In the playoffs , however , rotation depth is less critical , and other teams usually have three solid starters .
1235 1365 With that advantage neutralized , the Braves need more help from their hitters and fielders , and they do n't get it often enough .
1366 1458 Moreover , errors and other defensive lapses have undermined the Braves ' ability to win . ''
1459 1601 One thing the Braves have that no one else has is depth in the starting rotation , '' said Dave Dombrowski , the Marlins ' general manager . ''
1602 1658 Over a 162-game season , that is very difficult to beat .
1659 1725 I do n't think you can beat them unless you match up the same way .
1726 1824 But in a short series most clubs you 're playing are going to throw three quality starters at you .
1825 1859 The fifth starter is not a factor .
1860 1909 The fourth starter may or may not be a factor . ''
1910 2030 The rest of the team , however , falls short of their pitching in championship status , another general manager said . ''
2031 2177 They 're not that good a club if you take away their starting pitching , '' said the general manager , who spoke on the condition of anonymity . ''
2178 2276 If you put their starting pitching on several National League clubs , those clubs would be better .
2277 2311 Their bullpen is ordinary at best .
2312 2345 Their defense is average at best .
2346 2440 If they do n't hit home runs , they 're going to struggle because they 're not going to score .
2441 2513 They 've done it with starting pitching and timely hitting for years . ''
2514 2688 An executive of another club suggested that the Braves spend so much money on their starting pitchers that they do n't have much left to spend on bolstering their hitting . ''
2689 2739 Maybe they have four good hitters , '' he said . ''
2740 2820 If the other team 's pitching can neutralize those hitters , they can beat them .
2821 2950 If you pitch well against them , you have a good chance of beating them because their offense and their bench are n't that great .
2951 3026 If you match up with starting pitching , you can neutralize their power . ''
3027 3138 In the league championship series , the San Diego Padres ' pitchers shut down most of the Braves ' key hitters .
3139 3234 Andres Galarraga had two hits in 21 at-bats for a .095 batting average and four runs batted in .
3235 3288 Ryan Klesko had one hit in 12 tries -LRB- .083 -RRB- .
3289 3389 Chipper Jones batted a relatively torrid .208 but drove in a single run , matching Klesko 's output .
3390 3601 Andy Ashby held the Braves to 1 run in 7 innings in the first game , Kevin Brown shut them out on 3 hits in the second and Sterling Hitchcock stymied them in two starts , allowing 1 run and 5 hits in 10 innings .
3602 3657 The Braves have also had critical defensive breakdowns .
3658 3802 They hurt the Braves in the league series against Florida last October , and a relative flood of errors killed them against San Diego this year .
3803 4024 From the double error by Andres Galarraga on one play in the first game to Danny Bautista 's muffed catch of a fly ball in the last , the Braves self-destructed in the series that sent the Padres to New York this weekend .
4025 4097 Eight errors in six games is not the formula for post-season success . ''
4098 4150 There are no perfect clubs , '' Dombrowski observed .
4151 4237 But he added , '' You tip your cap to the Braves because they 're there every year . ''
4238 4408 Gerry Hunsicker , Houston 's general manager , has experienced the post-season the past two seasons and was not ready to find fault with the Braves for their latest loss .
4409 4495 He gave credit to the Padres , who also defeated the Astros in the division series . ''
4496 4587 I think the Padres were an overlooked team coming into the playoffs , '' Hunsicker said . ''
4588 4609 They were underrated .
4610 4707 This is a team that for four and a half months was arguably the best team in the National League .
4708 4783 Suddenly , in September , they had a slide and everybody forgot about them .
4784 4835 We got Randy Johnson and the hype got carried away .
4836 4899 The impact Randy would have on our team was overexaggerated . ''
4900 5041 While everyone was expecting great things from the Astros and the Braves , Hunsicker said , people were underrating the Padres ' pitching . ''
5042 5117 They have quality starters and the best closer in baseball , '' he said . ''
5118 5247 In low-scoring games , if your pitching is going to keep you in the game , then it 's just a matter of who rises to the occasion .
5248 5289 This season it happens to be Jim Leyritz .
5290 5342 Right now , Jim Leyritz is playing like Superman . ''
5343 5491 For Lack of a No. 1 Starter In the five years of their modern resurgence , the Cleveland Indians have never had a legitimate No. 1 starting pitcher .
5492 5626 That may very well be the reason they have not won the World Series and are not playing the World Series in Cleveland this weekend . ''
5627 5723 It always helps to have that big No. 1 , '' John Hart , the Indians ' general manager , said . ''
5724 5800 We readily admit we do n't have one of those dominant Cy Young marquee guys .
5801 5851 But we usually have five or six guys who are good .
5852 5903 Maybe they 're going to pitch anywhere from 2 to 4 .
5904 5948 We 've done it without a dominant No. 1 guy .
5949 5992 Does that keep you out of the World Series ?
5993 5997 No. .
5998 6031 Does it keep you from winning it ?
6032 6049 I do n't know . ''
6050 6267 In their four successive forays into post-season play , the Indians have started Dennis Martinez , Orel Hershiser , Charles Nagy , Ken Hill , Jack McDowell , Jaret Wright , Chad Ogea , Bartolo Colon and Dwight Gooden .
6268 6381 At times some of of those pitchers were considered No. 1 's , but they were past their prime with the Indians . ''
6382 6501 As we built our club , '' Hart said , '' we built it as an American League team -- small ball parks , lack of pitching .
6502 6544 We built our club early on around offense .
6545 6718 To win and still compete economically , we thought we would sign starting pitchers that would be able to keep us in games and hope to develop front-of-the-rotation starters .
6719 6794 Along the line , we tried to sign some guys , but that did n't work out . ''
6795 6924 The Indians pursued Roger Clemens , John Smoltz and Alex Fernandez as free agents and Pedro Martinez and Randy Johnson in trades .
6925 6983 They still await the arrival of a pitcher of that caliber .
6984 7120 The system they have built , Hart said , has carried the club to four consecutive division titles and three A.L. championship series . ''
7121 7237 It 's probably not the perfect world , but you kind of have to deal with what you have to work with , '' he said . ''
7238 7343 There 's not a bottomless pit where you can go out and say we 're going to have a star at every position .
7344 7502 Thaw in the Union The strong union feeling about players who served as replacement players in spring training of 1995 during the strike is apparently thawing .
7503 7613 The melting of bitter feelings can be seen in the post-season shares voted by players on high-finishing teams .
7614 7726 For the most part , based on a survey of club votes , players have treated replacement players like anyone else .
7727 7874 The Yankees , for example , voted Shane Spencer , the home run legend , half a full share based on the time he was with the team during the season .
7875 8088 Rick Reed of the Mets automatically received a full share because he was with the team all season , but Jeff Tam , a relief pitcher , was voted a share equal to the percentage of the season he spent with the Mets .
8089 8203 Boston players voted pitcher Ron Mahay a one-quarter share , as did the Chicago Cubs with infielder Jason Hardtke .
8204 8354 Catcher Mandy Romero will get a partial share based on service time from San Diego and a $ 3,000 cash award from Boston , where he was traded June 21 .
8355 8610 Among players who were not replacements , Randy Johnson , who pitched for Houston the last two months , was voted a full share , and Jim Leyritz will receive $ 10,000 from Boston 's post-season players ' pot and about 54 percent of a share from San Diego .
8611 8796 A player automatically receives a full share if he is with a team from June 1 , but the Yankees voted Orlando Hernandez a full share even though he missed that date by a couple of days .
8797 8875 Hideo Nomo missed by four days , and the Mets voted him a three-fourths share .
8876 9043 The Mets acquired Tony Phillips , Willie Blair and Jorge Fabregas on July 31 , but the players voted Phillips a three-quarters share and the other two about one-third .
9043 9043 .
