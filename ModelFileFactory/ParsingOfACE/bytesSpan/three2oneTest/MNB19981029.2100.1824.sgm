0 112 MNB19981029 .2100.1824 10/29/1998 21:30:24.26 Frank : Proceedings about to get under way in 40 minutes from now .
113 161 We welcome Michael gerhardt joins us throughout .
162 206 Mike and I , seen joined by Jeff Greenfield .
207 266 Folks let 's talk about the bipartisan we heard talk about .
267 399 In the end if this comes down to a straight party vote , the president would n't be convicted and there would n't be bipartisanship .
400 504 In the end as we saw with Andrew Johnson there were radical republicans who saved the party by one vote .
505 551 What has to happen to get to that model again .
552 695 I think as you pointed out radical republicans broke with the party and voted to acquit President Johnson was a defining moment for that event .
696 743 That helps us understand that particular event .
744 925 But I think something dramatic , something different , new is going to have to happen here , that would probably lead to a greater sort of bipartisanship than we have seen thus far .
926 993 My own feeling is that a party line vote will be seen as just that .
994 1082 And therefore , I 'm trying to picture what happens after a certain stage in this trial .
1083 1273 For instance , after the presentation and prewitness one could imagine 6 republicans the northeast moderates we 've heard so much about saying enough already and voting to adjourn the trial .
1274 1350 The converse , the idea of democrats breaking with the president to convict .
1351 1582 You almost ca n't imagine that happening without witnesses showing up and saying something or behaving with demeanor in such a way that democrats who are disposed to vote with the president suddenly say uo something worse happened .
1583 1675 The republican move earlier to adjourn and the democratic drift to break with the president .
1676 1737 Jeanne : Michael let me ask you about expectations for today .
1738 1809 How will this be like a conventional trial , how will it be dissimilar .
1810 1826 Very dissimilar .
1827 1841 It 's helpful .
1842 1877 This is different in many respects .
1878 1986 You have the chief justice presiding over this proceeding , he does n't proceed over trial-like proceedings .
1987 2014 You have the senators mute .
2015 2055 They are acting as more man just jurors .
2056 2143 This is their proceeding , they are in control of the the direction of this proceeding .
2144 2187 They can end it or prolong it at any point .
2188 2219 That makes this very different .
2220 2343 Moreover , the house managers and the had thes lawyers will be constrained in a certain respect with what they can present .
2344 2482 They will be able to present things only to the extent the senators allow them to present those things this will have a different dynamic .
2483 2530 Frank : Michael gerhardt we 'll be back to you .
