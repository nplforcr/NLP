954 1042 Steinbrecher said he was n't sure who would coach the U.S. team for the Australia match .
1043 1088 `` We do n't know yet , '' Steinbrecher said .

1227 1379 Arena repeatedly has refused to comment on media reports and did so again Thursday , issuing a statement through the club 's media relations department .
1380 1497 `` At the current time I do not wish to make any comments concerning any speculation about my future , '' Arena said .

2736 2980 The Interamerican Cup pits the CONCACAF club champion , D.C. United , against the South American Copa Libertadores champion , Brazil 's Vasco da Gama , and a victory would be a major credibility boost for both United and the three-year-old MLS .
