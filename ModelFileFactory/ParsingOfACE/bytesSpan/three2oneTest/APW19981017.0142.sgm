251 379 His shaky health has become a national obsession and keeps him away from the Kremlin for days , and sometimes weeks , at a time .
380 534 The economy is suffering through its worst breakdown in the post-Soviet era , but he rarely raises the subject and has n't even hinted at a recovery plan .
535 690 Even if he did , a growing band of critics argues , he 's too weak physically and politically to launch any ambitious reforms before his term ends in 2000 .
691 792 Always eager to show he 's still in charge , Yeltsin has fired the entire government twice this year .
793 809 But to what end ?
810 1100 The new government , led by Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov , is a mishmash of politicians from various groups who are struggling to put together a coherent economic program Yeltsin , 67 , brushes aside worries about his health and says there is no chance he will quit before his term ends .
1101 1238 The Russian constitution makes impeachment an unlikely option , yet the clamor for Yeltsin 's resignation is louder than it 's ever been .
1239 1378 `` Every one of his public events is painful to watch , '' said Andrei Piontkovsky , a political analyst and harsh critic of the president .
1379 1401 `` He 's out of touch .
1402 1466 The state of his health and the state of mind are deplorable . ''
1467 1534 Several leading Russian newspapers have urged Yeltsin to step down .
1535 1688 They freely speculate about whether he has Alzheimer 's disease , or a return of heart problems that necessitated quintuple bypass surgery two years ago .
1689 1851 Yeltsin 's public approval rating is in the single digits , but the president 's hard-line foes have had difficulty turning this disenchantment into mass support .
1852 2022 Protests around the country on Oct. 7 drew about 1 million marchers , but the crowds were much smaller than predicted and have not resulted in any sustained labor unrest .
2023 2097 Still , the president is losing support from traditionally friendly camps .
2098 2294 `` Temporary incapacity is one thing , but if a person can not work and permanently perform his functions , he should muster the will and courage to say that , '' Moscow Mayor Luzhkov said Friday .
2295 2349 `` Everything now depends on the president himself . ''
2350 2518 Luzhkov , a likely presidential contender in 2000 , has been an ally of Yeltsin and has never before openly questioned the president 's health or his ability to govern .
2519 2603 Yeltsin normally relishes a good fight and is at his best at times of confrontation .
2604 2700 Yet he has responded to the economic crisis by keeping a profile so low it borders on reclusive .
2701 2861 He spends most days at a country residence to the west of Moscow , venturing into the Kremlin perhaps two or three times a week , and then only for a few hours .
2862 3027 Most public appearances are carefully controlled meetings in his Kremlin office , where he chitchats with government officials briefly for the benefit of the camera .
3028 3151 Last week 's trip to Central Asia was his first foreign journey in five months , and it proved a public relations disaster .
3152 3211 Yeltsin almost fell at a red carpet ceremony in Uzbekistan .
3212 3320 He canceled meetings , cut short a news conference and headed home a day early with a respiratory infection .
3321 3485 He has called off a trip to a summit in Malaysia next month , and government sources said one reason was concern about the effects of the long flight on his health .
3486 3668 If Yeltsin were to resign _ an unlikely scenario at this point _ then Primakov would take over as president temporarily and a presidential election would be held within three months .
3669 3793 The leading contenders would be Luzhkov , former security chief Alexander Lebed and Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov .
3794 3848 To some , the signs of a campaign are already visible .
3849 3959 `` It seems to me we are already in the middle of a new presidential race , '' said Piontkovsky , the analyst .
