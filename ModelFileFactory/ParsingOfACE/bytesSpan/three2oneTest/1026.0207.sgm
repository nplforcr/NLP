159 346 The number of infant homicides has increased to the point that a baby is killed practically every day in the United States , according to the largest study of the subject ever undertaken .
347 474 Though it makes few conclusions about who commits these crimes and why , the study suggests how to protect babies at high risk .
475 737 Based on analyses of birth certificates of the nearly 35 million babies born in this country from 1983 to 1991 and the death certificates of those who died before their first birthdays , the researchers determined that 2,776 of the infants were homicide victims .
738 792 Homicide was the leading cause of death due to injury .
793 975 The infant homicide rate increased to 8.9 per 100,000 births in the period from 1988 to 1991 , up from 7.2 per 100,000 births in the period from 1983 to 1987 , the researchers found .
976 1158 The study , conducted by epidemiologists at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development , is reported in the current issue of The New England Journal of Medicine . ''
1159 1376 This study is important for two reasons , '' said Dr. Lawrence S. Wissow , a child psychiatrist at Johns Hopkins University School of Hygiene and Public Health , whose editorial on the study appears in the journal . ''
1377 1437 Infant homicide is a subject we do n't know very much about .
1438 1534 And because this is such a large data set , the study brings the subject to public attention . ''
1535 1683 The two biggest risk factors , the study found , were having a teen-age mother and , in particular , being a latter-born child of a teen-age mother .
1684 1834 These latter-born infants were 10 times as likely to be killed as were infants in the lowest risk group : firstborn babies of mothers 25 and older . ''
1835 1999 One reason we 're seeing higher risk in second or later babies is the added stress of taking care of more children , '' said Dr. Mary D. Overpeck , the lead author .
2000 2163 But Dr. Wissow noted that only about 17 percent of the victims had the leading risk factors , indicating that other important risk factors were still unidentified .
2164 2331 He said some of the babies were probably killed by mothers with postpartum depression or by mothers , fathers or domestic partners with histories of domestic violence .
2332 2391 Most of the death certificates did not identify the killer .
2392 2502 But , Dr. Overpeck said , other studies have found that the killer is usually either a parent or a stepparent .
2503 2626 It is most often the mother when the infant is a week old or less , and a male caregiver when the baby is older , she said .
2627 2757 In her study , 5 percent of the babies were killed the day they were born and half were killed by the time they were 4 months old .
2758 2840 Dr. Overpeck said she did not know why the infant homicide rate was increasing . ''
2841 2949 It 's possible that households are under more stress because of more alcohol use and drugs , '' she said . ''
2950 3020 Some studies of nonfatal child abuse suggest that this is the case . ''
3021 3096 She noted that the teen-age birth rate leveled off during the study period .
3097 3372 Although there is no proven way to prevent infant homicide , Dr. Overpeck said that having nurses visit pregnant teen-agers at home regularly looked promising because it reduced the rate of nonfatal abuse , as well as the number of latter-born infants , who are at high risk .
3373 3610 Dr. Wissow said another preventive measure was for obstetricians and other health-care givers to identify more pregnant women with a history of depression or domestic violence and to help them get the treatment or protection they needed .
