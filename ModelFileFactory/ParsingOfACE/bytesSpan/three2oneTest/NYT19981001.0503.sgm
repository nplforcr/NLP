0 227 NYT19981001 .0503 10/01/1998 23:33:00 ADVERTISING : A NEW SPOT FOR CHANEL NO. 5 The marketers of Chanel No. 5 will again ask consumers to `` Share the fantasy , '' with a lavish spot that tries to make a sale with a fairy tale .
228 482 The extravagant , elaborate spot , based on `` Little Red Riding Hood , '' will run initially in the United States , to be shown on Monday on MTV _ the first time a commercial for Chanel No. 5 has appeared on that youth-oriented cable television network .
483 655 The pitch-cum-fable will be supplemented by advertising in magazines and in stores that sell Chanel No. 5 , and then be introduced in slightly different versions in Europe .
656 892 The commercial was conceived by Luc Besson , the French director of films like `` The Fifth Element '' and `` La Femme Nikita , '' with creative contributions from Jacques Helleu , artistic director at the Chanel couture house in Paris .
893 1054 It features the model Estella Warren as a grown-up Little Red in a riding hood that Karl Lagerfeld , the designer of Chanel apparel , created for the commercial .
1055 1374 The spot , which updates `` Little Red Riding Hood '' by adding splashes of sophistication and sex , marks a return to the larger-than-life , surrealistic style of advertising that was emblematic of the No. 5 fragrance from 1979 through the early 1990s , most notably in Dali-esque commercials directed by Ridley Scott .
1375 1567 `` In a tough world where there are a lot of problems , fantasy is healthy , '' said Arie Kopelman , president and chief operating officer of Chanel Inc. in New York , the U.S. unit of Chanel .
1568 1794 The commercial also exemplifies the ambitious efforts by marketers of venerable brands to keep them fresh as competition intensifies in categories like fashion that are particularly vulnerable to the whims of fickle consumers .
1795 1868 The goal is to `` keep an old brand healthy and young , '' Kopelman said .
1869 1920 `` You have to reach out and bring in new users . ''
1921 1983 One way to accomplish that is to continually remake campaigns .
1984 2218 For Chanel No. 5 , which was introduced in 1921 , Chanel has changed commercials five times in the last 19 years , presenting spiels centered on such elements as imaginary pools and gardens , Marilyn Monroe and the art of Andy Warhol .
2219 2440 `` For a brand that 's over 75 years old , it 's hard to convey modernity , '' said Laurie Palma , vice president for fragrance marketing at Chanel Inc. `` Advertising helps us keep the brand modern , not just classic . ''
2441 2671 And this time , though the commercial is imbued with many fantasy elements , there is a harder-selling orientation as evinced by the appearance of the number five every few moments along with a giant wall of glowing No. 5 bottles .
2672 2839 `` The commercial is a fairy tale for big kids , focused on Chanel No. 5 in a way we think takes everything we 've ever done creatively full circle , '' Kopelman said .
2840 3017 The spot starts with music from the film `` Edward Scissorhands '' and a shot of Ms. Warren treading a footbridge to an armored door marked with the `` 5 '' from the No. 5 logo .
3018 3064 She gains entry with an access code _ yes , 5 .
3065 3122 Taking a bottle from the wall , she proceeds to the exit .
3123 3192 The Eiffel Tower amid cinematic snow reveals the setting to be Paris .
3193 3366 `` We looked at not having a French element , '' Kopelman said , `` but it 's key to remind people that this product , the first designer fragrance , is after all French . ''
3367 3415 Suddenly a black wolf emerges , ready to pounce .
3416 3493 But beauty prevails over the beast , defusing the attack with a tender shush .
3494 3647 As Ms. Warren departs , the wolf howls and the camera pulls back to show an oversized `` 5 '' on the floor , which then becomes a bottle of Chanel No. 5 .
3648 3746 The American version of the spot ends with an announcer urging viewers to `` Share the fantasy . ''
3747 3843 The European version omit those final words and runs longer than the 30-second American version .
3844 4026 The spot will make its debut on MTV as part of the plans to reach `` a younger audience , '' Ms. Palma said , `` which at one point was 40-plus but is now 30-plus or even younger . ''
4027 4173 `` One thing we 've learned , '' she added , `` is that young people increasingly talk about escaping from reality and the stress in the world . ''
4174 4438 -LRB- STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS -RRB- Lyle Saunders , vice president for creative services at Chanel Inc. , noted the popularity of extreme sports and computer games with that demographic group as proof of their burgeoning interest in fantasy .
4439 4576 In early November , the spot will be shown on two other cable networks watched by younger consumers , VH1 and E Entertainment Television .
4577 4675 A month later , it will begin on broadcast TV stations in 38 big markets around the United States .
4676 4883 Chanel Inc. intends to spend more than $ 3.2 million to advertise Chanel No. 5 on television in the fourth quarter , Kopelman said , compared with almost $ 1.3 million in the corresponding period a year ago .
4884 4995 The magazine ads will run in titles including Elle , Harper 's Bazaar , Los Angeles , The New Yorker and Vogue .
4996 5202 The in-store advertising will take place at such chains as Bloomingdale 's , Lord Plans call for the commercial to appear in France on Oct. 16 and then expand to Germany , Italy and Spain in early December .
5203 5481 And if a red-hooded blonde , a wall of perfume bottles and a howling wolf are not sufficient to stimulate additional sales for Chanel No. 5 , there is a packaging innovation , too : For the first time , an eau de parfum spray will be sold in the brand 's classic beveled bottle .
