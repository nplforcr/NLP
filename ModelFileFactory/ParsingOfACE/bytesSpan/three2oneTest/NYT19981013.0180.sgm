155 236 But please , hold the jokes about buttoned-down merlot and pinstriped chardonnay .
237 462 As many charge customers of the venerable haberdasher already know -LRB- a brochure went out recently with the monthly bills -RRB- , the new venture is called Brooks Brothers Cellar , and it is strictly a mail-order business .
463 576 So no , you wo n't be able to drop into your nearest Brooks Brothers store for a pair of socks and an '82 Latour .
577 698 It works like this : Send Brooks Brothers Cellar $ 30 a month , plus shipping , and it will send you two bottles of wine .
699 782 Subscriptions , if that 's the appropriate word , are for three , six or 12 months .
783 839 The 180-year-old company is moving into wine cautiously .
840 1021 The program is available in only three states , New York , New Jersey and Massachusetts , but there are plans to expand it to about 20 other states that permit selling wine by mail .
1022 1198 Brooks Brothers Cellar is the latest in a series of moves by the clothier to attract a newer , younger clientele and update its image while taking advantage of its famous name .
1199 1259 The company recently licensed its name to a line of eyewear .
1260 1384 `` Brooks Brothers is a slumbering giant , '' said Barbara Barry , a Los Angeles designer hired to polish the company image .
1385 1501 As Paul Gitter , the Brooks Brothers executive overseeing the wine program , put it : `` This is a life-style brand .
1502 1568 It has immense possibilities , and we plan to exploit them all . ''
1569 1606 Wine clubs like this one are not new .
1607 1753 Windsor Vineyards , a subsidiary of Rodney Strong Vineyards in Windsor , Calif. , in Sonoma County , has sold wine by mail for more than 30 years .
1754 1821 Windsor sells only its own wines , generally priced at $ 9 to $ 20 .
1822 1891 Its specialty is personalizing the labels for weddings and birthdays .
1892 2019 Mail-order wine is billed as a bargain but rarely is , if for no other reason than that the customer must pay shipping charges .
2020 2115 Money-saving claims are difficult to back up because many of the labels are obscure or unknown .
2116 2192 Knowledgeable customers can usually do just as well or better in wine shops .
2193 2238 Wine by mail rarely attracts savvy customers .
2239 2480 While some wine-club clients prefer mail-order wine because of the convenience or because they have no good wine shops nearby , others are attracted to it because they know little about wine and prefer having someone else select it for them .
2481 2623 Brooks Brothers Cellar subscribers can order two bottles of wine a month for a minimum of three months for a total of $ 90 , or $ 15 a bottle .
2624 2735 The shipping charge , $ 6.95 a month , will be waived for the first month for the store 's charge-card holders .
2736 2867 Members can select the color of their wines _ all red , all white or a mixed order of red and white _ but not the wines themselves .
2868 2911 No need for concern , Brooks Brothers says .
2912 3007 Its brochure assures that `` these are wines to remember ; full-bodied , crisp , or classic . ''
3008 3082 How does a clothing business come to address its customers in wine jargon ?
3083 3119 It hires someone else to do the job .
3120 3207 Brooks Brothers ' of wine and wine-associated products in Canton , Mass. , near Boston .
3208 3294 attracting them to its own wine club through brochures , catalogs and telephone sales .
3295 3367 It has also run programs like the one it has set up for Brooks Brothers .
3368 3557 `` We 've done them for Century 21 and the Brookstone chain , '' said Jay Essa , the president and chief executive , referring to the real estate company and the catalog and retail concern .
3558 3578 and 12-bottle cases .
3579 3692 Prices range from as little as $ 7 a bottle to as much as $ 80 for a wide variety of domestic and imported wines .
3693 3974 The more expensive labels often bear familiar names like Joseph Phelps , the Napa Valley winery , and the Hospice de Beaune in Burgundy , but the lower-priced wines often have little-known or which it uses on domestic wines it buys at low prices in the California bulk-wine market .
3975 4142 Its customers can be excused for being confused by names like Glass Ridge , J. Krant Cellars , Lapis Lazuli Winery and Vineyards , Rose Valley and St. Carolyne Winery .
4143 4419 These places do n't exist ; they Should Brooks Brothers Cellar members be more demanding , current catalog offers fine Bordeaux like Chateau Clerc Milon and California cabernets like Joseph Phelps ' Insignia at prices up to $ 840 a case , about what they cost in retail shops .
4420 4563 Brooks Brothers is entering wine by mail at a time when the business is under broad attack from part of the wine trade and from the government .
4564 4794 Wine sales are regulated by a bewildering array of laws that vary from state to state but generally require winemakers and importers to sell only to licensed distributors , who are then required to sell only to licensed retailers .
4795 4926 Direct-mail operators are accused of bypassing this three-tiered system and also of avoiding state taxes the distributors must pay .
4927 5153 Wine distributors are solidly opposed to any form of wine by mail and , under pressure from them , many states have been system by holding retail licenses for warehouses in 14 states that are supplied by licensed distributors .
5154 5227 It collects taxes in all states where the law requires it to , Essa said .
5228 5322 `` We 're confident that we 're in compliance with the laws wherever we operate , '' he added .
5323 5420 But Brooks Brothers ' principal concern is , of course , customer response to an untried venture .
5421 5492 If it works , buttoned-down merlot may not be so far-fetched after all .
