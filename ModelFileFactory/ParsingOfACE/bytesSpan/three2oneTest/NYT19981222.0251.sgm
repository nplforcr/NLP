201 405 Non-subscribers can make individual purchase by calling At the Container Store , a Dallas-based chain that specializes in storage products and closet organizers , employees do far more than ring up sales .
406 635 They are trained to think of themselves as counselors or problem-solvers _ whether the issue is a shared closet that must house one spouse 's 34 pairs of shoes or a child 's room spilling over with an unmanageable number of toys .
636 775 `` We 've had customers come up to us and say , ` This is better than a visit to my shrink , '' ' said Garrett Boone , the chief executive .
776 986 The company , which has 19 stores around the country , considers customer service a `` core competency , '' not a frill , and trains sales clerks for 185 hours the first year ; the industry average is below 10 .
987 1130 And the company often hires its best customers , maintaining that people who are not actively looking for a job turn out to be great employees .
1131 1196 But the Container Store 's approach , alas , is a rare exception .
1197 1350 For most of America , customer service frequently remains an oxymoron , though there are signs that some stores are paying more attention to the problem .
1351 1536 Staffs have been cut in the heat of competitive battle , and sales clerks who remain are often less than stellar _ since with joblessness down , good workers have higher-paying options .
1537 1632 And while this is a year-round problem , it is especially acute in the frenzied holiday season .
1633 1750 At this time of year , hordes of shoppers confront temporary sales clerks , who may be the least well trained of all .
1751 1843 Judging from shoppers ' stories , many encounters with sales `` help '' turn decidedly sour .
1844 1962 When customers do have a good experience , it must seem like a rarity , for they often feel compelled to remark on it .
1963 2079 As gauged by a University of Michigan index , customer-service satisfaction has dropped steadily the last few years .
2080 2298 The rate of satisfaction among the 200,000 shoppers interviewed remains far below what it was in 1994 , said Claes Fornell , a professor of business administration who oversees the American Customer Satisfaction Index .
2299 2483 `` You have fewer people serving more customers , '' he said , adding that he has had his own run-ins with airlines and cable companies , `` and the result is usually worse service . ''
2484 2576 Some stores that have had cutbacks have little to offer workers in terms of training or pay .
2577 2647 Others have apparently failed to anticipate what customers might need .
2648 2916 `` I was at one store that had good service , to the point that the guy kind of hovered around me , '' said Inna Hagen , an actress and lawyer in New York City , `` but then they did n't have gift wrap , which was annoying when you 're shopping for Christmas presents .
2917 2950 They charged me $ 6 for a ribbon .
2951 3047 `` I expect good service , '' she added , `` but I think you do n't get it a lot of the time . ''
3048 3263 At the Container Store , `` We know we are just wild-eyed fanatics when it comes to human resources and training , '' said Kip Tindell , the chief operating officer , who founded the company with Boone 20 years ago .
3264 3386 `` It is the most difficult and the most joyous part of the retail business , and most people avoid it like the plague . ''
3387 3506 The company says it makes a hefty profit , too , though it is privately held and does not make such information public .
3507 3800 Service Intelligence , an Atlanta consulting firm that is hired to place spies _ or `` mystery shoppers , '' as they prefer to call them _ in stores to see how well managed everything is , has a Web site -LRB- www.serviceintelligence.com -RRB- stocked with horror stories sent in by consumers .
3801 3865 Some of the most outrageous incidents occurred in retail stores .
3866 4013 `` While visiting a department store , I was amazed at how the only sales clerk in the area was chatting on the telephone , '' a consumer reported .
4014 4080 -LRB- Neither shoppers nor stores are named on the Web site . -RRB-
4081 4162 `` I roamed around the department near the counter trying to catch her attention .
4163 4181 This did n't work .
4182 4252 Finally , I approached the counter and stood directly in front of her .
4253 4318 She refused to make eye contact and actually turned away from me .
4319 4390 At this point , I stormed out of the store , vowing never to return . ''
4391 4545 Much of the deterioration is the result of price wars , which prompted one executive after another to zero in on customer service as an expendable luxury .
4546 4768 `` It 's been a huge mistake for many of University 's Center for Retailing Studies , who is about to publish a book , `` Discovering the Soul of Service , '' which examines businesses that have effective customer service .
4769 4794 -LRB- STORY CAN END HERE .
4795 5006 OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS -RRB- Many customers said they would often be satisfied with a little basic information , such as having a sales clerk tell them fairly quickly how soon they are likely to be waited on .
5007 5064 Some stores manage to maintain their islands of civility .
5065 5230 At Saks Fifth Avenue , sales clerks have been known to write thank-you notes to shoppers after they make purchases _ even if the purchases are less than spectacular .
5231 5319 Nordstrom maintains a sterling reputation for going out of its way to satisfy customers .
5320 5349 But those are the exceptions .
5350 5523 In many cases , the nation 's low unemployment rate has propelled would-be retail workers into higher-paying jobs elsewhere , leaving few options for stores that are hiring .
5524 5654 `` The big story this year is the employment crunch , '' said Bruce Van Kleeck , vice president of the National Retail Federation .
5655 5859 `` It 's been challenging for three years , but this year is by far the worst , because this terrific economic situation the United States has been enjoying has been a double-edged sword for retailers . ''
5860 5925 That does not make shoppers any more sympathetic to sales clerks .
5926 6209 `` The great majority of them are either totally incompetent or they need complete attitude adjustment because they think they are better than the customer , '' said Anne Goldrach of New York City , whose experiences made shopping on the Internet that much more attractive this year .
6210 6299 Joy Johnson , a Brooklyn College student , has seen the issue from both sides this month .
6300 6447 As a part-time cashier at a Sears store in New York City , she received four hours of training , which she says she considered enough for that job .
6448 6506 But as a shopper , she has not always been treated kindly .
6507 6623 After buying a set of glasses for her mother at Macy 's and discovering that one was broken , she brought them back .
6624 6724 `` He gave me a hard time , '' she said of the sales clerk , who eventually agreed to exchange them .
6725 6758 `` He said maybe I had broken it .
6759 6793 But I had had it only two days . ''
6794 6875 Even so , Johnson rates her shopping experience this year `` so far , so good . ''
6876 7026 A spokeswoman for Macy 's , part of Federated Stores , said the clerk was probably trying to determine whether Johnson wanted a refund or an exchange .
7027 7318 `` We certainly do not train our associates to tell our customers that they are not being trustworthy , '' said the spokeswoman , Ronnie Taffet , adding that the main store at Herald Square has been getting `` some very positive results '' in its year-old effort to improve customer service .
7319 7520 Peter Gurney , a vice president of Service Intelligence 's research center in Seattle , blames the tight labor market for some problems but says training is essential , no matter who is brought aboard .
7521 7606 And he thinks companies are starting to realize the need for better customer service .
7607 7725 `` There 's a ground swell for bringing it back , '' he said , `` but a controversy about what people should be doing .
7726 7784 Companies can absolutely differentiate themselves with it .
7785 7847 But you can also spend millions without getting any return . ''
7848 7957 Fornell points out that replacing human workers with technology has helped manufacturing and promoted growth .
7958 8118 `` But if you take the same idea and apply it to the service sector , which is so dependent on human interaction , it is much more difficult to do , '' he said .
8119 8143 `` It 's not impossible .
8144 8209 It is a question of education and of making technology better . ''
8210 8273 Knowing the products seems to be one of the biggest challenges .
8274 8457 Kurt Barnard , who publishes Barnard 's Retail Trend Report , based in Upper Montclair , N.J. , cited an encounter he witnessed in a suburban mall between a sales clerk and a shopper .
8458 8550 `` The lady wanted to buy one watch , a digital watch , which was $ 70 or $ 80 , '' he said .
8551 8605 `` The salesperson did not know how to set that watch .
8606 8746 And the salesperson did not know the difference between that watch and another watch that was less expensive , that the customer also liked .
8747 8819 Third , the salesperson did n't know how to light the dial on the watch .
8820 8896 The customer got a little frustrated and said , ` Can anyone help me here ? '
8897 8991 The sales clerk said , ` Let me call my supervisor , ' and then disappeared , never to return .
8992 9036 Generally speaking , this is not unusual . ''
9037 9159 But companies that have decided to make sure employees understand what they are selling say it is a worthwhile investment .
9160 9339 At Peet 's Coffee , a chain based in Berkeley , Calif. , employees are taught the subtle differences between various types of coffee and tea so they can explain them to customers .
9340 9451 `` We teach them so that they can discuss this intelligently , '' said Gerald Baldwin , the company 's founder .
9452 9513 `` And our store volumes are much higher than anyone else 's .
9514 9571 We like to think it 's the way we treat the customers . ''
