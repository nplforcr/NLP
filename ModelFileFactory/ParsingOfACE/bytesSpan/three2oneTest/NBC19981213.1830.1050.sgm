594 646 that 's what you 're doing is killing the base here .
647 833 Reporter : here is old pasadena , a 20-block-long haven for shoppers -- everything from national chain retailers to restaurants to movie theaters , and store owners like sharon arthofer .
834 927 she says her pretzel business is off 20 % on those sundays when the religious group shows up .

1108 1210 Reporter : city officials say they are sympathetic , but that the preachers are n't breaking any laws .
1211 1421 we 've have had meetings and discussed what they 're doing , but as far as we were concerned , from a prosecution , law enforcement standpoint , what they were doing was well within their constitutional rights .

2781 2841 to tell you the truth , it really has nothing to do with us .
2842 2903 it has to do with what we 're teaching and what we represent .
