0 443 1207.0405 SECTION : Section A ; Page 1 ; Column 4 ; National Desk LENGTH : 880 DATE : December 8 , 1998 HEADLINE : Reno Rejects Outside Inquiry On Clinton for Campaign Ads WASHINGTON , Dec. 7 - Attorney General Janet Reno announced today that she had no reasonable grounds to seek the appointment of an independent counsel to investigate President Clinton 's role in a multimillion-dollar Democratic advertising campaign for the 1996 election .
444 547 Her decision swept away a lingering campaign finance issue that had haunted the White House for months .
548 861 On the final day of a 90-day review period provided under the independent counsel law , Ms. Reno concluded that no further criminal investigation of Mr. Clinton was warranted because there was '' clear and convincing evidence that the President and Vice President lacked the criminal intent to violate the law . ''
862 999 The conclusion was based on Ms. Reno 's finding that their decisions had been guided by legal advice that the advertisements were lawful .
1000 1042 Excerpts from her court filing , page A24 .
1043 1136 Ms. Reno did not reach any judgment on the legality of the advertisements ' financing itself .
1137 1328 But she said the laws that regulated them were ambiguous , noting that members of the Federal Election Commission just last week described the standards as '' fuzzy '' and '' hardly clear . ''
1329 1522 The commission is expected to consider at meetings later this week whether 1996 advertising campaigns of both the Democratic and Republican Parties amounted to civil violations of election law .
1523 1721 The $ 46 million television campaign at issue in Ms. Reno 's decision today was financed by the Democratic National Committee and , under the law , was permitted to convey only broad party messages .
1722 1883 Instead , Federal election auditors have found , it communicated specific electioneering messages that directly benefited the Clinton-Gore re-election candidacy .
1884 2148 It was as a result of that finding , three months ago , that Ms. Reno set out to determine whether an independent prosecutor should investigate Mr. Clinton or his aides on the ground that they might have knowingly evaded the law in directing the advertising drive .
2149 2458 During the course of the subsequent inquiry , in which Mr. Clinton himself was interviewed by the Justice Department , the President 's lawyers argued that his reliance on legal advice insulated him from a charge of wrongdoing , since , they said , it showed that he had had no intention of violating the law .
2459 2572 Today , in her filing with the special Federal court that oversees independent-counsel matters , Ms. Reno agreed .
2573 2825 The Attorney General acknowledged in that filing that Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore had been intimately involved in the advertising campaign , raising money , formulating the advertising strategy , and reviewing and commenting on specific campaign messages .
2826 3010 But she found that their lawyers had also been deeply involved , so much so that '' media consultants periodically complained about the constraints the lawyers were placing on them . ''
3011 3108 At the White House , officials expressed their pleasure with the Attorney General 's judgment . ''
3109 3287 As we 've said all along , the President and the Clinton-Gore campaign complied with the spirit and letter of the law , '' said Joe Lockhart , the White House press secretary . ''
3288 3324 We are gratified by the decision . ''
3325 3650 At the same time , Ms. Reno disappointed Republicans , who had hoped that the '' issue ad '' investigation might finally force her to seek an independent prosecutor into campaign finance , an appointment they had sought for nearly two years through the course of inquiries into several aspects of fund-raising irregularities .
3651 3898 Of all those inquiries , this one was surely among the most significant , because an independent counsel would have focused directly on Mr. Clinton 's activities and cut to the core of the Democrats ' fund-raising operations for the 1996 election .
3899 4063 As they had before , Republicans complained today that Ms. Reno had compartmentalized the campaign finance investigations , effectively diluting any accusations . ''
4064 4346 Janet Reno has sliced this broad scandal into narrower issues so that common threads , patterns and facts are not considered when weighing each decision whether to seek an independent counsel , '' said Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah , the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee .
4347 4532 Senator Fred Thompson of Tennessee , chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee , which held extensive campaign finance hearings last year , found the outcome predictable . ''
4533 4636 Everyone knew this was coming , and it 's another banner day for the lawyers , '' Mr. Thompson said . ''
4637 4793 Lawyers advised the President that what he was doing was O.K. Lawyers at the Justice Department advised Reno that the independent counsel law did n't apply .
4794 5004 She relied on every lawyer around except the ones responsible for the investigation -- F.B.I. Director Louis J. Freeh and the head of the Justice Department 's campaign finance task force , Charles La Bella . ''
5005 5175 Mr. Thompson was referring to confidential memorandums by Mr. Freeh and Mr. La Bella urging Ms. Reno to seek appointment of an independent prosecutor on campaign finance .
5176 5354 Her move today followed by two weeks a decision by Ms. Reno in which she cleared away what might have been a serious obstacle on Vice President Al Gore 's path to the Presidency .
5355 5584 In that decision , Ms. Reno found on Nov. 24 that there was insufficient evidence for an outside prosecutor to look at whether Mr. Gore had lied to Justice Department investigators about his 1996 White House fund-raising efforts .
5585 5941 Taken together , these two decisions , plus one yet to come in a case involving Harold M. Ickes , former deputy White House chief of staff , amounted to what campaign finance lawyers said was probably the last chance for Ms. Reno to allow an outside prosecutor to examine the actions of senior White House officials in financing Mr. Clinton 's re-election .
