   October's Last Weekend     Scott   2004-11-01T11:44:00  Again I apologize for the lack of updates over the past few days and will use this space to recap a weekend that was both good and bad.  The Good:  On Friday a small group of friends and I attended a most-righteous Sister Hazel concert at Floyd's Music Store for the third straight, and for the third straight year I was blown away by one of my favorite live bands. Sister Hazel has a way of becoming intimate with the fans by brining them into the show. It's something you can always expect from these guys, unlike so many other performers, and is why I never miss a show when they're in town.  On Saturday we hosted what was for the most part a largely successful Halloween party -- save for the fake blood stains on the carpet and bathroom walls, a couple beer spills, unnecessary fights and the expected trashing of the kitchen and living room areas. Naturally, I dressed up as Hugh Hefner and took the role of making sure everyone was having a good time. I have yet to hear any complaints from any of the guests.  The Bad:  On Saturday the Seminoles were bested by unranked Maryland; effectively ending our chances at a national title this year. In addition, the quarterback controversy has once again debouched as Chris Rix almost took us to victory with his deep threat. Alas, too little too late was the case thanks to the inept Wyatt Sexton who has been our starter since replacing Rix earlier in the season. Fortunately the agony of defeat was blanketed somewhat by our Halloween party and I won't have to worry about Seminole Football until next Saturday.  On Sunday we saw "Saw" (review coming) and as expected I was less than satisfied. It was neither better nor worse than last week's "The Grudge" but the trailers beforehand dictate that the end of this year and the beginning of 2005 will bring us a large quantity of horror movies. If I enjoy one out of five considering the genre I can say it's worth it.    .

   They Refuse to Reason     Scott   2004-11-01T18:06:00  I wish I could have been at a Pub, or wherever these people convene, to see the reactions from all the Britons who read the Telegraph this morning (emphasis added): Britain's gun laws are aimed at the wrong target, curbing and criminalising legal ownership while failing to tackle huge rises in shooting offences over the past few years, according to an international firearms legislation expert.  Prof Gary Mauser said that Britain was making the same mistake as Canada and Australia in focusing on legal owners - a section of the law-abiding community where gun crimes, such as the Dunblane massacre, were aberrations .  The Home Office and police chiefs should instead tackle the possession of guns in criminal hands, said Prof Mauser, a member of the independent Fraser Institute in Canada. He has given evidence to select committees of the House of Commons and the Canadian Senate and predicted the escalation of gun crime on Britain's streets.  His warning comes as gun crime incidents are averaging about 29 a day in England and Wales, more than twice the level of when the Labour Government came to power in 1997 . In the past two years, there have been cases of schoolchildren and a baby, killed or injured by guns.  "I believe that factors of political correctness are at work," he said. "Police crackdowns, Home Office initiatives and over-regulation of legally held weapons create froth and they may even fool the police themselves into believing they are doing something about gun crime."  Prof Mauser added: "The sad truth is that while the police officers are inspecting farmers' gun cabinets to see if they comply with regulations somewhere in the UK, someone, who has not filled in a firearms certificate form, will be smuggling a gun into the country or selling one to an inner city youth."  Recorded gun crime rose by three per cent to 10,590 incidents in the year to June . Two-thirds of gun crime takes place in London, Birmingham and Manchester. It doesn't matter to these people that crime has skyrocketed since the irrational ban on private gun possession went into effect in Great Britain. Just as long as it's there, they feel safe.    .

   Get Off Their Backs     Scott   2004-11-16T13:47:00  From Reuters : U.S. Marines rallied round a comrade under investigation for killing a wounded Iraqi during the offensive in Falluja, saying he was probably under combat stress in unpredictable, hair-trigger circumstances.  Marines interviewed on Tuesday said they didn't see the shooting as a scandal, rather the act of a comrade who faced intense pressure during the effort to quell the insurgency in the city.  "I can see why he would do it. He was probably running around being shot at for days on end in Falluja. There should be an investigation but they should look into the circumstances," said Lance Corporal Christopher Hanson.  "I would have shot the insurgent too. Two shots to the head," said Sergeant Nicholas Graham, 24, of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. "You can't trust these people. He should not be investigated. He did nothing wrong." Of course the anti-American world press is jumping all over this story, casually omitting the fact that just a day earlier the marine in question lost a fellow soldier who was attending to a dead insurgent that was booby-trapped with explosives.  Add the tactic of booby-trapping your own dead to the effective suicide bombings, and it's clear to say that the Geneva Convention isn't on the minds of the insurgents. For that I believe the Marines should handle dead and wounded insurgents by any means necessary to ensure their own safety and prevent a possible ambush. I'm no fan of this war either, but it irks me to no end reading and listening to civilian opinions on how soldiers should conduct themselves in hostile war zones from their comfortable recliners.  To the world press and everyone else who despises the United States: You don't have to like our president or those operating this war, but get off the backs of the 18, 19 and 20 year-olds thrown into a situation you will never see or have to encounter. I've got too many friends in Iraq right now I want to see come home alive and well, and I will support them at every opportunity.    .

   Not to be Ignored     Scott   2004-12-01T23:13:00  More than a few e-mails have come in wondering why I haven't remarked on the horrible hunting tragedy on Nov. 21 that left six people dead, and why I haven't updated the ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN COUNTER.  I didn't mean to wait this long and never intended to ignore the issue, but I have been extremely busy last week with Thanksgiving and everything that goes along with it. This is problem that needs to be addressed.  But as for the assault weapons ban issue, the man accused of the brutal killings, Chai Vang of St. Paul, Minn, used a Russian-built Saiga 7.62 mm, SKS semiautomatic rifle.  As this article points out, the SKS wasn't included on the list of banned weapons as part of the 10-year ban on certain "assault weapons" signed by President Clinton. The ban expired in September and at the since the ban expired.  But let's talk about this case, as I'm sure discussions have started and many want stronger gun control because of this freak incident. While the media use words like "military style," "assault" and "semiautomatic," the gun used in the slayings was not unlike a typical hunting rifle.  The SKS is a medium-powered carbine equipped with a 10-round magazine, just like the pistol I'm displaying in the photo on the left hand side of this blog. Banned weapons had capacities of more than 10 rounds; so like my small 9mm, the SKS was not classified as an "assault" weapon. So let's not center our discussion around the gun, let's talk about the person behind the trigger.  If convicted of the killings, Vang faces life in prison as Minnesota does not honor the death penalty. I look forward to Vang's conviction and I pray for the families of the victims. What happened was indefensible and justice must be served.    .

   Life-Saving Disease     Scott   2004-12-03T19:59:00  Here's an incredible story about an unsung hero until now. From BBC News : A retired Italian doctor has revealed for the first time how he invented a fictitious disease which fooled the Nazis during World War II. The trick of prescribing Jews with a mysterious illness terrified the Nazis and saved 45 Roman Jews.  Dr Vittorio Sacerdoti has told his remarkable tale on the 60th anniversary of liberation of Rome. Just 28 years old at the time, he used courage and ingenuity to save 45 people from certain death.  As other Jews were being rounded up, Dr Sacerdoti admitted anyone who could reach the hospital as patients - and diagnosed them with a dangerous disease.  "We would write on their medical forms that the patient was suffering from K Syndrome," he said. "We called it K after the German commander Kesserling - the Nazis thought it was cancer or tuberculosis, and they fled like rabbits."  K Syndrome saved his cousin, Luciana Sacerdoti, who was just 10 years old.  "The day the Nazis came to the hospital, someone came to our room and said: 'You have to cough, you have to cough a lot because they are afraid of the coughing, they don't want to catch an awful disease and they won't enter'."    .

   It's Just Armor     Scott   2004-12-08T21:33:00  Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld took part in a Q&A with the troops today that was anything but cozy. Disgruntled soldiers complained to Rumsfeld about long deployments and a lack of armored vehicles and other equipment. From the Associated Press : "You go to war with the Army you have," Rumsfeld replied, "not the Army you might want or wish to have."  Spc. Thomas Wilson had asked the defense secretary, "Why do we soldiers have to dig through local landfills for pieces of scrap metal and compromised ballistic glass to up-armor our vehicles?" Shouts of approval and applause arose from the estimated 2,300 soldiers who had assembled to see Rumsfeld.  "We do not have proper armored vehicles to carry with us north," Wilson, 31, of Nashville, Tenn., concluded after asking again.  Wilson, an airplane mechanic whose unit, the 278th Regimental Combat Team of the Tennessee Army National Guard, is about to drive north into Iraq for a one-year tour of duty, put his finger on a problem that has bedeviled the Pentagon for more than a year. Rarely, though, is it put so bluntly in a public forum.  Rumsfeld said the Army was sparing no expense or effort to acquire as many Humvees and other vehicles with extra armor as it can. What is more, he said, armor is not the savior some think it is.  "You can have all the armor in the world on a tank and a tank can (still) be blown up," he said. Can't say that's the most comforting answer.    .

   Protect Yourself Not in San Francisco     Scott   2004-12-15T23:02:00  From the Associated Press : City residents will vote next year on a proposed weapons ban that would deny handguns to everyone except law enforcement officers, members of the military and security guards.  If passed next November, residents would have 90 days to give up firearms they keep in their homes or businesses. The proposal was immediately dismissed as illegal by a gun owners group.  Firearms would be allowed only for police officers, security guards, members of the military, and anyone else "actually employed and engaged in protecting and preserving property or life within the scope of his or her employment," according to the measure.  Gun Owners of California, a Sacramento-based lobbying group, quickly called the ban illegal. Sam Paredes, the group's executive director, said state law bars local governments from usurping the state's authority to regulate firearms.  "The amazing thing is they are going to turn San Francisco into ground zero for every criminal who wants to profit at their chosen profession," Paredes said.  Washington, D.C., is the only major American city that currently bans handgun possession by private citizens. Andrew Arulanandam, director of public affairs for the National Rifle Association, said San Francisco would be remiss to use that city as a model.  "If gun control worked, Washington, D.C., would be the beacon. However, it's the murder capital of the United States," he said.  If approved, the weapons ban would take effect in January 2006. Quote of the day: "Firearms would be allowed only for police officers, security guards, members of the military, and anyone else actually employed and engaged in protecting and preserving property or life within the scope of his or her employment."  So preserving property or life within the scope of self-defense and protection of the home is not allowed. No thanks. If the people vote for this measure it will be hard to sympathize with them when robbery and rape rates skyrocket, because burgulars will know homes are not guarded, and rapists will know the only thing stopping them from the victim they desire is their own inhibitions.    .

   No 2nd Amendment in the Valley     Scott   2004-12-18T01:46:00  San Francisco is apparently bored with just being the gay capital of America and is trying to muscle out Washington DC for the prestigious title of murder capital. It's possible, now that San Francisco officials have proposed a law that mimics the infamous DC gun ban. Columnist Michelle Malkin is one of the few columnists/bloggers who has picked up on the story.  As I said in a previous post it's all up to the voters.    .

   Woman Charged With Murder, Kidnapping Fetus-Thingy     Scott   2004-12-18T10:04:00  From the Associated Press : A baby girl who had been cut out of her mother's womb was found after a frantic search, and authorities arrested the woman they say strangled the mother and stole the child. The baby was in good condition Saturday.  Lisa M. Montgomery, 36, of Melvern, Kan., was arrested later Friday and charged with kidnapping resulting in death. Bobbie Jo Stinnett, 23, was found Thursday in a pool of blood inside her small white home in Skidmore, a town in northwest Missouri.  Stinnett, who was eight months pregnant, had earlier been talking with her mother on the phone, and hung up saying a woman she had chatted with online had just arrived at her door, authorities said.  U.S. Attorney Todd Graves said Montgomery contacted Stinnett through an online message board, and authorities zeroed in on her using computer forensics. Montgomery was seeking to buy a dog from Stinnett, who raised rat terriers, he said.  According to the criminal complaint, Montgomery traveled about 40 miles to Topeka, Kan., on Thursday to go shopping. Her husband received a call from her saying she had gone into labor and given birth. The next day, authorities say, Montgomery confessed that she strangled Stinnett from behind, cut her open, removed the baby and cut her umbilical cord. I don't understand how we can call this fetus-thing that was ripped from a mother's womb a "child" or "girl" in a society that sanctions partial-birth abortion. If you can't charge someone for killing a fetus via abortion during the eighth month, then surely you can't make a big deal about a woman who kidnapped a fetus that survived the knifing.  On a less-sarcastic note, I pray for the family of the 23-year-old woman. No one should have to die because some crazy nut wanted a child and decided to kill for it. If there's any good news in this story, it's that Victoria Jo will live on and carry her mother's memory. Question for the pro-choicers: Being that it isn't yet the ninth month, can we still charge the killer with kidnapping?    .

   Democrats Finally Getting it Right on Abortion?     Scott   2004-12-23T14:49:00  This is absolutely amazing news. Finally, the Democrats are finally realizing that the American people support the rights of unborn children and may soon revamp their platform to accommodate the morals and values that at least half of this country possesses. Of course, I'm sure the Democrats would also like to start winning elections again. From the Los Angeles Times : After long defining itself as an undisputed defender of abortion rights, the Democratic Party is suddenly locked in an internal struggle over whether to redefine its position to appeal to a broader array of voters.  The fight is a central theme of the contest to head the Democratic National, particularly between two leading candidates: former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, who supports abortion rights, and former Indiana Rep. Tim Roemer, an abortion foe who argues that the party cannot rebound from its losses in the November election unless it shows more tolerance on one of society's most emotional conflicts. No Democrat with any respect for his unraveling party would ever mention Howard Dean's name again. The fact that he didn't win a single primary outside his home state shows that the country does not embrace his radical liberalism.  Of course outspoken organizations such as Planned Parenthood, which gives a lot of money to Democrats, will fight with everything they've got to keep the Democratic platform as liberal as possible.  Results from the last few elections suggest that wouldn't be such a good idea if they ever want to gain more power in Congress.    .

   In the NFL     Scott   2004-12-26T17:12:00  Peyton Manning broke Dan Marino's season touchdown record today with 49 against the San Diego Chargers in a thrilling game that ended in overtime. I was happy to see Manning break the record, as last week he decided to take a knee to end the game against the Baltimore Ravens when he could have tried to increase the lead even more by throwing a touchdown. Manning is all class and ranks with the best quarterbacks of all time. Marino's 48 TD record was set in 1984.  On a much sadder note, the Minister of Defense, Reggie White, died of heart attack this morning in his home at the age of 43. White played a total of 15 years with Philadelphia, Green Bay and Carolina. He retired after the 2000 season as the NFL's all-time leader in sacks with 198. The mark has since been passed by Bruce Smith.  White will surely be missed.    .

   Throw in the Towel     Scott   2005-01-05T13:44:00  Perhaps Father Simpson was too busy telling reporters how hot he thinks his daughter, Jessica, is to wake and up and realize that his other daughter, Ashlee, is making a complete fool of herself.  Back in November I linked to this fraud's malfunctioned SNL performance when a technical glitch caused the vocal track from her first song to repeat during the second, proving she lip-synchs, even though she has been quoted saying she doesn't.  The humiliation and assault-on-music continued last night, when for some reason she decided to use her own voice in a wretched halftime performance at the Orange Bowl which ended in a shower of boos. You can see the video here if you can stand to watch a young no-talent wannabe continue to humiliate herself in public.  The best thing Ms. Simpson can do at this point is to just stop trying and end her music career. She has already made enough money from her debut album (never again) to live out the rest of her life in some secluded California mansion. There is nothing more to the story.    .

   Mass Child Killer Gets New Trial     Scott   2005-01-06T13:10:00  Feminists have a reason to celebrate today as an appeals court just threw out the convictions of their martyr, Andrea Yates, by ruling that one of the prosecutor's expert witnesses gave false testimony at her trial.  Yates, in case you have forgotten, is the women from Texas who heinously drowned her five kids, aged 6 months to 7 years, one by one, in her bathtub. Liberal feminist organizations rushed to Yates' defense, most notably the National Organization for Women, which provided money for her defense fund and held candlelight vigils. No such ceremonies were held for her five dead children.  In 2002 a jury sentenced Yates to life in prison for the deaths of three of her children. She was not tried in the deaths of the other two. Today the 1st Court of Appeals overturned the convictions and ordered a new trial. We can only hope for the same verdict.    .

   Now We'll Just Kill Boys     Scott   2005-01-07T20:12:00  The blood red nation of China is trying to curb the effects of a devastating 20-year-old policy that outlawed women from having more than one child. As a result, only about 100 girls are born for every 119 boys, because couples traditionally favor males.  Beijing has set a goal of reversing the imbalance by 2010, and to do this they will outlaw the selective abortion of female fetuses to correct an imbalance in the ratio of boys to girls. So now by killing the males they can hopefully narrow the gender gap. What a country!  From Reuters : Sex-selective abortion is already banned but technologies such as ultrasound have made it easier to know a baby's gender in advance, increasing the chances for aborting girls.  Despite a desire to curb the sex imbalance and a relaxation in recent years that allows rural families to have two children if the first is a girl, China has shown no sign of abandoning the one-child policy and cracks down on those who advocate against it.  One such activist is Mao Hengfeng, who was dismissed in 1988 from her job at a Shanghai soap factory after becoming pregnant a second time.  Last April, the Shanghai public security bureau sentenced her to 18 months in a labor camp for campaigning against the one-child policy. In other news: feminists still believe they're second-class citizens in the United States.    .

   Dangerous Colors     Scott   2005-01-09T16:27:00  Planned Parenthood, one of the worst organizations in the country, has been distributing poor condoms -- which liberals believe should be freely available in all high school clinics nationwide -- according to Consumer Reports which released its rankings this week. From Sun-Sentinal : Two of the three types of free condoms offered by Planned Parenthood received poor ratings, according to rankings that appear in the February issue of Consumer Reports, which hits newsstands Wednesday.  Planned Parenthood has since redesigned its "Honeydew" condom, which was the magazine's lowest-ranked brand with two "poor" ratings in strength and reliability. The group resubmitted all three of its brands for independent testing and received "excellent results," said Karen Pearl, president and chief executive of Planned Parenthood of Nassau County. The group's "Assorted Colors" brand was ranked next-to-last with a "poor" mark for strength but an "excellent" for reliability. The "Lollipop" got an overall "excellent" rating. Pretty scary that poorly rated condoms have been available to teens, both those looking for free sex and those who happen to attend public school. Even worse, it took a whistleblower to get Planned Parenthood to strengthen its product.  Lollipop anyone?    .

   The Grinch Loses Again     Scott   2005-01-14T19:22:00  From the Associated Press : An atheist who tried to remove "under God" from the Pledge of Allegiance lost a bid Friday to bar the saying of a Christian prayer at President Bush's inauguration.  Newdow argued that saying a Christian prayer at the Jan. 20 ceremony would violate the Constitution by forcing him to accept unwanted religious beliefs.  Attorneys representing Bush and his inaugural committee argued that prayers have been widely accepted at inaugurals for more than 200 years and that Bush's decision to have a minister recite the invocation was a personal choice the court had no power to prevent. Forcing him to accept unwanted religious beliefs? No wonder you can't win an argument against a secularist. They believe any inclusion of religious beliefs in one's own personal ceremony is somehow an operation to indoctrinate the hoi polloi.    .

   There's Always Plan B     Scott   2005-01-16T21:49:00  The Food and Drug Administration is considering whether to make morning-after birth control available without a prescription. The FDA may decide as soon as this week whether drug stores can sell the emergency contraception known as Plan B without a prescription to women age 16 and older.  Here is where I break with my conservative base and support the availability of Plan B which can prevent pregnancy for up to 72 hours after sex. With an 89% success rate, we can be optimistic that we are on the right path to ending unwanted pregnancy that doesn't involve a scalpel or suction tube.  Conservatives say people will be less reluctant to have risky and unprotected sex if they've got a box of B under the nightstand where condoms traditionally collect. But I would rather Plan B be used to prevent pregnancy than the liberals' preferred method; a fork in the head and a knife to the spinal cord.    .

   March Against Death     Scott   2005-01-24T13:54:00  This past weekend marked the 32-year anniversary of Roe v.

Today, thousands of pro-life crusaders will participate in the March for Life in Washington D.C., to honor the defenseless children and hope for an eventual Supreme Court reversal.  A reversal would not only be a victory for those who value life, but also for the woman once known as Jane Roe -- now a passionate pro-life advocate trying to get the Supreme Court to overturn the case she once represented.

   Courts Say 'No' to Choose Life Plates     Scott   2005-01-25T01:36:00  From the Associated Press : The Supreme Court declined Monday to consider whether states may offer license plates with anti-abortion messages, leaving lower courts divided over whether the programs in a dozen states unconstitutionally restrict dissenting views.  Without comment, justices let stand a lower court ruling that said South Carolina's license plates, which bear the slogan "Choose Life," violate the First Amendment because abortion rights supporters weren't given a similar forum to express their beliefs. Say what?? Now the First Amendment guarantees all sides a fair voice? Where were liberals when Ralf Nader wanted such equality? And who on Earth could possibly have a problem with someone who paid $70 that went to a local crisis pregnancy program for an anti-abortion license plate?  Oh that's right. The dastardly people at Planned Parenthood. Because no one should be allowed to express an opinion that challenges the beliefs of the American Left.    .

   Staying the Course in Iraq     Scott   2005-02-03T13:56:00  A CNN poll asks readers to rate the president's State of the Union speech last night. After 90,000 votes Mr. Bush has a 'C-C+' grade across the board, meaning 45,000 Republicans gave him an 'A' and 45,000 liberals failed him.  But a new CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll suggests more people side with the president. 70 percent of respondents said Bush's policies on health care were positive, while 66 percent approved of the president's plan for Social Security. 78 percent said U.S. policy in Iraq is hading in the right direction, a 12 percentage point increase over pre-speech polling. Overall, 77 percent of respondents said Bush is taking the country in the right direction after the speech compared to 67 percent beforehand.  And who wasn't moved by the embrace of mother of a soldier killed in Iraq and the daughter of a man killed by Saddam Hussein's regime? It was a beautiful moment last night that resulted in the longest standing ovation of the evening.  Today the parents of Marine Corps Sgt. Byron Norwood said the Iraqi woman, Safia Taleb al-Suhail, had turned and introduced herself just before the speech.  "She thanked us for our son's sacrifice and made sure we knew the people in Iraq were grateful for the sacrifices that were made not just by our son, but by all of them," Janet Norwood said.  It was an uplifting moment suggesting that maybe we're doing the right thing. I talked to a friend currently serving in Iraq last night and he says morale is up and the presence of troops is a positive thing. They just can't pack up and leave. Not just yet. We must be patient.    .

   Worst Neighbor in the World     Scott   2005-02-05T19:54:00  We've all lived next to some pretty undesirable people at one point or another, but I can't imagine anyone being worse than this. A Colorado judge ordered two teen-age girls to pay about $900 for the distress a neighbor said they caused by giving her home-made cookies adorned with paper hearts.  The pair were ordered to pay $871.70 plus $39 in court costs after neighbor Wanita Renea Young, 49, filed a lawsuit complaining that the unsolicited cookies, left at her house after the girls knocked on her door, had triggered an anxiety attack that sent her to the hospital the next day.  Taylor Ostergaard, then 17, and Lindsey Jo Zellitte, 18, paid the judgment on Thursday after a small claims court ruling by La Plata County Court Judge Doug Walker, a court clerk said on Friday.  The girls baked cookies as a surprise for several of their rural Colorado neighbors on July 31 and dropped off small batches on their porches, accompanied by red or pink paper hearts and the message: "Have a great night."  The Denver Post newspaper reported on Friday that the girls had decided to stay home and bake the cookies rather than go to a dance where there might be cursing and drinking. Zebra Report has a picture of the good-intentioned girls. Maybe delinquency does pay off better.    .

   I Wanna Celebrate Murder Too!     Scott   2005-02-08T11:42:00  In a recent blog post Michelle Malkin mentions the "abortion jewelry" marketed by the lovely feminist of "Unf*cked P*ssy," Joanna Rytel. Not that I was surprised - considering not long ago we were introduced to a people who proudly donned the "I had an abortion" slogan with great pride on their t-shirts.  The first trackback entry is from the typical anti-Christian variety:  Ms. Rytel is absolutely correct, the anti-abortion Christians have managed to convice (sic) nearly everyone that abortion is wrong and people should feel horribly guilty over it. Like we haven't heard this rant before. Yes, only the Christians value life when it's a life before birth. Of course it would be wrong to make people feel "horribly guilty" over abortion, but celebrating the skull-cracking procedure "for the sake of the child" in the form of t-shirts and jewelry is to be admired. The problem for the pro-abortion movement is that hardly anyone is taking a stand to reverse this societal brainwashing. Even by calling the movement "pro-choice" instead of "pro-abortion," it gives credence to the Christian loonies.  Here is where I agree with my fellow Libertarian. "Pro-choice" is a soft and weak label for what those people really truly represent. I prefer pro-murder, anti-life or anti-responsibility as a suitable replacement.    .

   What, a Criminal Ignored New York Gun Laws?     Scott   2005-02-13T21:23:00  From the Associated Press : A lone gunman opened fire with an assault rifle Sunday inside a crowded mall in upstate New York, wounding one person before running out of ammunition and being subdued by employees, authorities said.  The gunman began shooting inside the Hudson Valley Mall shortly after 3 p.m. in Kingston, nearly 90 miles north of New York City.  The 24-year-old gunman went into a Best Buy store and started firing. When he ran out of ammunition, he was captured by mall employees, police said.  Ulster Town Supervisor Fred Wadnola identified the gunman's weapon as an AK-47 assault rifle.  "Everyone was running and screaming. Then I heard the shots," witness Heather Craig told Fox News. Whoa! You're telling me someone was able to take an AK-47 "assault rifle" into a mall and injure people?! But it's New York. They have gun laws!  And because New York has such strict gun laws - meaning citizens are prohibited from concealing weapons - a gunner can use bag-toting shoppers as target practice because guns laws keep mall shoppers at his mercy.  Had an armed civilian been inside the mall, perhaps he could have intervened before the suspect began injuring people before he ran out of ammo.  But not in New York. Because there people like me who have never had so much as a traffic ticket in life cannot conceal weapons, unlike in Florida, where you walk past us everyday without even knowing it.    .

   Not Wise to Attack Floridians     Scott   2005-02-24T12:07:00  From the St. Pete Times : Some Florida legislators want to give people the right to shoot an attacker in a public place.  A House committee voted Wednesday to allow people to shoot to kill in self-defense if they are attacked "in any other place where he or she has a right to be." Sponsored by Rep. Dennis Baxley, an Ocala Republican, the bill (HB 249) passed 13-0.  State law defines deadly force as that which is likely to cause "death or great bodily harm," such as firing a gun at a person or a vehicle.  Florida courts consider deadly force a last resort and have held that a person being attacked has the "duty to use every reasonable means to avoid the danger, including retreat, prior to using deadly force."  But this legislation says a person who is under attack in a public place "has no duty to retreat."  "Law-abiding people should not be told that if they are attacked, they should turn around and run," NRA lobbyist Marion Hammer told lawmakers. "This bill gives back rights that have been eroded and taken away by a judicial system that at times appears to give preferential treatment to criminals."  Baxley held up a stack of more than 800 e-mails from Floridians who he said have written him to support the bill. He said 62 House members, a majority, have endorsed his bill, and supporters include Attorney General Charlie Crist and groups representing Florida sheriffs, police chiefs and police officers.  Rep. Jeff Kottkamp, R-Cape Coral, said the bill reminded him of a sign he saw on a constituent's house while campaigning door-to-door. Kottkamp said the sign, next to a doorbell, showed a smoking .44-Magnum handgun and the words: "We don't dial 911." This is great news for Florida gun carriers because now to defend yourself you don't have to first make sure a "duty to retreat" is impossible. Currently, if one's life is threatened he/she must make sure it is impossible to escape before using deadly force on an attacker.    .

   Death by Assault Weapon     Scott   2005-02-24T22:52:00  164 days after the expiration of the federal "assault weapons" ban some lunatic opened fire with an AK-47 outside a Texas courthouse.  A brave civilian with a concealed weapons permit tried to stop him but was gunned down by David Hernandez Arroyo Sr, the scumbag who happened to be wearing body armor at the time and who also took out his ex-wife over a child support dispute. Nice.  I wouldn't be surprised if this Arroyo character (who was killed by police as he tried to flee) had a serious criminal past but has been allowed to walk free due to our lax judicial process.  Should this be a call for more gun control?  Absolutely not. This case tells us two things: that concealed weapons permit holders respond faster than police because we are in greater numbers, and that criminals wear body armor too - so it's ridiculous to claim that we should outlaw guns that are "too powerful" for civilian use.  Perhaps someone with a Five-seveN (the gun the Brady Campaign calls the "cop-killer" and is trying to ban) could have been more effective at stopping the armor-wearing gunner.  God bless you, Mark Wilson, 52, a true patriot who died today trying to stop this despicable maniac.    .

   The Times, They Are a Changin'     Jim Bacon   2005-01-23T16:39:00  Speaking of major campaign contributors, here's the most interesting story to be culled from the Virginia Public Access Project. The single largest political donor in the second half of 2004 was Sheila C. Johnson, of the Plains, who made five contributions totaling $320,490. ( See CPAP profile .)  What's so special about Sheila Johnson? Not only is she developing the Salamander Inn & Spa in Fauquier County, and not only is she a major philanthropist, but she was a co-founder of of Black Entertainment Television with her ex-husband Robert L. Johnson. If you haven't figured it out yet, she is an African-American. I know that doesn't fit the dominant, minorities-are-still-disenfranchised narrative of the mainstream media. But the Old Dominion has come a long way, in my humble opinion, when the biggest campaign contributor in the state is African American.  You know we've come along way when African Americans aren't just winning elected office, as former Gov. Douglas Wilder did, but they're bankrolling candidates for office-- white candidates for office. Johnson's donations last year included $287,490 for Domocratic gubernatorial hopeful Tim Kaine.    .

   Dissecting the Dollars     Will Vehrs   2005-01-25T11:08:00  Jim, you're not the only one mining the data on political contributions. Over at the blog sic semper tyrannis , "Addison" has an interesting post on the top donors to Speaker Howell's PAC.    E M Risse   ????-??-??T11:31:00  Jim and Will:  Have some fun and check the "Northern Virginia Supporters" on the Baril web site. Just the folks who support his father-in-law on the condition he support their road plans.  EMR    Paul   ????-??-??T12:33:00  Just wanted to add this to the discussion - I recently received this press release from the Werkheiser campaign in NOVA - might this be the ONLY COMPETITIVE RACE THIS YEAR?!??! Pathetic...  WERKHEISER OUT-RAISES OPPONENT AND LEADS CHALLENGERS STATEWIDE  Greg Werkheiser, candidate for the House of Delegates from the 42nd District in southern Fairfax County, has raised significantly more money to date than his incumbent opponent, David Albo, and leads all challengers statewide in fundraising, according to reports filed with the State Board of Elections on January 18, 2005.  Werkheiser out-raised his opponent by almost 2 to 1: Werkheiser $81,615; Albo $55,119.  Werkheiser now has twice as much unencumbered cash on hand as his opponent: Werkheiser $50,017; Albo $23,767  Werkheiser's contributions come from 200 individuals; Albo had 8 individual contributors.  Werkheiser leads all challengers statewide in total contributions raised and funds on-hand.  The 42nd House of Delegates District forms the southern tip of Fairfax County. Nearly fifty-two percent of the district voted for John Kerry in 2004, and Governor Mark Warner won the district with similar margins in 2001.  "I am humbled by the support of so many citizens in the 42nd District who are voting with their pocketbooks for a change in leadership. While we are very pleased with this outpouring of support, I am going to keep doing what I have been doing: listening to my neighbors and working to make our communities in Fairfax County a better place to live, work and raise a family," stated Werkheiser.

   Economic Development Accountability?     Will Vehrs   2005-01-27T10:17:00  The Augusta Free Press (motto: "Our only agenda is the truth") has a Chris Graham story on a Del. Chap Peterson, D-Fairfax, bill that would require payback by companies lured to Virginia by incentives if they do not stay for five years. The text of HB2898 is here .  Peterson, of course, is a candidate for the Lt. Governor nomination. Graham's article has the interesting hook of quoting one of Peterson's rivals, former Congresswoman and State Sen. Leslie Byrne, as approving of the measure because it's "something that I've been talking about for some time now."  The Virginia Economic Developers Association has not taken a stance on the bill, but the organization's leadership is expected to meet tomorrow to discuss it. Demanding accountability from economic development is a rare phenomenon. I would expect them to oppose it.  If anybody would like to debate the merits of this proposal or discuss economic development in general, the comment section is open.  PS One of our Bacons Rebellion contributors, Steven Sisson, offers this testimonial: "Without a doubt, The Augusta Free Press is the best thing since sliced bread!" Hey, what's this blog, chopped liver?    Jim Bacon   ????-??-??T12:26:00  If I recall correctly, the last time that Virginia seriously addressed the "incentives" issue was during the Allen administration. The idea then was to peg incentives to performance: If the touted jobs and investment don't materialize, you lose the tax breaks and incentives. By demanding accountability, Peterson's bill is in the spirit of Virginia's existing policy, thought perhaps somewhat tougher.    Steven Sisson   ????-??-??T18:02:00  Will Verhrs wrote: "Hey, what's this blog, chopped liver?"  I'm not a certifiable Blogophile yet.  In my estimation, the Bacon's Rebellion blog is nothing more than "Bacon Bits" but don't blog me wrong, because I love bacon bits on salads.  The same might be said of Chap's condiment-packaged business bill.  Delegate Chap Petersen bill is nothing more than salt and pepper electioneering in the 2005 statewide campaign -- and is probably tied into the Democratic outsourcing clamor and growing threat of more manufacturing plants closing, which John Kerry politically contrived and sensationalized for the 04 presidential run.  Residents throughout the commonwealth of Virginia and the rest of the nation are economically vulnerable due to free trade agreements and the global economy. But both parties are responsible and have voted in favor of those agreements.  Lt. Governor candidate's Chap Peterson and Leslie Byrne are both good politicians, but need to start thinking outside the box with legislation that will attract and benefit economic growth for the business world and create sustainable workplaces for Virginians.  Will, I agree with your analysis, the VA business community along with a majority of GA members will probably deep-six this 5-year mandatory requirement for compensation due to relocation.  If not bordering on the political ridorkulous (ridiculously dorky), it's just plain ludicrous to believe business owners would agree to a capital investment with strings attached to the businesses health and longevity.  Reward-to-punishment-to-reward maybe good dog training techniques, but it's not very business friendly.  The Commonwealth needs legislation that requires a mandatory Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) within the contractual economic development agreements. The ESOP is itself a corporate finance vehicle that provides monetary incentives with lending institutes, state and federal tax benefits, new capital investment, and most of all, the stock ownership plan increases VA employee capital wealth.  More capital wealth will drive our consumer-base economy through the flipping roof.  But most importantly, how many Virginia businesses will choose to relocate -- or outsource when employee are the corporate stockowners? And lets say the business has no other choice but to remove to the third world ...  When Virginia's employees are fully vested in company stock, they will also reap from the profits of lower wages in the global marketplace just like the corporate big boys.  It's Win-Win -- sort of.    Phil Rodokanakis   ????-??-??T19:33:00  Steve Sisson said: "Lt. Governor candidate's Chap Peterson and Leslie Byrne are both good politicians..."  Define what makes a "good politician!" If one defines being on the extreme liberal fringe of the Democart party as good, than Byrne surely qualifies under that label. Peterson is slightly to the right of Byrne, but not by much...  Frankly, I don't consider tax and spend liberals as good politicians. Unfortunately, the Republican Party is also loaded with its share of irresponsible big spenders, but hopefully some of them will be held accountable during the 2005 primary elections. On the other hand, I have yet to see any Democrats challenge incumbents for being fiscally irresponsible.    Scott   ????-??-??T10:42:00  Accountbility is important. I hope Wilder will return it to Richmond. For years we have seen abuse by 'public-private' partnerships like Richmond Renaissance and now VPAF. I would like to see the bill applied to the shady Broad Street CDA.    .

   The Prof Ponies Up!     Barnie Day   2005-02-04T13:26:00  Renowned UVA political scientist Larry Sabato this morning announced a $1,000,000 cash gift to the University of Virginia. The gift, payable over three years, is the largest ever given the university by an active faculty member, according to UVA President John Casteen. Sabato has written 23 books. Some of them have been read!  Mostly lifted from the Associated Press    Jim Bacon   ????-??-??T20:45:00  That's pretty darn generous. Was it HIS money?    Will Vehrs   ????-??-??T20:45:00  I'm not ashamed to say that I'm in the tank for Professor Sabato. He maintains his political independence as well as any pundit and this donation affirms that the words he's always used to describe his commitment to UVA are genuine. He could have moved on to any number of tv or print opportunities, but has stayed in Charlottesville to continue his good works.  I'd suggest Wahoos disenchanted with Pete Gillen rally around Sabato as the embodiment of their university's excellence.    .

   Other Voices     Will Vehrs   2005-02-05T19:19:00  With no web presence, publications like the Richmond Free Press are rarely acknowledged in the blogosphere. The RFP serves the African-American community in the City of Richmond.  In the latest edition, staff writer Jeremy M. Lazarus reports that the Legislative Black Caucus celebrated killing a bill that would have merged the Department of Minority Business Enterprise (DMBE) with the Department of Business Assistance (DBA). Del. Dwight Jones (D-Richmond), chair of the caucus, said killing the bill had been their "main objective" in an effort to, according to Lazarus, "promote economic justice for black businesses."  I believe any neutral management consultant worth his or her salt would recommend a merger of the two organizations. There is considerable duplication of effort and DBA is strong in one area--financial controls--where DMBE has consistently had problems. There would be service benefits to business clients, too. Nonetheless, the symbolism of having their "own" agency and support from Governor Warner for maintaining DMBE's "independence" apparently overcame any efficiency and service argument.  Another article, this one by staff writer Skeeter Faulk, describes Sen. George Allen's commitment to naming the new Federal courthouse in downtown Richmond for Spottswood W. Robinson III, a noted NAACP lawyer and federal judge. Robinson worked with Thurgood Marshall on Brown v. Board of Education . Faulk finds the nomination a "surprise" in light of Allen's past, when he "embraced and glorified the Confederate flag and its sympathizers." Faulk chalks the naming up to Allen's presidential ambitions.  It's tough to be a Republican when it comes to the African-American community. Do nothing and you confirm their worst suspicions; do something and it arouses a different kind of suspicion.    Jim Bacon   ????-??-??T17:26:00  Will, I share your frustration at the reaction to Allen's nod to Spottswood Robins. Among some segments of the African-American community, it is indeed a matter of damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don't. But you could say the same thing of the Democratic Party as a whole.  I think it's important to recognize that African Americans, though still overwhelmingly Democratic, comprise less of a monolith than they did 20-30 years ago. I find myself continually amazed at how open-minded many young African-Americans are. And I think that open-mindedness goes a long way to explain the desperate efforts of many (not all, but many) within the Democratic Party to circle the wagons with the cry of "racism, racism, racism" when the evidence of racism is increasingly a stretch. It's like how, after the Civil War, Republicans "waved the bloody shirt", associating the Democratic Party with the secession and, ultimately, the war itself. Eventually, that tactic lost its power. And so, too, will the cries of racism, racism.    Scott   ????-??-??T11:15:00  Agreed.  More importantly, the lack of disclosure is frightening. Media General/Times Dispatch, Richmond.com, and the Richmond Free Press all have significant ties to the VPAF's proposed Virginia Performing Arts Center, yet we do not see anything resembling balanced coverage of the controversy and debate surrounding this issue.    .

   Not In Virginia, I Hope     Will Vehrs   2005-02-10T07:28:00  Here's my second morning NPR post in a row ... Mickey Kaus in Slate was listening: Here's how NPR's All Things Considered covered President Bush's proposed cuts in Community Development Block Grants --by lobbing softballs to a CDBG supporter! No opposing view. ... This is not just liberal, but dumb liberal--NPR could easily have found a Democrat, maybe even an old Democrat, who believed CDBGs are an ineffective antipoverty program. (Basically they are slush funds for local politicians, who too often sluice the federal money to their developer friends to build ugly downtown hotels.) It's my sense that in Virginia, the CDBG program is used extensively in rural areas and, on the whole, has done some good. Maybe someone knows of CDBG funds used in Virginia as Mickey describes. I hope not, but, if so, it looks like there won't be as much of that in the future.    .

   Kaine on Death and Taxes     Jim Bacon   2005-02-14T09:44:00  by Steven Sisson  Choir boy Tim Kaine is a political moderate informed by his Catholic beliefs. But look for the Kilgore team to paint him as a liberal for his record on tax hikes and the death penalty.  The Blue Dog personally views Lt. Gov. Tim Kaine as a moderate-to-conservative politician. Kaine has never been an Amway Christian, nor does he hold a lifetime membership to the C-E Club (i.e., only attending church service on Christmas and Easter holidays). More    Anonymous   ????-??-??T07:49:00  Kaine a "moderate to conservative"? Who is this guy trying to kid? Kaine is as liberal as they come. Who other than a left-wing liberal would agree to represent a two-time murderer (Lem Tugle) for free, to try and keep him from getting the death penalty. Tugle was on trial for raping and killing a southwest Virginia grandmother. After killing her, he dumped her body down the same ditch where he dumped the 17-year-old girl he had previously been convicted of murdering. Tugle was on parole for this crime when he killed the grandmother.  I understand that representing people is what attorneys do but even attorneys have some choice in whom they represent. The line of defense Kaine used was that Tugle had not really raped the grandmother because "forcable sodomy was not rape according to the law at the time."    .

   Car Tax Cut Acceleration Hits a Wall     Barnie Day   2005-02-16T15:36:00  As expected the Senate Finance Committee this afternoon killed a proposal by House Republicans to finish implementation of the car tax cut by phasing out the remaining 30% over the next six years. The move leaves intact state reimbursement for the locally-imposed property tax at an aggregate of $950 million annually. At present, that amount covers approximately 70% of the tax for the average affected car owner.

How does a body that wants to raise taxes to pump more money into transportation next year get to "bitch slap" more money now?    Phil Rodokanakis   ????-??-??T20:06:00  What is becoming abundantly clear is that it's either Chichester's way or the highway (pun intended)    Paul   ????-??-??T09:42:00  Tis a sad day for Dave Albo's law firm, which was counting on him to push the abuser fees bill and bring them more clients. Can we have a moment of silence?    Joe Freeman   ????-??-??T10:09:00  If bitch slaps are administered to keep the 'ho servicing the clients, who's the client here? Since the gubernatorial race in the fall undoubtedly dominates all decisions from this point on, could it be a client who must be serviced to serve November purposes? Could it be those who will forego a little now, and are willing to give a lot before Nobvember, in order to get a whole lot more in 2006?    .

   Anti-Gerrymandering: Is Virginia Ready?     Will Vehrs   2005-02-17T07:44:00  Many of the good-governiks who write for Bacon's Rebellion have pointed out the deleterious effects of gerrymandering on Virginia. Some would say the problems are on display in Capitol Square right now.  There's an anti-gerrymandering movement gaining a small head of steam in California. The Golden State often leads the way for the nation on "reform," for good or ill. Mickey Kaus of Slate reminds us that the California initiative bears watching and we should follow the motives of those who support or oppose the current redistricting process.  Mickey cites two Stuart Taylor articles on the subject that should be required reading for any who would debate the issue, here and here .    Barnie Day   ????-??-??T09:01:00  Hand in hand with any consideration of the redistricting process, we shoul give some thought to the structural relationship between the state House and Senate. Currently, each House member represents approximately 75,000 Virginians, while each Senator represents appoximately 187,500. Often as not, there is no rational commonality between the two. Some senators represent people pools that are in turn fractured into five or six House districts. I believe this accounts, in large part, for the dysfunction that characterizes our state government now. Former Governor Gerald Baliles, in this same vein, has advocated a realignment of the two houses in a way that serves commonalities. He has suggested that we either increase membership in the Senate to 50, or decrease House membership to 80, producing a scenario wherein 1 Senator would represent a block of people who are represented by exactly 2 Delegates. He thinks--and I think he is right--that this arrangement would foster a closer working relationship between the Senate and the House. You certainly wouldn't have these dysfunctional groupings we now have, where 1 Senator often represents a population divided among half a dozen Delegates of two parties--three, if you count independents.    .

   What, No Poet Laureate?     Will Vehrs   2005-02-18T08:48:00  Back in 1996, budget cuts eliminated the job of State Archaeologist. Now, according to the Virginian-Pilot , the job is about to come back via HB 2078 . With all this surplus floating around and the Jamestown 2007 celebration coming up, who wants the state to be shorthanded in archaeology?

   Make a Wise Choice     Will Vehrs   2005-02-18T12:14:00  Virginia is apparently going to be build a data center in Richmond, a back-up data center, and a help desk/call center as a follow-on to the creation of VITA, the Virginia Information Technology Agency.  The Bristol Herald Courier editorial page is urging that the back-up center be built in Wise County to take advantage of UVA-Wise . SCHEV, of course, told the General Assembly that UVA-Wise didn't generate any economic development, so a new university in Southside wouldn't, either.  The Courier said Wise should get the center over Danville because there's no Southside university. No other candidate locations were identified.  I believe that any new state-wide service facilities should be located in either Southside or Southwest. If we can tie up all state procurement officials and all vendors in a quest to help under-represented small, minority, and woman-owned businesses, we should commit all new state facility spending in a quest to help our economically disadvantaged regions.

   Two Reactions, Two Worlds     Will Vehrs   2005-02-22T08:17:00  Del. Adam Ebbin (D, Alexandria) is the first openly gay member to serve in the House of Delegates. There's a brief profile of Ebbin by Kristen Gelineau in today's Daily Press . What I found interesting was the contrast in reactions to Ebbin from two colleagues: "I suppose that one of the concerns was that since he is the only openly gay member of the Legislature, is whether or not that would be the only issue that he would ... talk about," said Del. Ward Armstrong, D-Henry County. "That clearly has not been the case. He is a very versatile delegate."  Del. Richard Black, R-Loudoun, who has compiled a track record as one of the most socially conservative members of the state legislature and was the sponsor of the gay adoption bill, said he's not trying to stamp out gay rights but is simply trying to preserve tradition.  As for his personal feelings on Ebbin, after a lengthy pause, the Loudoun Republican offered: "He's always prompt and, you know, on time to meetings." A moment later, he added, "I think he works hard." I think it's possible to support some of Black's positions but still be very disappointed by his cold assessment of a colleague.    Paul   ????-??-??T11:16:00  Dick Black is a statesman.    Salt Lick   ????-??-??T14:33:00  Odd how different our perceptions are. I read Black's comment as more genuine and straightforward than Armstrong's. I'd much rather someone call me "prompt" and "hard-working" than "very versatile." The latter sounds like weasel words -- "Well," Johnnie's teacher said, "he's not too bright, and his table manners are atroctious, but he's very versatile."    Will Vehrs   ????-??-??T14:56:00  Maybe it was the pointed reference of the reporter to the pauses Black made that troubled me.  I appreciate your take on it; that's why I love this comment section. I may be way off-base.    Paul   ????-??-??T19:30:00  The Ward Armstrong comment is incredibly idiotic as well...    .

   A Pitiful, Helpless Giant     Will Vehrs   2005-02-22T13:48:00  Anyone who has spent any time in NVA over the last 40 years is familiar with the Giant grocery store chain. When the chain passed from its private owners a few years ago, problems began. These problems multiplied when the New England chain Stop n' Shop acquired Giant. Add new competition--Food Lion, Harris Teeter, and Wegman's--and loyalty to Giant, once an article of faith, is dissipating. It's a cautionary tale for business and for any long-standing organization seeking to change.  Michael Barbaro has an article on Giant's recent problems in the Washington Post , plus he took questions online today. One interesting note: most of the online negative comments about Giant come from Maryland residents. Most of the new stores competing with Giant are in Virginia.    Paul   ????-??-??T09:54:00  I'm new to this area (1 year) so I can't really comment on Giant. Seems like an ok store...I prefer Harris Teeter.  Now Ukrops! That's a well run enterprise.

   Where is Investigative Journalism?     Will Vehrs   2005-02-27T12:38:00  Governor Mark Warner has turned state government upside-down in an effort to do more business with small, women, and minority owned (SWAM) firms and the thanks he gets are headlines like this one in the Daily Press : Warner's plan to raise contracting diversity falls short .  The article is full of innuendo that procurement officals are ignoring the Governor's wishes and just waiting for him to leave office, that "special deals" are cut with non-SWAM vendors, and that somehow the electronic procurement system is "stacked" against SWAM firms. If true, these are serious charges, worthy of high-level investigation.  What's missing from the article, though, is any attempt at investigative journalism to give even one factual example supporting the innuendo. What's also missing is a fair-minded review of whether the sagging numbers reported for SWAM procurement are valid.  Someday a journalist is going to take the time to watch a sample number of SWAM firms submit bids on openly posted contracts, then use procurement tools that are in place to determine if any SWAM firms were unfairly denied contracts they deserved. Until then, this carping appears to be sour grapes. Governor Warner has done plenty to open up the system to SWAM firms and give them a presumptive advantage, even inviting a backlash by non-SWAM firms. Maybe SWAM firms aren't doing all they can to return the Governor's faith in them.    Jim Bacon   ????-??-??T10:39:00  The dominant narrative among the Mainstream Media, even at a local level, is that the institutions of U.S. society are, to varying degrees, racist. Any shortcomings in minority achievement are to be explained as the result of discrimination of some sort. End of story. What's to investigate? What need to examine "the other side of the story?"    .

   Condi the New Secretary of State     Curt   2004-11-15T16:13:00  Just reported from AP that Condi Rice has been chosen by President Bush to become the new Secretary of State for his second term. I agree with his choice and think she will make a much better Secretary then Powell did. Her views are much more in step with the President then Powell, although he was a true soldier and carried the message.  Plus, any lady who works out to Led Zeppelin and is a Football nut is alright in my book.     .

   James Baker, The New Village Idiot     Curt   2004-11-16T08:33:00  Thanks to Captain Ed for bringing this up. Apparently James Baker, former Secretary of State and current envoy for the Bush Administration, has asked the Isreali government to release a scumbag terrorist to promote "peace". There is now. . . . in an Israeli prison a man named Marwan Barghouti, who is one of the young guard of Palestinians, and if the Palestinians are going to make this work against the really hard-line elements, the Islamists and some of the people of Hamas, they're going to have to have a coalition of the young guard and the old guard." Gotta say that this shocked me, I've always thought Mr. Baker was a upstanding guy but this is just plain good old fashioned bullcrap.  Here are some of the fine achievements of the terrorist Marwan Barghouti Marwan Barghouti (born June 6, 1958) is a Palestinian leader from the West Bank and a leader of the Fatah movement that forms the backbone of the Palestinian Authority and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). On June 6, 2004, he was sentenced to five life sentences for five murders of Israeli civilians and 40 years imprisonment for attempted murders in terrorist attacks against Israeli civilians. Barghouti was one of the major leaders of the First Intifada in 1987, leading Palestinians in a mass uprising against Israeli occupation of the West Bank. During the uprising, he was arrested by Israel and deported to Jordan, where he stayed for seven years until he was permitted to return under the terms of the Oslo Accords in 1994. In 1996, he was elected to the Palestinian Legislative Council, in which he advocated peace with Israel, sometimes coming in conflict with Yasser Arafat. The formal position occupied by Barghouti was the General Secretary of Fatah in the West Bank.  By the summer of 2000, Barghouti and Arafat had grown increasingly at odds with each other, with Barghouti accusing Arafat's administration of corruption and his security services of human rights violations, and Arafat was planning to fire him shortly.  However, as the Second Intifada began, Barghouti became increasingly popular as a leader of the Fatah Tanzim militia. This was perhaps due to the transformation of Tanzim into an organization more resembling militant groups like Hamas and Islamic Jihad, responsible for dozens of civilian deaths in drive-by shootings. Under Barghouti, the Tanzim has also carried out suicide bombings in Israel under the name al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades.  What is he thinking? Release a known terrorist to run the PLO and that will bring about peace, give me a effin break     .

   Allies     Curt   2004-12-28T09:27:00  2Slick pointed me to a article at In Iraq For 365 . This is a great blog and I encourage you all to read it regularly. On Sunday he wrote of two Iraqi soldiers who didn't see us as conquerors but as allies when the Mosul bombing occurred. The suicide bomb sprayed bb-like fragments throughout the Marez dining facility. One piece of shrapnel sliced through the femoral artery of a U.S. soldier and his only chance for survival was in the hands of these two Iraqis.  Recalling the medical classes they'd received from the special forces, the Iraqis reacted calmly, fastening a belt above the wound, creating a tourniquet, which stopped the gushing stream of red. They moved the soldier to a MEDVAC vehicle via two-man litter carry. After they hoisted the soldier in the truck, the two Iraqis -- one an officer, the other an NCO -- ran back to the facility and began treating the other wounded without regard for their safety.  When the dust settled and the mess tent had been evacuated, everybody who could talk was questioned about their health. When the medics came to the two Iraqis, the ING soldiers only wanted to know how everybody else was. When asked why did they do it, they simply stated, "this was our duty; we are a team, and we take care of each other." Even the Americans. No matter what the MSM tries to tell you, there are Iraqi's who will help the allies, who will fight alongside them and put their lives at risk to make sure Democracy succeeds in their country. This brings to mind a speech Prime Minister Tony Blair gave recently while visiting Iraq. When I meet the people working alongside the United Nations--Iraqis in fear of their life every day, because they are trying to bring freedom and democracy to their people--when I see their courage and their determination and know that they speak for the vast majority of people in Iraq who want that democracy and freedom, then I know that we are doing the right thing. . . .  And I will also say this to you: There are people dying in Iraq, but the reason people are dying is because of the terrorism and the intimidation and the people who are deliberately killing anyone trying to make this country better.  Now what should our response be as an international community? Our response should be to stand alongside the democrats--the people who've got the courage to see this thing through--and help them see it through. I've got no doubt at all that that is the right thing for us to do. . . .  Sometimes when I see some of the reporting of what's happening in Iraq in the rest of the world, I just feel that people should understand how precious what has been created here is. And those people from that electoral commission that I described as the heroes of the new Iraq--every day . . . a lot of them aren't living in the Green Zone, they've got to travel in from outside. They do not know at any point in even death, and yet they carry on doing it. Now what a magnificent example of the human spirit--that's the side we should be on.     .

   Laser Beam Question     Curt   2004-12-30T18:44:00  This recent news story is troubling in many different ways. When I first heard of the story I figured it was some wackjob playing with a new toy but now we find out there have been 7 incidents since Christmas from the West to East coast. The FBI, concerned that terrorists could use lasers as weapons, is investigating why laser beams were directed into the cockpits of seven airplanes in flight since Christmas.  Laser beams can temporarily blind or disorient pilots and possibly cause a plane to crash.  The FBI is looking into two incidents in Colorado Springs, Colo., and one each in Cleveland, Washington, Houston, Teterboro, N.J., and Medford, Ore., according to federal and local law enforcement and transportation officials, some of whom spoke only on condition of anonymity.  A federal law enforcement official, who declined to be identified by name, said Thursday there is no evidence of a plot or terrorist activity. But pilots are troubled by the incidents, and the FBI earlier this month warned of the possibility that terrorists might use the devices as weapons.  "It's not some kid," said Paul Rancatore, a pilot who serves as deputy chairman of the security committee for the Allied Pilots Association. "It's too organized."  Loren Thompson, who teaches military technology at Georgetown University, called it a "rather worrisome development," though he said experts would be more puzzled than alarmed.  "What we're talking about is a fairly powerful visible light laser that has the ability to lock onto a fast-moving aircraft," Thompson said. "That's not the sort of thing you pick up at a military surplus store."  Thompson said a piece of equipment that could do the things the FBI suspects would be "fairly expensive and fairly sophisticated."  "It sounds like an organized effort to cause airline accidents," Thompson said. Michelle Malkin has a post about this today where some outlets have stopped selling lasers. Lots of people think that these indeed might be loonies playing with new Christmas toys but I disagree.  These are incidents where the Airplanes were tracked , some as high as 8500 feet. To track a fast moving plane at that altitude would not be some toy you can get from the local wal-mart. In my opinion this is quite alarming.  This Isn't Writing, It's Typing has a great post out with a ton of info, some of it quite scary A more frightening scenario is that terrorists may have obtained a Chinese-produced ZM-87 laser blinder which is specifically designed to blind eyesight. The Japanese terrorist cult Aum Shinrikyo--which launched the infamous Sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway system in 1995--was discovered to have experimented with the use of lasers as weapons.According to The Asian Pacific Post, "Cult members apparently obtained laser design information from Russian institutes they visited and built a laser weapon mounted on a truck. They had planned to use the laser against Tokyo policemen, but the plan failed when the laser malfunctioned during the testing stage." PoliticAlex also has some info on this story also.  I found the following report that was presented to Congress recently about the shoulder launched missle threat to airliners, which this might very well be a precursor to: Recent events have focused attention on the threat that terrorists with shoulder fired surface-to-air missiles (SAMs), referred to as Man-Portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADS), pose to commercial airliners. Most believe that no single solution exists to effectively mitigate this threat. Instead, a menu of options may be considered, including installing infrared (IR) countermeasures on aircraft; modifying flight operations and air traffic control procedures; improving airport and regional security; and strengthening missile non-proliferation efforts. Equipping aircraft with missile countermeasure systems can protect the aircraft even when operating in areas where ground-based security measures are unavailable or infeasible to implement. However, this option has a relatively high cost, between $1 million and $3 million per aircraft, and the time needed for implementation does not allow for immediate response to the existing terrorist threat. Procedural improvements such as specific flight crew training, altering air traffic procedures to minimize exposure to the threat, and improved security near airports may be less costly than countermeasures and could more immediately help deter domestic terrorist attacks. However, these techniques by themselves cannot completely mitigate the risk of domestic attacks and would not protect U.S. airliners flying to and from foreign airports.  Legislation introduced in the 108th Congress (H.R. 580, S. 311) calls for the installation of missile defense systems in all turbojet aircraft used in scheduled air carrier service. While this legislation is still under consideration, Homeland Security appropriations designated $60 million in FY2004 and $61 million in FY2005 to fund a program to develop and test prototype missile countermeasure systems for commercial aircraft based on existing military technology. It is anticipated that at the conclusion of this program, in January 2006, the Department of Homeland Security will be able to provide a detailed analysis of the suitability of such systems for use to protect commercial passenger aircraft.     .

   Europe Changing Their Tune?     Curt   2005-01-01T22:44:00  American Future has a link up to a article written in yesterdays Houston Chronicle. It describes how the European Governments look to be changing their tune in regards to President Bush. Why you ask? But there is arguably more to this sea change than just a grumpy acceptance of the status quo. From a European perspective, three things are making it easier to warm to the Bush White House.  One is the death of Yasser Arafat. No issue divides Europe and the United States more keenly than the Israeli-Palestinian dispute. For the last few years, Europeans have criticized Bush for failing to put enough pressure on Israel to get out of the occupied territories and for refusing to deal with Arafat. That another reason why I respect Bush so much, his refusal to acknowledge that windbag terrorist Arafat. May he rot in hell. But since Arafat's death, Europeans and Americans have been able to find common ground: supporting Ariel Sharon's withdrawal from Gaza, putting pressure on Israel to let the Palestinians hold elections and, covertly, backing Mahmoud Abbas to become the next Palestinian leader.  A second reason is Europe's growing worries about Islamic terrorism. The murder in November of Theo van Gogh, a provocative Dutch filmmaker, at the hands of an Islamic militant has been called Europe's 9/11. Though the two events are obviously not fully comparable, it is certainly true that American conservatives, such as Francis Fukuyama and Bernard Lewis, have found a wider audience recently for the idea that radical Islam is inimical to European traditions of tolerance. You mean those radical muslims can be kinda nasty sometimes? Get outta here....Keep doing business like the cowards in Spain and they will more then likely have their very own 9/11 to cry about. The third force is the reappearance, albeit in a milder form, of the threat that kept the trans-Atlantic alliance together for half a century. The Russian bear is growling again. The Ukrainian election --- complete with its KGB-style poisoning of the opposition leader and heavy-handed electoral fraud -- has reminded European diplomats of Vladimir V. Putin's determination to control his "near abroad." They should be very worried about this item, I believe Putin is slowly sliding Russia back to what it once was. Hopefully our Government isn't asleep at the wheel with this situation either. There is a personal edge to all this. Just as the snooty continentals eventually came to admire the gormless Hollywood actor, there is a grudging willingness to rethink some prejudices about the inarticulate Texan.  Many European leaders once swallowed the Michael Moore version of history: that Bush was an ignorant interloper who stole the White House. His thumping re-election, however, shows that he represents a large body of conservative American opinion.  In short, Europeans are getting used to the idea that it is not Bush who is the exception, but the U.S. itself that is exceptional --- and that if they want to deal with this exceptional superpower they need to humor it rather than rile it. Strangely enough, this has been Tony Blair's strategy all along; it is rapidly becoming the Continent's strategy, too. Couldn't of ended that article any better myself. Get used to it France, we ain't going nowhere.     .

   Liberal Reporter Taking Kickbacks     Curt   2005-02-03T19:53:00  Interesting article at the Accuracy In Media website yesterday. It seems a supposed straight shooting reporter with NBC was taking money to fund a book that is so pro-united nations that its almost sickening to read. (hat tip Clear and Present )  One of the hottest stories around, the U.N. corruption scandal, NBC has been out to lunch. Why? Its U.N. reporter has been on the payroll of the U.N. lobby. Linda Fasulo, the U.N. correspondent for NBC News and MSNBC, has written a pro-U.N. book, An Insider's Guide to the U.N. , which reads like the U.N. paid for it. Actually, the pro-U.N. lobby paid for it. In a monstrous conflict of interest for a supposed straight news reporter, Fasulo acknowledges Ted Turner's U.N. Foundation and Better World Campaign for "their generous financial support" of her book project. She also thanks the Rockefeller Brothers Fund "for helping to fund the project." The book is about "one of the finest and most important governing bodies," she says. Of the U.N. chief, she writes like a school girl with a crush. "It is hard to find anyone who can mount a serious criticism of [Kofi] Annan's performance as Secretary General," she claims. His performance is so "impressive" that she wonders if a "cult of personality" has risen up around him. One U.S. official is reported to be "astonished by just how good a Secretary General Kofi Annan has been." Yup, you read that right. Kofi's performance is soooooo impressive. Gag. Guess the democrats have their own Armstrong conspiracy to deal with.  Why would an NBC reporter (who also reports on the U.N. for National Public Radio) take money from the U.N. lobby? Perhaps because longtime NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw put his stamp of approval on the UNA-USA and BCUN by acting as master of ceremonies at their 2001 Global Leadership Dinner. Not surprisingly, Brokaw is listed on the Fasulo book jacket as saying it is a "must-read." Another endorsement of the book comes from Barbara Crossette, former New York Times bureau chief at the U.N. who now writes for U.N. Wire, a Ted Turner-funded online news service that covers the U.N. A fascinating part of the book is how Fasulo manages to gloss over Annan's role in the 1994 genocide in Rwanda. She tries to blame the U.S. and other members of the Security Council for not sending enough troops to stop it. She admits, however, that, "The Rwanda massacres occurred while Annan was U.N. Undersecretary General for peacekeeping," and that "After he became SG [Secretary General], Annan commissioned a report to examine what had happened and suggest remedies." Later, "Annan accepted responsibility for failing to act more quickly," she writes. But responsibility for what? The truth is that, as director of U.N. peacekeeping, Annan personally refused requests to authorize U.N. peacekeepers in Rwanda to seize weapons and prevent genocide. Writer and author Philip Gourevitch has described in detail how, three months before the genocide, Major General Romeo Dallaire, the commander of several thousand U.N. troops in Rwanda, sent a fax to Kofi Annan's office, saying he had received evidence from a Rwandan government informant that genocide was being planned. The informant offered to help U.N. forces in raiding the government stockpiles to be used in the genocide campaign. All that the informant wanted in return was protection for himself and his family. But the general needed U.N. authorization to conduct such a raid and save lives. He asked for that approval but the answer came back in a now-infamous "genocide fax" from Annan's office. It denied authorization for the mission and told him that he should turn the information provided by the confidential witness over to the Rwandan government which was planning the genocide! The result was that the information dried up and the genocide took place. Yup, good ole Kofi told this poor guy to give the secret info over to the very government that was planning the genocide. What a great guy he is isn't he.  Or how about the ongoing prostitution that's going on in the Congo?  Now the report comes out today on the Oil for Food scandal. Yeah...this guy is such a good SG. Eff him.  The article ends with the following:  In an April 30, 2001, Washington Times column, Nat Hentoff noted that the media have devoted "scant mention" to the "plain fact that it was Mr. Annan, when he was head of the United Nation's peacekeeping office, who could have prevented the slaughter of 800,000 Tutsis and their sympathizers in Rwanda in 1994." It's true, Hentoff said, that the U.N. issued a report in 1999 that acknowledged, to some extent, its role in the killings. But for five and a half years, he noted, Annan "refused to accept any responsibility for the Rwandan holocaust until Mr. Gourevitch and others revealed that less than 5,000 U.N. troops could have stopped the killings if Mr. Annan had not closed his eyes." It is astonishing that a journalist for NBC New would close her eyes to Annan's role. But that is what she was apparently paid to do.     .

   Mischie in jail   Nicolae Mischie, authoritarian leader of a district organization of the main opposition party, has been jailed.  Romania voted in the last December, ousting the so-called socialist party PSD (Social-Democratic Party). PSD managed to keep a stronghold in poor rural areas, with the help of people like Mischie. They combined blackmail, using their right of decision regarding the public funds for local leaders opposing PSD, and strong seduction of the uneducated masses, in a marvelous way. E.g., Mischie, who talks like an idiot, got a PhD in history. His paper was on a political personality of the 19th century and Mischie bought the house where his paper's subject lived. Maybe he tried to invest in his paper, maybe he believed sincerely in his admiration for the poor innocent dead guy and his ability of earning PhDs, but using a big car and living in a big house are signs for the masses that the man is an invaluable and irreplaceable leader. Another misleading sign was his position as a University professor - he was teaching mostly at private universities, which are still ways to buy diplomas here in Romania.  Local leaders did their jobs, but national leaders, pressuring TV stations to lie, associating with old communist ex-president Ion Iliescu, failed to win in big cities.  PSD is building a strategy for the 4 years to come and they are going to elect a leader. It is known that communist leaders die in office (as judges of the U.S. Supreme Court) and Ion Iliescu won't be different. All the leaders that expressed different points of view will be excluded from the party, that's the untold truth that Romanian media seem to hide or not conceive yet.  Mischie was right to criticize the national leaders, because PSD got a good share in the elections in his area. But Mischie was wrong, because he did that while in vacation in Switzerland, where you can't go if you earn 20K $ a year. The new power had nothing to do, but let the policemen do what they should be doing years ago.  Iliescu and Nastase, ex-president and ex-prime minister, are now left only with the leadership of the party and holding this illusory authority. If Mischie wouldn't take his chance on them, he would still be free, with the help of the weak and weakening strings Iliescu might still pull.    .

   Fallujah's 'Final Solution'?     zeyad   2004-11-08T19:42:06  The interim government declared a state of emergency in Iraq excluding the Kurdish region for 60 days, according to the National Security Law introduced last August which states that emergency laws can be declared in the country for a period no more than 60 days provided a serious threat against Iraqi national security is recognised by the interim government.  Obviously, this is a necessary step that should have been taken at least two months ago. Suicide bombings and guerrilla attacks carried out by insurgents and foreign terrorists based around Baghdad have escalated to alarming levels particularly during Ramadan.  Deputy governor of Diyala along with several council members from Ba'quba were ambushed and killed in Latifiya south of Baghdad, an area which has supposedly been 'cleared' from insurgents a couple of weeks ago. Four suicide attacks in Samarra, also a recently 'liberated' area, against National Guard units and the governorate building. Zarqawi's group claimed responsibility for the attacks.  Three police stations in Haditha, a small town west of Ramadi, were assaulted by groups of insurgents. Some 30 policemen were captured, tied up and executed in cold blood against the walls following a confrontation which lasted two hours. Zarqawi's group, again, claiming responsibility.  A full-scale military operation against Fallujah, which is apparently underway already, seems to be the government's 'final solution'. I'm not optimistic to the outcome, especially when significant civilian casualties are unavoidable.  Note, that I'm not suggesting a peaceful or political solution would work either in these areas. Insurgents west of Baghdad have quite obstinately made it clear that nothing but full control of the country, or at least the Anbar governorate, will satisfy them. They have refused to participate in the political process, they have repeatedly announced their intentions to boycott the elections and to disrupt them in other areas, and they do not recognise the government or any other authority in the country beside themselves.  The demands of the Fallujah negotiants from the government weeks ago were obscene and they clearly reflect the overt sectarianism and regionalism of the armed groups in the area. The demands were not released to the Iraqi public at the time for unkown reasons but they have leaked out days ago. Here are just a few of them:  -A clear timetable for the withdrawal of foreign occupation forces (fair enough).  -Immediate withdrawal of US and Iraqi security forces from the Anbar governorate and the handover of security responsibilities to former army officers from Anbar.  -The appointment of ministers from the Anbar governorate to the ministries of Interior, Defense, Oil and Finance.  -The removal of certain officials (most of them from Shi'ite Islamic parties such as Ibrahim Al-Ja'fari) from governmental positions.  -The complete return of Ba'athists, army officers, Republican Guards, Mukhabarat, intelligence and security personnel to their former positions.  -The removal of Shi'ite Edhan (call for prayers) from official television and radio programs.  -Incomes of Shi'ite sacred shrines should be returned under the control of the Ministry of Endowments and Religious Affairs.  These last two demands have been allegedly added by Sheikh Harith Al-Dhari (head of the Association of Muslim Scholars) and are said to have been a major reason behind the failure of negotiations with the government.  Iraqis here in the south were shocked to hear of these demands and sectarian tensions are on the rise. It scares me to see the reaction of people around me whenever Fallujah is mentioned. The director of a primary health care clinic was remarking the other day that "Fallujah should be burnt upon its residents and then razed to the ground. They are the sons of Mu'awiya, may Allah curse them all." Sidenote: Mu'awiya bin Abi Sufyan was the governor of Syria during the 7th century and he fought Imam Ali bin Abi Talib (Muhammed's son-in-law) over the Caliphate after the assassination of Caliph Othman. He became the first Ummayid Caliph and two decades later, under the Caliphate of his son Yazid, Imam Hussein bin Ali (grandson of Muhammed) was killed by his armies at present day Karbala. Someone hushed the director and pointed out to him that I'm Sunni. He was a bit embarrassed and tried to explain that he was referring to Wahhabis and foreign fighters. It was a bit uncomfortable and I could feel that people were giving me furtive glances.  Refugees have been pouring out of Fallujah over the last few days into Baghdad and the surrounding areas. The military operation will undoubtly aggravate the humanitarian situation inside the city since there are definitely thousands of families with no place to go. Refugees in Baghdad have confirmed the rumours that the 'Mujahideen' are forcing men from 15-50 years old to stay and that they were threatened with execution if they refuse to carry arms in defense of the town. Majlis Shura Al-Mujahideen (The Mujahideen Advisory Council) are in control of Fallujah and they have distributed a statement inviting Arab and foreign (including American) media reporters to enter the town and cover the battles. The statement carried the insignia of Zarqawi's group Qa'idat Al-Jihad .  Everyone is closely watching what the next few days will bring, hoping the violence doesn't spread to the streets of Baghdad or other areas. I'm still holed up in Basrah but I'll try to be on the road as soon as possible.     .

   Daylight Savings Time is retarded     Mark Backer   2004-11-03T13:00:00  I am 36 years old. I've been around a while. I'm not 87 or anything, but I've seen some things in my life. I have initially agreed and disagreed with different things over the years, only to have my mind changed later. However, I will never EVER change my mind about the idiocy we call Daylight Savings Time.  I Googled "Daylight Savings Time" and I got the following link:  http://webexhibits.org/daylightsaving/  I started reading...  The site says things like "We've learned to save energy and enjoy sunny summer evenings by switching our clocks an hour forward in the summer" and there's no S at the end of Savings. It should be Daylight Saving Time.  My apologies to the assclowns that invented this idiocy and the goobers that perpetuate it in such a ridiculous fashion.  I will concede that "springing forward" and "falling back" are good ways to remember to change the batteries in your smoke detectors. However, New Years and the Fourth of July would do the same thing.  I kept reading the website of propoganda and found that the first person to come up with the idea was Benjamin Franklin who did it on behalf of some friends that owned oil companies (oil was used in lamps).  I assume that, because the idea was dumb and inconvenient, lots of people ignored it. "By 1966, some 100 million Americans were observing DST based on their own local laws and customs. Congress decided to step in to end the confusion and establish one pattern across the country. The Uniform Time Act of 1966 (15 U.S. Code Section 260a) which was signed into Public Law 89-387 on 12 April 1966, by President Lyndon Johnson, created Daylight Saving Tim to begin on the last Sunday of April and to end on the last Sunday of October. Any State that wanted to be exempt from DST could do so by passing a state law.  There's a LOT more to this since then, and you can read a lot more it if you want to, but this is what I know:  Indiana's eastern half doesn't use it. What's THAT all about?  Arizona doesn't use it because one tribe of Indians stretches into three states. But those other states DO use it.  Hawaii doesn't use it at all. Of course, they're closer to Japan than to us, and since Japan doesn't use it, Hawaii just plays along. (Do you think the Hawaiian's sit around, staring west, just becuase they still don't trust the Japs?)  Regardless of when I go to bed (11pm or 10pm or 9pm), I get up at 5:30 and I am fucking exhausted. How can that be? I slept the same number of hours as I did two weeks ago, yet I'm tired?  Also, I am so hungry I could eat my little tub of Carmex by 10:30am every day. I used to eat lunch between 11:30 and noon, but now, eating is all I think about after 10am. Why is that good for me?  I don't care if America saves 1% of its energy consumption costs during those times. I am tired, hungry, and I leave for work and get home from work in the dark. How healthy is that?  For that matter, I don't care about any of the pro-farming or anti-crime propoganda. Daylight SAVINGS Time sucks!!  Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go stalk the lobby for the girls that are bringing me my Krystals. order and fight to keep myself from falling asleep in my cube.    Amy   ????-??-??T15:39:00  About time you realized Daylight SavingS time is the work of Satan's minions.    Jassalasca Jape   ????-??-??T20:18:00  You would feel comfortable in China, then; it's the same time everywhere.    .

   And so it's come down to this...     Mark Backer   2004-11-08T15:07:00  It's Auburn-Georgia week, ladies and gentlemen. After all the smack talk that's gone on for the last 360 days, and all of the games that both teams have played and the hopes each had for the 2004 season, it's come down to this.  To stay undefeated and alive for a chance at the BCS title game, Auburn must win this Saturday in it's 3:30 EST game on CBS against the Georgia Bulldogs.  If they hope to move up from their current number five ranking and keep the hope alive of playing in the SEC Title Game in December, Georgia must beat Auburn.  This game is as good as it gets. Sure, Auburn's in-state rival is Alabama, but year in and year out, this game, the Auburn-UGA game, seems like the one that matters more. I seldom if ever root for Bama, but I always root for UGA to be undefeated when the play Auburn. The game is big enough already, but it seems even bigger when one or both teams have something on the line.  Yes, both teams have other games left to play and yes, other teams' results may affect what happens to both of these teams, but in just five days, these two teams will play the biggest and most important game of their season.  So now it's time for all of the yapping and jawing and talking shit that goes with this game.  Except I don't do that. I can't do that. Anytime I try to talk shit, I get all nauseous and worry about what happens not if but WHEN we lose. I don't know if it's just me or if being this pragmatic is what it means to be an Auburn fan. I wonder if deep down THIS is what it feels like to be a Red Sox fan: regardless of where you are or what is happening to your team, deep down you don't just think, you KNOW something bad is going to happen.  Anyway, I am flying my flag on my house with pride and I am looking forward to the game that, year in and year out, gives us the best hitting and mos entertaining football played on the highest level. It's SEC football at it's core.  War Eagle.    Anonymous   ????-??-??T12:00:00  balls    .

   Blurble...     Mark Backer   2004-11-12T07:07:00  It's now just one day until I hop in the car and head back in time to the loveliest village on the Plains...Auburn, Alabama.  I haven't been back since 1994 and when I was talking to my wife about the trip this morning, it seems like a lifetime ago. Hell, it's been half my life since I was in school there and over two thirds of my adult life, assuming that people that know me think my adult life has actually started yet.  Anyway, enough nostalgia from me, at least for now.  The wife and I were watching SportsCenter this morning, and Lee Corso, Mark May and Trev Alberts were ALL picking Auburn to beat Georgia, and the last two were picking them to run the table for the right to play USC for the national championship.  Blurble....  Then, I open the Atlanta paper this morning, and EVERYTHING is pro-UGA. I mean, I knew it would be, but some of it was even based on facts.  Like this beauty: When Auburn and their opponent are both in the top ten, Auburn is 4-6-1 in those games. Auburn has lost the last three games that fit that scenario.  Blurble....  Auburn's last defeat came at the hands of...UGA.  Blurble...  Auburn does lead the overall record in the series 51-46-8. However, the road team's record in this series. AT Auburn, UGA is 11-8-2. At Athens, Auburn is 17-8. This trend was serious in the 80's, with the road team winning about two-thirds of the time. The only time this changed recently really was when UGA decided to win in their place in 2003. Thanks Dawgs.  Blurble...  On the upside, Auburn has scored at least 33 points in the last six games. That's a pretty nice run.  Auburn leads the SEC in scoring offense, scoring defense and rushing defense.  Auburn is second in the nation in scoring defense and seventh in pass defense.  Jason Campbell is 3rd in the nation in passing efficiency while David Greene is 10th.  Here are a couple of middle of the road stats:  Auburn's Quentin Groves and Georgia's David Pollack are tied for the SEC sack lead.  Here's the biggest for what it's worth stat as far as I am concerned: both teams are undefeated this year when scoring first. Auburn is 8-0 and UGA is 5-0. I'd say that's the biggest stat right now.  Auburn's offense is potent and efficient. UGA's defense is relentless and contains a couple of the country's biggest hitters, especially Greg Blue and Odell Thurman.  Auburn's defense is fast and relentless and the DB's are experienced and big. UGA's receivers are leaders, with one of them a team captain.  Auburn's two running backs are seniors and very experienced and dangerous, bruising backs. UGA's two backs are smaller freshmen with less experience, but are dangerous as well.  In my mind, the game is going to turn on a few key points, some obvious and some not. Here goes the prediction machine:  - Turnovers (as always) will be critical.  - Special teams play and lack of special teams mistakes will tell the tale regarding field position.  - Both teams MUST establish the run to be successful. If Auburn goes for 150 between their two backs, they're almost impossible to beat. Conversely, Georgia MUST be able to run the ball to set up play action and keep the pressure off of David Greene.  - Mark Richt has proven to be a better on the fly adjustment coach that Tommy Tuberville. Tubs is famous for taking chances, often unnecessary ones. That history is of concern to me. While it's okay to try crazy shit when your team is under-rated or a serious underdog, it's important not to give games away when you're the favorite. Playing more "by the book" and a bit "closer to the vest" becomes the call for the day.  Considering all of these factors, I truly believe that this is Auburn's year. They may not go undefeated and they may not get into the BCS title game, but they have enough talent, poise and experience to win this game.  Auburn wins 31-21.  And now that I have typed that prediction, I may just throw up in my mouth.  War...Blurble...Eagle!!  Added at 1:28pm on 11/12/04  Ack!!  David Greene is the winningest QB in NCAA division I history!! AND he's 15-1 on the road!!  15-1 on the road???  UGA wins 24-21  Blurble.    .

   Putting the cart before the horse...     Mark Backer   2004-11-17T07:23:00  You know, for the past five days and really for about the past fifteen or twenty days, I've been angry about the BCS rankings and why Auburn isn't ranked higher and all of that business. Can someone tell me why one of my friends or family members hasn't smacked me because of it?  I mean, here we are, 10-0 and staring down the barrell of a road game AT Tuscaloosa against our hated rivals, the Alabama Crimson Tide, and I'm bitching about how we better get to play for a national title? Really?  You don't have to think back too far to find a similar scenario, only with the shoe firmly on the other foot.  In 1989, Alabama was 10-0, number two in the nation and coming into Auburn for the first time ever to play at Jordan-Hare Stadium. All the talk for the weeks leading up to the game was about "if Bama's undefeated, they'll play for it all in the Sugar Bowl" and other crap like that.  Well, "if or when" never happened because Auburn won 30-20 in one of the greatest Iron Bowl games ever, putting an end to Bama's national title hopes for the year.  15 years later, the situation's reversed. It's Auburn that's undefeated and facing the road game at the end of the season.  Suddenly, I'm about nauseous about this game too. Despite being riddled with injuries, Alabama has a ridiculously stout defense, recently ranked as the number one defense in the country.  Egad. Has all of the bluster and talking shown up on The Plains as well? I only hope that Coach Tuberville has been successful at keeping his players focused, motivated and thinking about ONLY the Alabama game.    .

   Do people never learn from the mistakes of others?     Mark Backer   2004-11-17T11:07:00  For those of you not from around these parts, Linda Schrenko WAS the State of Georgia's Superintendant of schools. It seems that in recent years, instead of doing the people's business, good ole Linda has spent her time stealing over 600 grand in Federal Education funds. She used it for various things, but the favorite is the nine grand she spent on a facelift.  Here's a link to the story:  link  One thing that made me laugh is that she showed up at her indictment in a fur coat.  Ummm, am I the only one that learned anything from the Michael Irvin drug trial of the mid 90's? You never EVER show up at court, especially facing indictment for stealing large sums of money, wearing a fucking FUR COAT!! Fake or not, you look like you're rubbing the common man's nose in it.  Schrenko is a scumbag and, although she won't get any actual jail stole. Otherwise, she's learned nothing.  Remember when Michael Milken got busted, he was not forced to give up his secret accounts, and when the fine of 600 million was levied...HE PAID IT!! Hell, at his zenith, that's what he made in ONE YEAR!!  "Um...how much, your honor? 600 large? Yeah, lemme just get my checkbook out of my diamond encrusted briefcase."  Schrenko stole 20 times what Martha Stewart did, and I bet she won't see the wrong side of a jail cell door, and that's sad. Because it's people like Schrenko for which jails were specifically designed...    .

   1 day to glory...     Mark Backer   2004-11-19T10:02:00  Well, it's mid-morning on the East coast and I am sitting here running numbers thru my head trying to figure out what's going to happen in the Iron Bowl, which is just over 29 hours away.  The game is being played in Tuscaloosa, which should be an advantage to Alabama. However, In the two times the game has been played in Bryant Denny Stadium, Auburn has won.  Alabama has one of the stingiest defenses in the country, and were ranked number one in overall defense as recently as last week. Conversely, Auburn has one of the most potent and balanced offensive attacks in the nation. Also, I don't think Bama has faced an attack with two great runners, a great line, a poised QB and good receivers and a tight end as well.  Bama is missing it's starting offensive backfield from the start of the season. The fact that they've won six games is a testament to the coaching and heart of the players.  Alabama simply cannot throw the football, which is a good thing, because Auburn's defensive backfield is second to none. Bama can run the ball however. Unfortunately for them, with no passing game to keep the defense honest, Auburn will probably stack nine in the box, play man on the corners, and dare Bama to run, and I don't think they'll be able to do it.  Auburn is also 9-0 when they score first. The Tuberville way is to get one quick and early to get your crowd into it if you're at home and to quiet the other team's crowd if you're on the road.  You can never tell what is going to happen in rivalry games. In this exact game 15 years ago, Bama came into Auburn #2 in the country, undefeated at 10-0 and looking for yet another national championship. They were summarily trounced 30-20 in a game in which the score was closer than the actual game. That could very well happen Saturday.  I always tell people that the Georgia game matters more to me than the Bama game. I live in Georgia, and losing that game affects me much more directly than losing the Alabama game. That said, when kickoff time comes, you remember all the reasons that you hate Alabama and their dumbass haircuts and their detergent and toilet paper and their houndstooth hats and their "Bear this" and "Bear that," and everything else that goes along with it. This isn't a football game, and it's not two drunken cousins fighting at a family reunion. This is brother against brother after one slept with the other's wife and then bragged about it. It's THAT serious.  However, when it's all said and done, I just don't think Alabama has the horses to stand up to what I believe is going to be enormous defensive pressure. If Auburn takes care of the ball and executes, this game shouldn't be as close as some think.  My call:  Auburn 37  Alabama 13  Now pass the Tums. I don't feel so well...  War Eagle!!    .

   There's not "holiday" in this Holiday weekend...     Mark Backer   2004-11-28T16:41:00  We have been on the go since about noon on Wednesday and even longer in the wife's case. She started cleaning about a week before the holiday and cleaned for about two weeks right thru the holiday.  We spent Friday doing a little shopping and got to bed early, but Saturday was busy with football watching. The Irish suck. Not as a people, but as a football team. The looked good for 15 minutes, but then they got run over by Matt Leinert and USC. I have no beef with USC being number one, but Oklahoma is nowhere close to number two in the country, and I am sick of the pollsters who only look at East coast scores instead of watching tape of the games. Auburn has trailed in exactly two games this year, and has given up less than 9.5 points per game. Oklahoma has given up bucketloads of points, but still gets some mystery respect for it.  (I know many of you may be tired of my rants about this, have no fear. It'll all be over by next Sunday night or Monday morning. At that point, we're either in or fucked and either way, I'm writing about it once then, and that will be it).  Anyway, we decided to go ahead and get a fake tree yesterday, and we got that bad boy put up yesterday and are decorating it today. We also got all of our exterior lights up today, marking the first time this family has ever had their decorating done by Thanksgiving Sunday. Big kudos to the missus.  It feels weird not watching racing today, but it'll get easier and then, come January 10th or so, there'll be testing news and driver signing news and we'll be on the back side of the remaining 84 days until the Daytona 500.  Until tomorrow kids, WAR EAGLE!!    .

   Somebody alert the media!!!     Mark Backer   2004-12-02T07:11:00  Apparently Jason Giambi, recently the non-playing and "sick" first baseman of the New York Yankees, admitted to a Grand Jury that he "injected anabolic steroids and human growth hormone (HGH) as recently as 2003. And he apparently got them thru BALCO and (surprise) the same guy that is Barry Bonds' trainer, once Greg Anderson.  Since that Grand Jury testimony was given, Giambi repeatedly denied using any steroids, HGH, or anything else to anyone and everyone that would listen.  Jason's brother Jeremy also admitted to the grand jury that he used steroids.  Now, Barry is denying he's done any steroids and Gary Sheffield's denying he's done any steroids, but one by one, the lesser (and bigger) players in this deal are seeing their testimony coming into the the public eye where they admitted that they DID do steroids. It seems that anyone associated with this special "trainer" Greg Anderson is coming up dirty.  It's a good thing that Major League Baseball has such a tough steroid policy, or this story may not have been brought to our attention. (cough...cough...sarcasm...cough).  Never mind if the steroids and human growth hormones were illegal in baseball or not. They are illegal to use in the United States. I want to know where the Federal criminal charges against all parties involved are. Anyone?  The fact that these guys (Sheff, the Giambis, Marion Jones, Bonds and many others) are running around denying this shit and acting like Pete Rose did any time someone asked him about gambling (getting uber defensive, denying it implicitly and acting like the person asking had personally assaulted him) is appalling. These clowns are messing with people's careers by insisting they're being lied about, yet when it turns out the reporters weren't lying and the athletes were, nothing is done.  I have never denied that Barry Bonds was a special and gifted athlete. Whether it's steroids, HGH, crank, lighter fluid or antifreeze he's using, being able to perform at this level for this length of time defies logic or reason. That's why it's a shame that, in the final analysis, all of Bonds' numbers and accomplishments are going to be ignored and lumped into the statement "yeah, but he was on steroids." It's a pity he and the others are too dumb to see that.  And now, just so you don't think that every entry in this blog will be like the one above, here's a great joke I read today:  A man takes his Rottweiler to the vet and says, "My dog's cross-eyed, is there anything you can do for him? "  "Well," says the vet, "let's have a look at him."  So he picks the dog up and examines his eyes, then checks his teeth.  Finally, the vet says "I'm going to have to put him down."  "What? Because he's cross-eyed?"  "No, because he's really heavy."  I will be breaking down the SEC championship game either later today or tomorrow, so I expect you all to be planted firmly on the edge of your seats waiting for that one.  War Eagle everybody!    .

   Hey, look who got screwed...     Mark Backer   2004-12-06T07:33:00  I am having a difficult time putting my feelings into words right now, so bear with me.  First of all, I want to congratulate the Auburn Football team for doing what no other Auburn football team has done; going 12-0. They also won their first outright SEC title since 1987 and won their first SEC title since the conference implimented the Championship game format.  A year ago, the program was in disarray and the coach was one poorly executed plane trip away from being fired by an over-zealous and too empowered booster with a fat checkbook. Since that day, the team is undefeated and has won 14 games in a row. They have now beated four teams that were in the top 15 at the time the games were played, and two of those games were won away from Jordan-Hare Stadium.  On championship weekend, the big three all played. USC won by five over a shitty UCLA team with a 6-5 record, and that was thanks in part to an official who blew dead a clear and obvious fumble that would have been returned for a UCLA touchdown.  Oklahoma played in it's conference title game against a four-loss Colorado team that can't throw the ball. The result was a 40 plus point beatdown, but what did anyone expect?  Auburn played 15th ranked Tennessee and was attempting to do one of the toughest things to do in college football: beating a team twice in the same year.  With the exception of a 15 yard shanked punt and a punt snap that Kody Bliss missed while having an apparent thrombosis, Auburn led 21-7 at the half and had held UT to 46 yards of offense. While the Auburn running game was held up, Jason Campbell threw it all over the ball field and, when his receivers were covered, he ran for yardage on his own. This despite several late hits to the head, low hits at his knees and ankles, and various other assaults outside the realm of good sportsmanship.  Tennessee scored on a pass play that was incorrectly ruled a touchdown, since the ball clearly touched the turf, and that's where the momentum of the game changed. I think it was also at that point that the scoreboard began to reflect Auburn's last title hopes dying as the Oklahoma-Colorado score would have begun showing the beat-down that was occuring.  Auburn was tied 21-21 and in jeapordy of losing it most important game ever, but senior QB Jason Campbell would have none of it.  Auburn won going away 38-28, and the only place the game looked close was on the scoreboard.  I can't believe that an undefeated SEC team is not playing for a title, but I guess we can thank Jeff Sagarin and the other dicks that keep voting USC number one to make up for what happened to them last year. All I know is that they better think that way next year, because it's Auburn that got screwed this year.  And what's better is that Auburn gets to play one of the three hottest teams in the country in my opinion. Virginia Tech is talented, very athletic and one of the most well coached teams in the country and they WILL come to play on January 3rd.  I hope our kids can shake off this travesty and focus on making the pollsters look like idiots. Maybe an Oklahoma win in a butt-ugly game and a great Auburn performance could help.  What's the definition of pragmatic? Going undefeated and chanting "We're number TWO!!"  War Eagle    .

   It ain't much...     Mark Backer   2004-12-17T16:39:00  Sorry I haven't been posting much lately. We have been so damned busy with the holidays (that's what we call December at our house) that I just haven't had time.  I read a funny joke today and I thought I'd share it with you. One of my fellow eggers posted it, so Chet, here's your credit:  A traveler was driving through Arkansas when he lost his way and got off the main highway. As he drove by, he saw rows and rows of pigsties and pigpens and pigs running in fields and pigs wallowing in mud. Suddenly, his eye caught something really strange. He did a double take, muttered to himself and then looked a third time. He wondered if he had seen correctly - it looked like a pig with a wooden leg! He found the lane to the farm and drove up into the farmyard, where he was met by the farmer. "Excuse me," the traveler said. "I was just driving by and looking at all your pigs, and I noticed something that I just had to stop and ask about. Tell me, did I see right? Is there really a pig out there with a wooden leg?" The farmer smiled. "Oh, that would be old Caesar you saw. He's the finest pig a man could ever hope to have - and smart! Well, let me tell you a little about that pig. You see that barge down there on the river? That's a mining dredge, taking out platinum ore. Old Caesar sniffed out the vein and showed us how to set it up. Now that dredge brings me in about $120,000 every year. "There's another thing, too, a little more personal. One night a couple of years ago I got to drinking and I guess I had more than I should have. I passed out drunk, fell down and knocked over a lamp. That started a fire in the house and old Caesar smelled the smoke. He came in the back door, got the wife and kid out, roused me up and got me out. "There is no question about it - that night old Caesar saved all our lives and you know that is not the sort of thing a man is going to forget too easily." "Why," the traveler said, "this is all amazing! I have never heard of a pig like this before! This is fantastic! But tell me, how did he get that wooden leg? Was he in a wreck or something?" The farmer laughed and said, "Well, naturally, when you have a pig that smart, you don't want to eat him all at one time!"    .

   Did anyone see the Packers game Sunday?     Mark Backer   2004-12-20T09:19:00  While it was entertaining, that's not why I'm posting about it. I don't normally post about pro football, but what I saw deserved a ranting or two, and I suspect it's going to get many more in the days and weeks to come.  With 4:41 left in the fourth quarter and the Packers down by 11, Favre hit Robert Ferguson with a 31 yard strike near the left hash marks. Coming from the other direction, Jacksonville DB Donovin Darius unloaded chin high on Ferguson with a vicious clothesline. Remarkably, Ferguson held on to the ball, despite being disjoined from his helmet on the hit. After many minutes lying motionless on the field, Ferguson was finally removed via stretcher, giving a thumbs up to the crowd on the way out.  The Packers went on to lose the game, but that's not the story here.  This was not one of the staged stiff-armed clotheslines you see in professional wrestling broadcasts. This was a vicious, arm cocked and swinging clothesline that literally could have torn Ferguson's head off of his body.  The play was immediately flagged, and moments later it was announced that Darius had been ejected, much to the crowd's delight.  One sidenote here is that, despite their rabid fandom and the situation, not one thing was thrown at the offending player as he left the field. It would have been easy to bathe him in beer or snowballs or batteries as he left, but the Packer fans are classier than that. To a person, they acted with class, using their voices and not projectiles to express their displeasure.  This was the most vicious and blatantly dirty play I have seen in the NFL since Jim McMahon was body slammed to the ground in the mid 80's about five seconds after he had released a pass. And Jaguars coach Jack Del Rio and Darius had the nerve to vociferously argue with officials about Darius' ejection from the game.  I don't care what anyone says about "you can't judge intent." Darius' intent was to dismember, injure or even kill Ferguson. The more I saw the replay, the sicker it made me feel.  The league must take action, and it must be swift and sure. I'm talking about a four game suspension that included the playoffs if necessary.  In this day and age of bigger, stronger and faster players, injuries are going to happen accidentally all of the time. There is simply no room for the kind of play that resulted in Ferguson's injury. Paul Tagliabue must give word to all of his employees that actions like this will not be tolerated.  Maybe that will tell the Jaguars, Darius and players like him that this kind of head-hunting will not be tolerated in the NFL.  If not, I fully expect the Packers and many other teams to handle this matter "on the field" with Darius being the target of similar attacks by tight ends and offensive lineman.    .

   I forgot to tell you this...     Mark Backer   2005-01-03T08:29:00  I was on vacation from December 23rd until today, January 3rd. It's tough to come back to work after being gone for ten days, but I think it's tougher to stay home and try to do what my wife does every day, which is work, raise our daughter, keep the house, cook, and everything else.  Thanks for everything babe.  Now, the thing I forgot to tell you was that when I walked out of the office to go home on the 23rd, there was a pink post it on my car. It said:  "Hi! I scraped your bumper. Sorry! : (  Call me Joyce _ _ _ _ _ _ _  770-239-X X X X  12/23/04  Really. Including the sad face.  I am happy she left the note and took responsibility for it, but what in the fuck is going on that every couple of months I'm taking cars to the shop for things that are not my fault? This is the third incident in 15 months, and two of the three involved other folks hitting my parked cars!! I knew my 20 year clean record would end sometime, but do the karma Gods have to beat me over the head with a shovel about it?  So today I had Enterprise pick me up at 7:15, which was great. I was worried about being late to work and, as it turned out, I was only 16 minutes late.  I was given a choice between a taurus and an impala. I took the impala. I made the wrong choice. It drives like shit. So much for my GM loyalty. They make great trucks and SUV's, but their sedans suck ass.  I will return this piece of shit on Friday, only to rent another vehicle Monday morning while we take the wife's car to the shop to get her 1400 bucks worth of damage repaired.  I actually don't know if it will be Monday yet, as I didn' twant to ruin Joyce's New Year by giving her the bad news. I plan to call her this morning and tell her the total, complete with my rental car for a week. I'll let you know how it goes.  Happy New Year. Peace on earth. Goodwill towards all men, and keep away from my fucking vehicles!!    .

   We're Number 2!!!!     Mark Backer   2005-01-05T15:26:00  The college football season is finally over. On one hand, I am a bit sad because years like this only happen for Auburn every 15 or 20 years, so it's a little disappointing.  On the other hand, this worked out about as well as it could. If you asked me at the beginning of the year if I'd rather be 8-3 and playing in the liberty bowl or 12-0 with a chance to win the Sugar Bowl, go 13-0 and finish second, I'd say hell yeah to the latter.  The fact that pundits put OU ahead of Auburn based on their out of conference schedule being tougher than ours is laughable now. In the end, playing Bowling Green over us playing The Citadel didn't make the Sooners much better. Man, I've seen softer takedowns on Cops. USC came on to the field, gave up a TD, then decided to make Choke-lahoma their collective bitches, and they did just that.  38-10 at the half meant that I didn't even have to hear that dying hyena Ashlee "no, I'm the one with dark hair and no boobs" Simpson butcher yet another song on tv. Hell, I read it on Fark this morning. Hooray for big first half beatings that get me an extra hour of sleep.  We might not have won, but we wouldn't have let Leinert go long on us all night either. Our db's would have had something to say about that. And, it turns out that when playing a decent team, OU can't do shit on offense. That was just plain terrible. Jason White looked like Jason Voorhees out there, stomping around getting caught from every direction any time he didn't hand of to Peterson for a three yard loss.  In five years, Oklahoma has played in four huge games, and lost three of them...badly. That must feel like being a Sox fan before this year, I'd imagine.  Anyway, I feel great. Think about this. A year ago, Tuberville was one reporter's abililty to find an out of place airplane in Ohio away from being fired BEFORE the Alabama game. Then, the AD and President get canned, a booster starts down the long road to shun-ville, and Tuberville keeps smiling and saying the right things.  He talks his two running backs and two stellar DB's into staying, then knocks out 15 straight wins and signs one of those super iron-clad contracts that will pay him 14 million over seven years, and if Auburn even thinks...THINKS about letting him go, they owe him every penny. I don't even think there's a morality clause. He could have sex with an endangered Bald Eagle, and they'd STILL have to pay him. And that's the way it should be.  Meanwhile, Auburn fans can spend the next six months saying "yeah, but we'd have done this" or "We were 13-0, won the sec, beat five top ten teams, three of them on the road, and became the only undefeated SEC team in the BCS's history to NOT play for the title." And coincidentally, Oklahoma's played in it this year, last year, and in 2000. You won in 2000, but you got punked the last two years, and last year you got to play for the title even though you didn't even win your conference. You got embarassed by Kansas State and LSU last year, and humiliated this year. But the little 12 is SOOO much better than the SEC. That's why you played a four-loss team for your conference title this year. And, considering the BCS is run by the head of the Big 12, it's no wonder you get the benefit of the doubt.  Don't think so? How about the fact that only two teams that didn't win their conference have ever played for the national title? You and Nebraska in 2001. Oh, the other thing you two Big 12 teams have in common is that you got your asses kicked on the sport's biggest stage.  So yes, we are disappointed. But all you can do is play the schedule in front of you. Auburn did that with class and dignity, they won every game, faced down every challenge, and made every Auburn fan in the country and the world proud.  War Eagle!!  Now, can someone get the Auburn cheerleaders some of those USC sweaters? Meow!    .

   Who saw this coming?     Mark Backer   2005-01-05T16:32:00  Much like the "I told you so's" everyone is throwing at the UGA basketball program after their hiring and subsequent firing of The Harricks, folks around the Buckeye state have to be having similar thoughts.  It seems that AD and frequent "No we didn't" Ohio State front man Andy Geiger is "retiring" after 11 years at the helm.  Maybe it's me, but I'm guessing Andy's tired of putting on TV makeup and going on the news lying about what he or Tressel knew about their athletes in general and their football program in particular. It seems that Maurice Clarrett-gate just isn't going away.  Two years ago, everyone was saying "shame on you, Maurice. You should have known better." Now, it seems like most folks are saying "Shame on you both Andy and Jim. YOU both should have know better."  Allegations have come to light that several OSU players received illegal benefits including cash, access to cars, etc. Now, I don't expect the AD and coach to know everything, but when a player is driving a brand new car every couple of weeks or months, well, somebody ought to jot a memo and get to the bottom of that.  It shouldn't surprise Buckeye fans either, since Tressel had similar problems at Youngstown State, and left a wake of controversy behind himself there as well, including (surprise) illegal benefits including cash, cars, grade fixing, etc.  Geiger is also tired from saying "we didn't do anything wrong" about his basketball program. Of course, it was discovered that his men's basketball coach had directly given six grand to a Yugoslavian recruit, but that was just his stipend for travel and coach Jim O'Brien was just having a problem with the currency exchange rates...right Andy?  I only hope that the NCAA will do something they rarely do: make a good sound decision and take away Ohio State's national title from January 2003. It seems they had a very important and very ineligible player that season, and maybe many. I'd hate to give another title to Thugtown Miami, but I'd give it to Alabama before I'd think it was okay for Ohio State to keep.    .

   If a tree fell in a Cadadian forest...     Mark Backer   2005-02-17T06:47:00  would it make a noise and if it did, would anyone south of Boston give a shit?  Wednesday, Commissioner Gary Bettman announced the cancellation of the 2004-2005 NHL season. As if everyone didn't already know that was the case.  Shame on the NHL and shame on the players' association for not getting a deal done, but I put much more of the blame on the owners as this "negotiation" came down to the wire.  I understand that the league was losing less money by not playing than it would have by having a season this year. I also understand that when push came to shove, the players gave in and accepted a salary cap. Okay, the sides were about 7 million per team apart, but couldn't they just say "alright, let's split that in half and play hockey?"  I mean Holy Christ people, two kids arguing over 10 bucks would work it out that way. Why is this any different? The NHL's primary goal was to get a salary cap approved by the players, and they finally did. And what did the NHL do when that momentus event occurred?  They left the negotiating table.  Gary Bettman is a mindless troll and the professional sports commissioner equivalent of Joe Hazelwood and this lockout / strike / cluster fuck is the reef.  The first thing that needs to happen is that Bettman and Goodenow (the players' association rep) need to be fired, deported, flogged, tarred and feathered and finally forced to pay for four tickets plus a program, four dogs, four beers, and two cokes and parking to a game at an NHL arena for every day of the next season so they understand what the fans go thru to see a hockey game.  Then, all current contracts need to be voided by the end of the season in 2006. That means no team would own any player, and the owners would be free to sign whomever they'd like using the "fiscal restraint" they all droned on and on about all year. That way, they'd only pay as much as they could afford...right?  Wrong.  Those douchebags would end up overspending like every professional sports owner because they can't control themselves. If Mr. Iginla or Heatley were free agents, for example, owners would bid each other out of their minds, then they'd be left with not enough to get a competetive team.  While the business model in the NHL was certainly flawed and the owners needed help, they really needed help to protect them from themselves. And the fact is that without that help, the owners would follow the same path that got them where they are right now anyway.  The biggest issue is this, however. Very few people give one hot shit whether the NHL plays another game ever, let alone this season or the next one. For every crying Canuck there are 1,000 or more others who say "No hockey? Huh...didn't even notice."  And the last television network interested in carrying hockey (ESPN) may opt out of televising the NHL next season, meaning that all of the teams would be in HUGE trouble, because no TV = no league. Period. Atlanta lost the Flames 25 years ago because, despite full houses every night, it's TV revenue that pays the freight and the Flames had no tv contract. Imagine an entire league with no TV contract. Hell, Major League Soccer and the WNBA DO have a tv contract and no one gives a shit about them.  I'll say this for the NHL, when they screw up, they screw up huge.  Congrats guys. You will forever be known as the generation that killed professional hockey in North America. That'll look GREAT on your resumes.    .

   Martha Stewart: Last Day of the "Living" Dead     Byrne   2004-12-09T14:01:00  Shares of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia , a company whose name is so breathtakingly self-promoting it makes me long for the days when every single entity involve in real estate or casinos was called Trump, continues to soar; it rose $1.78, or 7.29%, on news that the company's namesake will star in a new TV show once she, er... gets out of prison. Now, I know there have been succesful companies that dealt with crooks (Warner Communications, which started as a merger between business in the three most mob-influenced industries around, comes to mind), but it's a gamble and not a business strategy.  The company's performance wasn't all that hot even before the CEO went to prison, and until very recently the stock price reflected that. But this is a one-person company, and at this point it's saying the 'Martha' brand is worth some $1.31 billion. If anything, the value of the brand should decline over time, inasmuch as she's rather, well, mortal. And she's been convincted of obstruction of justice. This runup is based on the inexplicable hope that now that the head of the firm and the embodiment of a much-resented brand is no longer doing time for lying to the Federal government, they'll be able to really coin some money. I just don't know what to say.    muckdog   ????-??-??T15:03:00  Martha should do a reality show. Take 10 contestants, and give them a situation: You have company coming over for dinner; You're hosting an open house; or, You're hosting a wedding reception. Then, she just ranks them and eliminates one every week. The stock would really go to the moon on that press release.    .

   Video Rentals: The Three Hypotheses     Byrne   2004-12-11T18:45:00  Scrappy underdog Netflix had its day earlier in the year, when it became one of the hottest stocks around (sporting an eye-popping P/E in the high 900's on the way up, and, thanks to a poor earnings report, over 1,000 on the way down). There's plenty of argument about the future of DVD and video rental, and Netflix represents a pure-play on one of the three dominant hypotheses:  I. That business is O-V-E-R -- Between pay-per-view, video-on-demand, pirated movies, high-bandwidth Internet broadcasts, and the increasing availability of other media, it takes some faith to see any future for movie rentals. Those who don't have the requisite faith will point to these factors as proof that the business is dying and the movie business in general will need a pretty significant overhaul before it can make profits. Movie rentals are no longer a cheap alternative to other ways of viewing films; they're the stodgy, expensive way. There aren't any pure-play buys on this theory, but someone who believes it might overweight their portfolio in cable companies -- if they purchased any media stocks at all. Of course, there have been companies whose performance would perfectly mimic the validity of this idea, but Psuedo.com failed without producing a single show, and Broadcast.com was swallowed for $6 billion by Yahoo!, to Yahoo!'s great regret.  II. Not so fast -- it'll just go online! -- Anyone who wants to counter that argument would probably start by taking us back to 1997, when in terms of time used, text was the most popular kind of information online. At the time, and for years after, people argued that the traditional bookstore would become obsolete. After all, how could we stand for a rapaciously arborcidal medium like 'books' or 'newspapers' when we could transmit the same data as bits and bytes and save on transportation, too? As it turns out, of course, Amazon.com, BarnseandNoble.com, and a host of others simply took the bookstore model, attached a 56K modem, and declared themselves The Future. Netflix is doing much the same thing: Taking the traditional business online to cut costs and boost customer service.  III. Who d'you think you're kidding? You can't kill movie rental stores -- So there's a big difference between movies and books: For books, the retail store is practically the sole medium of distribution; if you don't sell through them, books won't get sold. For movies, the video rental store is just one way to get videos out there (though at 45-55% of studio revenues, it's a much more important one than people think). But given the high valuations ascribed to bricks-and-mortar-and-dead tree booksellers like Barnes and Noble , Borders , and to a much lesser extent Books-A-Million , surely there's room for a Blockbuster , along with a Movie Gallery or two. The latter, at least, still has room to grow. By focusing on smaller, rural communities (preferably the sort that considers DSL 'newfangled') they're WalMarting WalMart -- competing with Walmart's awful in-store video rentals by offering better selection and much lower prices.  The movie business is changing dramatically as the potential for online distribution grows, but like every other business it leaves lots of room for traditional operators to operate at traditional (read: high) profits. The aggressive bidding war for Hollywood Video , featuring two of their competitors, a buyout shop, and one of the savviest raiders around, is proof that some people still think these stores are worth something. And I'm one of them.  Full Disclosure: For once, I'm actually writing about something I own: I have shares of Movie Gallery, I've suggested it to friends, and I'd be quite thrilled if the stock went up. I don't do 'sell targets', but I'd probably hold the stock if it ran up anything less than 50% from this level. If I sell, I'll post a notification one trading day beforehand. Because Lord knows you care.    .

   WalMart: Conglomerating?     Byrne   2004-12-12T14:47:00  Conglomerates are a fascinating species: The standard definition is 'a company involved in multiple unrelated businesses' but the more accurate definition would be 'a company that relies on financial pyrotechnics, balance sheet juggling, and adroit accounting to create the illusion of growth'. I love to write about them, but I'd hate to own one, since most of their market value comes from the market's assumption that the company's leaders will somehow find a way to retroactively justify their overvaluation. Usually, it doesn't work, but when it does the results can be spectacularly entertaining. For a while (see Ling-Temco-Vought or Tyco for details).  The recent rumors about WalMart's plans to buy out a shipping company have given rise to the fear that the company may go the conglomerate route. They have many of the symptoms of a late-stage conglomerate: A gigantic main business with slowing growth, fear that competition will substantially reduce the profitability of their main business, a shareholder base that includes many people who own only WalMart stock (thus providing another incentive for intracompany diversification), and enough resources to pull it off on a grand scale.  I can understand the concerns, but I don't see the motivation. As a retailer of just about everything, WalMart can expand into some pretty broadly-defined areas without going beyond either their core competencies or some arenas where they can cut costs. After all, adding some international shipping assets to their holdings would be a natural extension of their enormously successful practice of buying the distribution network for their products. They're coming close to Smithfield Food's very successful 'squeal to meal' policy; if these rumors are true, the result for shareholders will be a pretty positive one.    .

   They're Kidding, Right?     Byrne   2004-12-13T07:22:00  So Oracle and Peoplesoft , who spent the last 18 months insulting one another in every imaginable way, are finally tying the knot ? The final price, $26.50 per share, beats all the previous bids by a huge margin -- of course, Oracle lowballed their earlier offers, and ended up basically bidding against themselves and the optimism of other Peoplesoft shareholders for a year and a half. It's been a pretty grueling fight (was it worth it? How much of Peoplesoft's most valuable -- human -- resources will walk out the door the day their options vest?) made all the more so by the widely-held assumption that Larry Ellison was either bluffing or screwing around.  So it's over. I don't have Oracle/Peoplesoft's spat to kick around anymore. I'll have to stick with condemning the merger as a totally unworkable deal between two sides who absolutely hate each other. And I won't dwell on the irony of an Oracle employee being driven out of Oracle, starting his own company, and forcing Ellison to spend $10.3 billion to get his company -- but not him -- back (though it does rather delightfully remind me of Coca-Cola basically giving away the bottling franchise and then spending billions to buy it back). Ellison is brilliant enough to make this merger work, but he's crazy enough to wreck even the soundest of deals. We shall see.    .

   Casino Stock Isn't Quite Blue-Chip     Byrne   2004-12-15T21:28:00  Back in the day (2000-2003 or so) some of the hottest non-homebuilding stocks were the gaming equipment manufacturers , who rode a wave of heavy reinvestment in casinos to produce huge profits. Now, all that reinvestment has paid off, and, along with a good dose of consolidation, made the industry moderately hot again.  Like every boom, whether merited or not, the big companies have big moves in the early stage, but it doesn't get attention or turn into a mania until we see a frenetic IPO or two. You know where this is going: Las Vegas Sands kicked off its first trading day with a 60% gain after a last-minute increase in offering price to $29 a share, outside the $24-$26 range bandied about after they dropped their first $20-$22 estimate. But, well, the business is complicated and the business is tough.  Wynn Resorts , another owner of the lucrative Macau license that captured investors's attention during the IPO, illustrates this well enough: Steve Wynn, the company's founder, made a gigantic fortune when he bet his company's future on Atlantic City. When investors saw his $160 million all-debt investment turn into a $440 million asset in just a few years -- his net worth took a similar, though even less gravitationally-bound arc, rising from $2 million to $75 million durign the same time) they all rushed in. Needless to say, Wynn sold when everyone else bought, and he made it through the cannibalizing near-collapse those casinos faced in the early 90's.  So, applause and cheers all around to the casinos raising such spectacular sums for your broad-scoped ambitions. And a premature apology to the newly-minted shareholders, who will doubtless see some eye-popping returns in the right direction for a little while and then face a long road back to the reality that is a price around half the current one.  Full disclosure, just for the hell of it: I was bearish about the Google IPO, too. Thank God I didn't sell short    .

   Russia's Situation Worsens     Byrne   2004-12-17T08:01:00  Gazprom, the main Russian gas company, has been denied a $10 billion credit line due to the political situation in Russia. The company intended to use the cash to pay an artificially low price for Yukos assets (hence that firm's bankruptcy filing a few days ago -- you know it's bad when you have to use US courts to protect your own assets from appropriation by your home country). It's starting to look like Putin's goal is a sort of judicial nationalization -- taking control of key assets through court, rather than executive, fiat. But the markets have caught on, and Russia may be deprived of the capital it needs to grow. Don't expect any of the Russian leadership to reverse course; given the current trends there, they'll just Blame the West when their screwy plan screws them over.    .

   Yukos's "Mystery Bidder"     Byrne   2004-12-19T15:09:00  So far, the Yukos auction has produced more questions than answers, and so far the biggest of the former is just who made off with their prize assets. Auctioneers reported a $9.3 billion winning bid for Yuganskneftgaz -- the company's main asset, worth two to three times that amount -- by an anonymous company located in Tver. Well, sort of. It turns out the anonymous company, BaikalFinansGroup, shares an address with OOO Tverneftemash, which was recently bought by ZAO Gazpromgeocomservice, not to ever be confused by the similarly-named Gazprom (which by the way has a similar logo). Gazprom, of course, is the gigantic, Kremlin-supported gas company most observers assumed would bid for the assets. There aren't many groups in Russia who can afford a $9.3 billion bet, particularly when it's such a politically-weighted one. Gazprom may have arranged some last-minute debt financing, or might have an outside partner, but I seriously doubt they weren't in some way involved with the company that won the auction.  The logos:    .

   Everlast's Rally Just Might Live up to the Name     Byrne   2004-12-20T15:37:00  Microscopic microcap Everlast , mainly a maker of boxing equipment, has soared over the last several days thanks to a licensing deal with Jacques Moret allowing Moret to buy out their women's apparel license for $30 million, on top of a $12.5 million payment now. In other words, a competitor has decided that one segment of the company's business is potentially worth $42.5 million. Investors have prudently valued the remaining business -- the extremely well-known Everlast brand, the possible new reality TV show, and most of the company's assets -- at a negative $16.5 million. The company's stock would have to rise more than 50% from the current level to put a zero value on that business. And, who knows? It might.    .

   Krispy Kreme -- At Least we Have Consensus     Byrne   2005-01-05T19:01:00  Well, we don't, but we've something very much like it: A company hitting and then rehitting lows that would have been unthinkable even after their pull-back a year ago, accusations and proof of some less-than-Kosher accounting, and, best of all, allegations of egregious self-dealing by insiders. A glance at the analyst opinions shows that they have a lone bull cheerleading the stock, and plenty of bears hammering it.  That's evidence enough that it's underpriced; the market usually reacts to a downgrade by dropping the stock a percent or two, but I can't help it -- I presume most of these downgrades arose from the classic "Well, what does your analyst think?" "He says it's a buy," "Well, what's it done this year?" conversation. Nobody wants to be caught recommending a loser, and unlike portfolio managers with a Net Asset Value report card every trading day, analysts can essentially start fresh with each new opinion. The best analysts get noted, lauded, and showered with cash. The worst? Well, they're still averaged in with the rest.  And anyway, I don't consider analysts anything but aggregators of publically-available information and echo-chambers for previously-determined opinions. They can't really add much without straying into the realm of inside information, and what they do add is usually factored in the moment the report is released. Or, in an ideal world, it should be. Thankfully, ours is a less-than-ideal, though by no means dystopic, market, so we get plenty of opportunities to profit from the mistakes of others. As long as the bearish opinions of analysts weighs down on Krispy Kreme , I'll be a bull.    .

   Not an ordinary earnings miss?     Byrne   2005-01-20T16:41:00  eBay 's nauseating $19.72 decline (a loss of 19.14%) has that end-of-an-era feel, like the Motorola crash described in The Money Game or the nadir of the dot.com collapse profiled in Dot.con . There's news, of course (the only time there's no news whatsoever is when the entire market tanks), but missing estimates by a penny and showing some 'red flags' shouldn't be an excuse for lopping off twice as much as the market had the night before (after hours, eBay had lost a modest 10% or so). Watching a stock drop after hours, open lower, and close even lower than that makes me wonder just who's selling: a runup usually builds on a gradual crescendo of greater-fool theory -- everyone thinks they can always sell to someone dumber -- and ends when the greatest fool yet gets sick of the whole thing and bails.    muckdog   ????-??-??T21:06:00  Well, it's owned heavily by everyone.

   Vioxx: Slightly Bigger Deal than we Thought?     Byrne   2005-01-26T07:11:00  Merck posted a 21% decline in earnings thanks to the new post-Vioxx announcement. Most of the profit decline was because Vioxx, representing about 11% of sales, now represents a pretty severe legal headache: Not only have they lost the revenue, but they've taken a $600 million charge as a reserve against future Vioxx losses. If that's an accurate number, investors should cheer up: Merck's at fifteen times annualized earnings, twelve times forward earnings, and underappreciated by most of Wall Street.  Full Disclosure: I own Merck. I bought the day of the Vioxx announcement. And if I want to stay that contrarian, I'll have to sell only when I get an inside tip that they've cured cancer, AIDS, heart disease, and death.    J. Nathan   ????-??-??T19:49:00  If you read the quarterly more carefully, you'll notice that the charge is not related to liabilities from Vioxx but merely costs associated with legal defense, i.e., just the cost of paying the lawyers in all of these cases. If thats how much they're willing to pay for legal defense, imagine how much the actual liabilities are gonna be.  Good blog, I found you via your instalanche.    Byrne   ????-??-??T22:43:00  Thanks for your compliments. Usually, I don't read the filings as carefully as I should -- I leave it up to alert readers, I guess. Anyway, I still think the Vioxx risk is overestimated -- if the tobacco industry can sell something with no health benefits for years, get sued, and 1) Keep the product on the shelves, 2) Remain in business, and 3) do 2) to the tune of several billion dollars per year in profits, we Merckers might be safe.    .

   China: We could always ignore them, right?     Byrne   2005-01-27T07:16:00  One of the rules of thumb that has guided my (limited) business career from the beginning is that China is never as lucrative as it looks. This assumption is based on about 150 years of economic history, including several booms in interest and investment in China. Their biggest problem: There's usually a 200-to-1 ratio of Nearly Starving Peasant Laborers to Absurdly Well-Off Government Employees. And now it's an iffier 100-to-1, since there are also rich private sector employees and the labor force isn't quite so expendable. What they've been missing for years was the real driver behind any consumer economy: Consumers. Specifically, they didn't have a real middle class. That's changed in the last twenty years, as increasing social mobility and a burst in foreign demand has finally made China a genuine, rather than theoretical, contender. And they've even supplied proof of their economic viability, announcing that they've beaten Japan for exports to the US .  If only I'd figured this out in early 2002, when their stock market was by some stretch of the imagination cheap.    Tanger   ????-??-??T10:10:00  I dunno if you want anything to do with their stock market. For one, its perforance last year was pretty dismal. More importantly, its a structural nuthouse. Unfortunately, minority shareholder rights are virtually non-existent, and excluding the dodgy financial statements listed on the exchange, lots of times companies are more interested in generating cash from an IPO then actually bothering with shareholder value. This Economist article (not sure if registration is required, sorry)  http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=1447832  Finally, the Shanghai Composite on July, 1997 was trading at 1189.76. As of January 27, 2005 it's sitting at 1225.89. That's an annualized return of roughly .4%. The 5 year return is even worse (http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=^SSEC&t=5y).

   Off the hook? Give us a break!     Byrne   2005-02-01T07:48:00  Georgia's Insurance Commissioner, John Oxendine, claims that Marsh 'got off the hook' -- and you can bet he's got a plan to fix that. Perhaps the worst feature of Spitzer's Attila the Hun-like sweep through the financial services industry is his habit of breeding imitators, who will essentially use his settlement as a benchmark for creating their own demands. Interestingly enough, this morning's Wall Street Journal reported that Marsh paid a higher fee than they needed to -- that the $850 million number was agreed upon at the last minute mainly so Marsh could pay out over a four-year period without admitting guilt. The rhetoric we're hearing -- that Marsh may have cost customers billions of dollars -- doesn't match the reality that in a few cases, they manipulated bids, but that the proven damages thus far involve only a few million dollars of business priced 5% or 10% higher than it otherwise would have been. Crazy.  Full Disclosure: I own shares of Marsh, and I would not be particularly dissapointed if Eliot Spitzer's career took a sudden nosedive thanks to, say, questions about his business relationship to money manager and alleged stock manipulator Jim Cramer. Nothing personal; I just think he's the Fifth Horseman of the fiscal apocalypse, representing Irresponsible Investing with Wild Abandon.    .

   The Exponentials     Byrne   2005-02-04T13:22:00  It's always difficult to get used to a central fact of the modern economy: The best new technology will keep getting better at an absolutely astounding rate. Usually, the improvement curve flattens pretty fast -- the usual auto industry/computer industry comparison works just fine (According to the standard urban legend, Bill Gates notes that "If we'd been making cars instead of software, you'd get 500 miles to the gallon, need an oil change every 250,000 miles, and be able to replace your car for $200," to which a mythical GM executive replies "Ah, but if Microsoft made cars, they'd crash three times a day, too!").  Anyway, a few announcements during the last two days underscore the fact that the growth in memory and processing power for computers is far from over: Hewlett-Packard is developing a new replacement for the transistor , and a consortium of software companies is backing a new technology that would allow discs to hold up to a terabyte of information . No idea where this will end up: It's not altogether rare that these announcements result in a very expensive project to develop something that, for whatever reason, isn't worthwhile to consumers. But it's important to remember that the status quo is never more than a snapshot -- investing as though it's permanent is a recipe for disaster.    .

   The "Twin Deficits" Myth     Byrne   2005-02-04T13:37:00  According to the usually reliable CNN/Money, the "Twin Deficits" will continue to grow . Interesting terminology... I believe they're referring to the budget deficit and... the capital surplus? When analyzing trade deficits, it's important to realize that the amount by which imports exceed exports is also equal to the net amount foreign investors have bet on the US. So the trade deficit is due to a confluence of the pressures from US consumers (who control about 20% of global GDP) and everybody else (excluding the non-consumption share of US GDP, that would amount to around 75% of global GDP). Which of those is -- probably -- going to be a more important number?  Even if we are consumers bent on gorging ourselves with imported goods, the largest pressure on the deficit is that we're simply a better place for investment -- higher returns on capital in developing countries are more than mitigated by the higher political risks they face. And what about that other deficit? It, of course, is the ominous sum that we fund without taxes, but by borrowing funds. And about half of those borrowings end up with the major banks in Asia. So, not to be a heretic, but 1) We're issuing them at relatively low interest rates, 2) Inflation is bound to pick up eventually, and so 3) Wouldn't you rather have our deficits made up by economically nonsensical purchases by non-US investors, rather than raising taxes in America? It's a question of who will pay for the same spending, and all else being equal I'd be happy for Asian central banks to pick up the tab. The Twin Deficits are a reality, but they aren't exactly a terrifying one.    .

   NYSE Selling Out? Thank God!     Byrne   2005-02-04T17:36:00  The market didn't have an intelligent way to react to this news (except to send NASDAQ , which I've been cheerleading for a while, up 10.46% in sympathy), but the New York Stock Exchange may actually convert to a for-profit entity. It's far too clubby now, and while this move wouldn't get rid of nine-figure paydays, it might ensure that they only happen when well-deserved. Not to name names or anything. The exchange needs this: it's ossified, the real owners -- holders of exchange seats -- have seen their investment lose 40% in a year (though they can still earn an income from it to offset the losses), and the NASDAQ has undercut their traditional dominance among growth companies-turned-blue chips. Heck, they're down to just over half of their single-letter symbols ! It's a dying organization, and this will be just the jolt it needs for another couple decades of somnambulant staggering before being ultimately replaced by far more efficient companies.  Full Disclosure: "Far more efficient companies," basically means "The NASDAQ," so take it with a gigantic grain of salt.  Secondary Disclosure: You can take the above at face value; I don't own stock in a salt company.    muckdog   ????-??-??T19:15:00  Everything comes with lots of grains of salt. Ever read the label on a soup can? It's amazing they can squeeze any liquid in there. And if you crumble up crackers in there, that's even more salt.  Well, I'm not sure how I take the NYSE news. I think I agree with you on the wreckless compensation thing. I also think that Sears-Kmart should come up with a new name altogether. Those stores are deadzones, and they need some buzz. Change the names, paint the buildings, reorganize a little, and hire strippers for cashiers. I'm not sure how that last idea got in there. Must be friday.    .

   Nostalgia Alert     Byrne   2005-02-05T13:58:00  I really miss the days when a major international oil company could basically buy some tiny, ill-established foreign government to get at its natural resources. We've progressed a bit since then: Now, the third world countries all have their own state oil companies, who are picking apart the carcasses of once-private concerns.

   Gmail: Cachet for Everybody!     Byrne   2005-02-06T19:51:00  At first, I was pretty skeptical of Gmail -- an announcement of something new, cool, and free, from a quirky company, on April Fool's Day? Turns out my initial attitude wasn't justified, of course, and Gmail has been a popular success. Just this weekend, Google gave many users another fifty invitations , prompting some to speculate that it could be the start of Gmail's final move out of beta. Their marketing was absolutely brilliant: Simply through association with Google, and because of the invitation-only membership, they created a product with instant cachet -- something so in demand invitations went for $50 on eBay, and one enterprising site even offered a kidney for an invite. And now? Everyone who wants a Gmail account has one, and yet people with invites have an almost pathological desire to give them away. It's been nearly a year, the service is nearly ubiquitous, and somehow Google has kept us obsessed with Gmail.  Want an invite? I've got a dozen.

   Even more blogospheric M&A?     Byrne   2005-02-06T20:09:00  Frenetic merger and acquisition activity doesn't mean much in the early days of a business -- it's just as likely that ridiculously overfunded startups are buying out their bankrupt competitors to create larger and less stable conglomerates as it is that forward-thinking visionaries are cutting off their competitors early. But when an outsider buys into the business once it's established itself as important, but before it's really gotten profitable, it's big news. For now, it's just a rumor that Ask Jeeves is buying Bloglines . I'd keep an eye on this -- if Ask Jeeves pops on the news, the easy money from the blogging trend is already gone.

   Cisco's Indication     Byrne   2005-02-08T20:33:00  Today's performance said a lot about how the market viewed certain subjects; tomorrow's will tell us even more. Today, Ask Jeeves made their official announcement about acquiring Bloglines. And tonight, Cisco reported solid earnings and weak sales . The market's modestly pessimistic reaction to the Bloglines news tells us that blogging isn't seen as a major profit source yet; tomorrow's trading will tell us whether the market is ready to accept that more established technology businesses are back on track as well. After hours, Cisco's been slammed, but once they're exposed to the rest of the trading population, the results might differ.    Michael   ????-??-??T09:29:00  I don't think bloglines will ever be a major source of profits or revenues. Blogging itself could become a pretty big consumer past time like watching TV, reading a book, or playing video games but I am not sure how bloglines really benefits. I would guess it most benefits the search engines, hit counters, and software builders.  With the explosion in available market commentary that happened through the internet it is not clear to me that by lowering the costs of access blogging really adds that much as much as it did to political commentary. Maybe Seeking Alpha can become the new TSCM but I don't think that will change the landscape as much as Howard Dean's campaign did.    .

   Poliblogs versus Stockblogs     Byrne   2005-02-08T20:59:00  Stephen of IRA-CAM is experiencing Sitemeter envy over all those succesful political blogs. Understandable! After all, my biggest surge in hits came from a link from, well, a political blog. However, I'd rather not worry -- instead, I'd like to think of our situation as akin to Instapundit , or Andrew Sullivan , or Daily Kos in, say, the summer of 2001. Blogs didn't get huge until people saw them updated continuously on September 11th, and during the primaries, and later on during the conventions. In politics, there's a definite four-year cycle, and any new medium can find its voice and carve out an audience in that  In short, we need a crash, and we need to blog it.    jult52   ????-??-??T12:50:00  Your time will come.    Byrne   ????-??-??T17:39:00  That sounds downright sinister .    ira-cam   ????-??-??T22:39:00  Those poliblog hits come at a cost. My half-hearted trolling dragged back some hate to my site.

When you're blogging about stocks, it's possible -- though a little difficult -- to say "Okay, you're right, I'm wrong. So I'm going to sell what I had, and sell it short!" And everyone can be reasonably happy. But a political blog is usually built around a certain ideology, and no matter how compelling you are, you probably won't change anyone's stated opinions (Instant Counterpoint: Check Little Green Footballs now, and compare that to the September 11th archive).    .

   Sirius Satellite -- Brilliant Plan, or Grasping at Straws?     Byrne   2005-02-09T19:23:00  Mel Karmazin is pushing to add Sirius Satellite services to iPods -- an interesting idea, inasmuch as it seems to defeat the purpose of both. The iPod's the tiniest possible container for vast music libraries, and Sirius is a way to get at lots of content when said music library is unavailable. On the other hand, Karmazin and Jobs are two of the smartest dealmakers around, so they might find a way to structure this or spin it to the benefit of everyone. My main suspicion is that this is Karmazin hoping to see the phrase "Mel Karmazin, CEO ["That's right," Mel says to himself, "C-E-friggin- O !"] of Sirius Satellite Radio..."    ira-cam   ????-??-??T23:58:00  Steve Jobs knows a bad idea when he's pitched it, for exactly the reasons you point out. Plus, a satellite receiver burns a lot of power, even if it could be made tiny.

   Out come the long knives     Byrne   2005-02-10T21:38:00  Apparently Carly made a lot of journalistic enemies during her six hears at HP. Not only was the catalyst for her fall from grace a Fortune article by Carol Loomis (who as far as I know is immortal -- she's been writing for Fortune since 1954), but the anti-Carly brigades are out in full force at Salon.com . This is getting a little harsh; she might have messed up at HP (I refuse to call it by the new name, for now), but she wasn't actively trying to destroy a great company and wreck the shareholders. It just, well, happened. So, right, Carly was a bad manager, and she eventually got what she deserved, but she isn't evil incarnate.    .

   Blockbuster/Hollywood -- A debt-based hostile takeover?     Byrne   2005-02-12T16:07:00  I've been keeping a careful eye on the Blockbuster / Hollywood machinations for a while (and well I should -- I have stock in one of the deal's participants, Movie Gallery ), but even so I'm surprised that Blockbuster's latest gambit is to buy up Hollywood's debt . It's an admirable hedge -- if Movie Gallery wins, it could improve Hollywood's rating, and either way it offers Blockbuster some leverage. And this is, as far as I know, the first time since the Allegheny deal that there's been a hostile takeover using debt.    .

   Joe Granville's Still At It     Byrne   2005-02-12T17:17:00  Joseph Granville, the octogenarian technical analyst, has predicted a precipitous decline in stock prices this year . I'm a little bearish, myself (it always helps), but I've taken the liberty of checking some alternate sources for Granville information , from which I get the following incident: Granville's behavior easily attracted public attention. His investment seminars were bizarre extravaganzas, sometimes featuring a trained chimpanzee who could play Granville's theme song, "The Bagholder's Blues," on a piano. He once showed up at an investment seminar dressed as Moses, wearing a crown and carrying tablets. Granville made extravagant claims for his forecasting ability. He said he could forecast earthquakes and once claimed to have predicted six of the past seven major world quakes. He was quoted by Time magazine as saying, "I don't think that I will ever make a serious mistake in the stock market for the rest of my life," and he predicted that he would win the Nobel Prize in economics .  Sounds like a paragon of stability and common sense to me!    .

   Verizon/MCI -- That's all, folks!     Byrne   2005-02-14T21:15:00  I was hoping for another incredibly drawn-out story, full of antitrust drama, lurking potential bidders, and contentious confrontations between executives. And then MCI just sort of accepted a Verizon deal without really bothering anybody . Clearly, their corporate culture has suffered -- 25 years ago, MCI was the brawling upstart in the telecom industry, constantly challenging AT&T's right to exist, much less to monopolize the phone system. And now, they're swallowed by Just Another Monolith. I expected better -- meaner and tougher, sure, but better nonetheless.    .

   G's Investing -- Greenspan and Star Wars     Byrne   2005-02-15T18:58:00  G's Investing argues that Alan Greenspan is a George Lucas-esque figure : In the Star Wars universe of George Lucas, he portrays a benevolent dictatorship (or benevolent monarchy) as being superior to a democracy, with the democracy being the system rife with bureaucracy and bloat. With Greenspan's unspoken position as economic czar, that's what we have right now: a benevolent dictatorship of the Fed. But one of the why dictatorships are so inferior to democracies is that democracy offers a stable, peaceful transfer of power. Will we have that at the Fed, when Greenspan leaves  Indeed.    muckdog   ????-??-??T19:19:00  Can't remember where I saw this, maybe at socialsecuritychoice.org. Anyways, the battle lines for social security privatization are being identified as those who are for Choice and Ownership (Bush), versus those who equate investing in the SP500 as playing the slot machines (AARP, most Democrats, etc).  The battle is now for the endorsement of Sir Alan Greenspan. Where will Dr. Greenshades come down in this debate? What will he say on privatization and the associated costs with implementing such a system? I think that'll have a pretty big impact on what happens next...    Byrne   ????-??-??T19:25:00  Ooohhh... I can't tell you how much I want to take sides here, but I'm trying to keep my political opinions out of this -- I'd really hate to alienate half my political audience in a single endorsement. So I'll just note that I don't see it as quite so black-and-white, and I think some of the compromises (like reducing taxes for parents, on the grounds that children are the assets backing Social Security) might be useful and -- we are dealing with a win-or-lose, vote-or-not situation -- practical.    muckdog   ????-??-??T21:16:00  Yeah, I'm interested in hearing some obtuse Greenspanisms regarding this topic...    .

   Northshore Management Update     Byrne   2005-02-16T21:20:00  Northshore Management, the hedge fund firm accused of stealing millions of dollars in client funds, is now facing actual SEC action . The amount in question: $37 million. While it's not a major sum compared to the amounts consider before (as high as $90 million), it's good to see that the issue's getting resolved.  Though, of course, there's always the chance that these fund managers were stupid and shortsighted, not actually criminal; apparently, the money stolen was lent to or invested in companies the managers controlled -- so they're guilty of front-running, at the least. But they might have been using Northshore as an alternative source of capital: Having invested all they could risk, it would only make sense to turn to other sources. What we'll need to look for in the coming weeks are 1) What happened to the money once it was invested in these companies (were they real companies, or just avenues for stolen funds?) and 2) How much of this was disclosed beforehand.    .

   An Airline Passenger's Bill of Rights?     Byrne   2005-02-17T21:15:00  Has the EU once again lost its mind? The one industry in which Europe incontrovertibly beats the US is their aviation industry , thanks mainly to the fact that their lawmakers have left the operation of the industry up to the people who own it, and left passenger's rights in the hands of choosy passengers. And now they're ready to 'fix' that with a new package of ill-advised rules completely changing the nature of airlines . Before, a potential customer could choose between a cosy, near-certain ride from an expensive company or a hustled, uncomfortable, and absurdly cheap one from a smaller competitor. And now? Not a chance.    .

   Russia: Pure potential, or, potentially, nothing     Byrne   2005-02-22T07:29:00  Read this report on the U.S.-Russia Technology Symposium . It's a great summary of the paradoxes of the Russian economy: They have a huge untapped supply of valuable IT labor, but their IT exports are only a tenth of their military exports (and only a thirtieth of India's IT exports). They develop lots of new technology, but nobody can tell who owns what. And, of course, their securities laws and property rights are even flimsier than China's -- after the Putin administration mugged Yukos on the grounds that it was too attractive a target to leave alone, they lost a lot of trust. Still, they have an unbelieveable amount of untapped potential.    .

Let's be clear: There are few worse times to buy a stock than when the namesake and guiding force behind the company is in prison (whether or not she really should be), advertising is down by nearly half, and the brand has been tarnished beyond recognition. And yet the stock's within a few points of an all-time high. Wonders never cease.    .

   Khodorkovsky denies guilt     Byrne   2005-02-25T05:41:00  Well, I would, too. On the other hand, the Russian legal system is a bit less, well, legalistic -- they seem much more concerned about the chance that someone will harm the state than about actual matters of right and wrong. So it's pretty significant that Mikhail Khodorkovsky is taking the risk of maintaining his innocence . At this point, he has essentially no chance of recovering anything, unless Russia sees a change in political control and the US applies some pressure.    .

   Southern states considering higher cigarette taxes?     Byrne   2005-02-26T14:44:00  Good plan; cigarettes impose pretty high penalties on states, inasmuch as the states are caretakers for plenty of people who are ill thanks to cigarettes. What's notable in this debate, however, is that according to MSN Moneycentral , tobacco executives are attacking the tax by noting that "While North Carolina's excise tax is only 5 cents, the total taxes given to North Carolina by smokers adds up to more than 61 cents per pack." Okay, okay -- since the tobacco companies pay lots of money to the states, that's technically accurate. But the point of these taxes is to align the price of a pack with the cost to society, and inasmuch as these penalties aren't assessed on a per-pack basis, they don't -- they're a lump-sum reflection of the taxes these companies ought to have paid before.  Interestingly, the policy of making cigarette buyers pay to compensate society for the costs they impose is a politically palatable synthesis of the unpalatable notion of simply refusing treatment unless they pay full cost. They're basically buying future medical care throughout their lives, rather than eventually making the (healthy) remainder of the populace pay up. In short: Good plan.    .

   Icahn's back!     Byrne   2005-02-28T22:11:00  You'd think he was busy enough with Blockbuster and Hollywood , but Carl Icahn is once again going after Mylan labs . I'd love to call it a classic raid -- he's making an offer for the company, nominating his own board, claiming management can accept one or the other or both, and hinting that if they paid him enough, he'd probably go away. But the whole point of raiding is to outsmart an opponent, and that means the strategy changes constantly. In this case, the most interesting twist is that he's shorting shares of Mylan's acquisition target, King Pharmaceuticals; he's basically doubling down on the bet that they won't acquire. Not only that, but if Mylan bought him out, they'd have less money to fund a purchase of King Pharmaceuticals. Either way, he's showing a lot of confidence. Given his record, it's warranted.    .

   Who will lead the revolution? Would you believe MBAs?     John A   2004-12-24T10:07:00  For my holiday post, I offer a message of hope for the business world.  In 1994, I was a graduate student in Boston. I was asked to moderate a panel discussion on social entrepreneurship for a conference at Harvard Business School. The conference was being held by a new group called Students for Responsible Business. I expected to see a small gathering of idealistic, slightly naive MBA students. What I found was a packed room of 200 intelligent, practical,driven idealists. These students were determined to figure out how to use business as a driver for positive social change. I left that room with my eyes open to the possibilities presented by these future business leaders.  Fast forward 10 years. Students for Responsible Business is now called Net Impact . In 2004, I had the opportunity to attend their conference hosted by The University of Texas McCombs Business School. Net Impact had grown to include over 9,000 MBA students and alumni. Approximately 900 people attended the 2004 conference. The buzz words flying around the conference included social entrepreneurship, sustainable profitability, working with passion. I met student after student intent on harnessing the forces of business and capitalism to improve the world. These students understand that business is a powerful lever of change in this world.  Recently business schools have received their share of criticism for turning out graduates who seem to have lost sight of their responsibility for ethical action. I can tell you that I am seeing a powerful groundswell of change coming from within business schools. It is not coming from the faculty, or the alumni, or the administration. All these groups continue to pay lipservice to topics of social responsibility while avoiding any real innovations in the student experiences. The change is being demanded by the students. A little secret of business schools is that MBA students have an immense amount of sway. Few choose to use it, but if they want they can fundamentally change their school. Right now students at business schools are asking for more discussion of these topics in classes, are initiating service projects, forming support group for social entrepreneurs, inviting speakers to campus to discuss sustainability, social investing, non-profit innovations, etc. Net Impact is often at the center of these efforts.  These are not isolated events...This is a revolution from within. I have no doubt that in 10 years we will see the vast positive impact that these students are having in the world of business and society at large.  In 1776 Adam Smith spoke of enlightened self-interest in The Wealth of Nations . I often feel that we have conveniently forgotten his emphasis on enlightened which he defined as being committed to being a good citizen and steward of society. I am excited and hopeful that this new generation of business leaders will bring this emphasis front and center.  If you are an MBA student and want a good reference for comparing how MBA programs integrate issues of sustainability and social responsibility into the student experience a good place to start is the Beyond Grey Pinstripes report produced by The Aspen Institute .  Happy Holidays to everyone!!    .

   It's Good to be the King!     John A   2005-01-03T09:44:00  Here's an entertaining little morsel from Business Week Online (no byline given):  But on the subject of succession, those two look like role models compared with insurance giant American International Group Inc. ( AIG ), whose aging CEO has no plans to retire. Maurice R. "Hank" Greenberg, who turns 80 in May, groomed two sons to be successors, but both have since left AIG.Greenberg Sr. then created an office of the chairman in 2002, which includes co-COOs Martin J. Sullivan and Donald P. Kanak. Both are considered possible successors, but the board won't know Greenberg's preference until his departure, when it opens a sealed letter. Perhaps this is a good time for a quick refresher.... The CEO works for the board ...end lesson.  I guess it is not as straight forward when your CEO is also chairman and one of the largest shareholders. It would be tempting to get on my high horse right now about the need to separate the positions of CEO and Chairman but to be honest with you I don't really believe that. I know CEO/chair duality is a popular cause for corporate governance. However there is little empirical evidence to suggest that separating these roles affects firm performance in either a positive or negative way. Having a combined CEO/Chairman does reduce the ability of the board to act as a check on management and this does mean that you need to be more critical in your assessment of the trustworthiness of the top management team. This downside of having a combined CEO/chair is offset by (1) a reduction of coordination and communication costs at the top of the organization and (2) an increase in the negotiating position of the CEO when dealing with suppliers, potential merger partners, etc. #2 could be particularly useful in a dynamic industry.  I do however look more carefully at the top management team of a company with a CEO/Chair before investing. It is important that you can get a sense of the trustworthiness of the CEO. Is there high turnover among senior managers? Is there a record of regulatory problems? If the CEO is new, I also look at the performance of the CEO's previous company. I am most concerned if the fortunes of the prior employer took a sudden turn for the worse after the CEO left.    .

   How to find securities class action lawsuits     John A   2005-01-05T09:22:00  Yesterday's bad day for Krispy Kreme included some speculation that the new securities lawsuit filed against the company would be granted class action status. If you are interested in getting information about securities class actions for a company, you should check out the Stanford Law School's Securities Class Action Clearinghouse . This site has a very easy to use search function and it might be worth the time to run a quick check on companies of interest to you as possible investments.  Researchers affiliated with the clearinghouse just released an interesting report about securities class action trends during 2004. The results highlight trends in types of filings (increase in product market related filings), affected sectors (big increase in energy & technology sector), and overall number of filings (fairly steady).

   Shareholders Benefit from Employer Reputation     John A   2005-01-08T13:23:00  It is just about time for Fortune magazine to release its 2005 list of 100 Best Companies to Work For . So now is a good time to ask a simple question: Why should we care? Making this list is certainly a source of pride. It can also be helpful if you are looking for a nice new job. Should anyone else pay attention to this list?  Well, thanks for asking because I just happen to have an answer for that question. It turns out that investors can benefit by paying attention to this list as well. In a study published in the Journal of Business Finance & Accounting (2003, 30:771-798), Greg Filbeck and Dianna Preece found that companies on the Fortune list of 100 Best Companies to Work For outperformed a matched sample of firms along multiple measures of return. This study is particularly relevant for investors because the authors measured return after the list was announced. To often these studies use as a starting point the moment before information becomes public. The only way to benefit from such information is by holding the stock before the information becomes public. This study indicates that the Best Companies to Work For information may still be useful even after the information becomes public.  It might also be useful to look at companies that have consistently made the list in the previous few years and make an educated guess about their inclusion on this year's list. Search the news archives and see if in the past year the company did anything that might have totally pissed off their employees. Massive layoffs, bitter union battles, stopped offering free massages, etc. You might also want to be wary if the CEO or a bunch of other top executives have been replaced. That can often generate a period of uncertainty in a workforce.    .

   It's hard to complain about cheap airfares but..     John A   2005-01-09T19:47:00  I can't for the life of me figure out why anyone would invest in the airline industry. Please, someone tell me a group companies facing more serious problems than the legacy airline carriers (Delta, US Airways, Continental, American, Northwestern, United). High fuel costs, insane pension obligations, and a highly paid, specialized workforce. To this list of woes, we add a whole slew of competitors with much lower cost structures.  I admit I've already taken advantage of the lower fares announced last week to book a business trip but these next few years are not going to be pretty for some of these companies. Unfortunately, the pain is not limited to these companies. Pittsburgh, one of US Airway's hubs, built up its airport complete with a sprawling retail complex in the terminal. Now US Airways has reduced flights out of Pittsburgh by 28% since January of 2004 and is in real danger of folding completely. These shiny new airports are usually financed by long-term bonds that still have to paid off...but not by the airlines.  This is an industry looking for a sustainable strategy. Southwest and JetBlue were the only major airlines to earn a profit in 2004 but who knows what will be happening in another five years. So I will thankfully accept the low fares, bemoan the loss of food on flights, and watch these companies parade in and out of bankruptcy.  BusinessWeek Online has some other commentary about the fare cuts here and about US Airway's woes here .    .

   Better Late Than Ne...Aww forget it!     John A   2005-01-10T10:09:00  Remember how you stress every year to get those #%^^$%# tax forms filed on time? Just imagine how Nortel feels. Early on Tuesday Nortel will be filing its 2003 financial statements . It also expects to restate 2001 and 2002 earnings. None of this is really new information. So the worst is behind them right? Maybe. Late filing of audited financial statements and earning restatements both factor into my External Reporting organizational indicator. As a rule, I am wary of companies that do either of these things until I am confident that they have changed their standard business practices. It may take a couple years, and several more financial filings (on time of course), before I am persuaded to take a second look at the company. The bottom line is that I rely on SEC filings to assess companies and I don't want to have any doubt about the veracity of the information contained in these documents.  In Nortel's defense, they have just gone through the perfect storm in the telecommunications equipment sector. The whole industry overbuilt and got blindsided by the tech downturn. This could be described as a growth industry that went on a bender and is now trying to recover from the hangover. I've always felt that you learn a lot about someone when you see how they try to recover from a hangover (pause for brief college flashback). This is a great time to assess organizational effectiveness in the telecommunications equipment industry. Nortel and Lucent attempted to hide the damage (What do you mean? I'm not drunk!) and hope for an uptick in demand before they would have to come clean. Both companies have been penalized for these actions and have continued to restructure operations, sell assets, and layoff employees. Cisco, on the other hand, was able to take one huge restructuring charge in 2001 and move forward. Their ability to do this and have it work (so far) indicates a very deep and impressive understanding of their organization. Especially when compared to its competitors, Cisco seems to be back in fighting form due to it's ability to rapidly assess its organizational structure and reconfigure to meet the changing market. Not bad for a company with a hangover!    .

   Beyond Hippies and Tree Huggers     John A   2005-02-03T21:02:00  Socially responsible investing. Corporate social responsibility. Just saying these words seems to elicit some fairly simplistic knee-jerk reactions. The reaction that I find most amusing is the knowing look of sympathy. You know, the one that says "Poor naive soul. If only you understood economics, you would understand the folly of your ways." I do not intend to get into the stakeholder vs stockholder debate here or argue the relative merits of Atlas Shrugged . Those discussions, though interesting, avoid a simpler question. Do measures of corporate social responsibility contain valuable added information that help investors pick winning investments?  If all that you have read about this topic is an article in Business Week or The Wall Street Journal , you've probably heard the standard answer-- the evidence is mixed. That is true but not very revealing wouldn't you say? Evidence is mixed mostly because (1) there is little agreement about how to measure social responsibility and (2) many current measures toss together a heap of information that has no business being lumped together. Social responsibility often includes everything from treatment of employees to type of product produced. There is not really any reason to believe that selling guns or tobacco has anything to do with forcing employees to work unpaid overtime. Yet both get lumped together in the socially responsible investing discussion.  Once you start to break apart social responsibility into its various components, you start to see the valuable information. Companies that have poor employee relations tend to underperform, as do companies that pollute at a higher rate than their industry peers. On the other hand, companies with numerous NLRB violations don't do worse than their peers and companies that sell your typical "sin" products (tobacco, firearms, gambling) can be excellent investments. Lump all these things together and of course you will get mixed results. Taken separately, they provide valuable information about future firm performance.  I guess it is time to get beyond the image of the greedy capitalist vs. hippie tree hugger in this discussion. Though that would make a great Celebrity Death Match episode.  Here are abstracts from 16 significant studies about socially responsible investing and an interesting essay on the subject.    .

   I'll take a double shot     John A   2005-02-04T11:55:00  Yesterday was a tough day for the Seattle scene. Amazon ended the day down 14.6%. Starbucks down 8.2%. I should disclose that I spent a few years living in Seattle and I have a soft spot in my heart for all things Seattle. As far as I could tell, many people in the Northwest spend the mornings drinking lattes and their evenings drinking microbrews. Really not a bad lifestyle.  Anyway, back on topic here. Market over reaction? Hard to say. Both companies have pricey stocks and those valuations are based on optimistic expectations of future growth. Yesterday's news led many to question their growth assumptions for these companies. Today I want to talk a bit about Starbucks. I think I have to start by acknowledging that the stock is still pricey even after its drop yesterday. However, my organizational indicators analysis reveals a very low level of business risk . This may partially justify a higher P/E ratio. A couple weeks ago, I observed that Wal-Mart had offsetting strong and weak organizational indicators . Starbucks, on the other hand, has uniformly strong organizational indicators. Starbucks scores as best in its industry on six of seven organizational indicators. Not surprising are its strong scores in the employee relations and stakeholder actions indicators. Its weakest score is in the external reporting indicator. In the past, several observers have raised concerns about aggressive accounting at Starbucks but my analysis does not indicate any systematic current issues. The weak score is primarily the result of Starbucks current strategy of increasing equity ownership of several foreign subsidiaries. This is a strategic shift that has short-term costs and adds some uncertainty to the financial statements.  Beyond the strong Organizational Indicator analysis, several additional factors favor Starbucks ability to continue to grow revenues.  1. Starbucks has little debt. Starbucks is not currently financing its growth with debt. Considering its growth, this is amazing. It also means that Starbucks has a large amount of flexibility in how it finances future growth. The company can assume much more debt without negatively affecting its risk profile because...  2. Starbucks has a healthy cashflow and current cash position. This allows the company to grow without debt. You could argue that Starbucks has too much cash and should do more to pass it on to shareholders. This option is another way that Starbucks has retained its flexibility for the future.  3. Starbucks is the primary owner of its stores and limits franchising. While Starbucks does partner (airlines, airports, Barnes & Noble), most of its stores are company owned. From a managerial perspective this greatly simplifies cost structures, product changes, and quality control.  Taken together all of these factors paint a picture of a company with a very strong future. I cannot say if these factors justify the current share price but I would say that they justify a higher P/E ratio than the industry norm. Risk is lower.  Interesting aside: Starbucks is taking over the location in my town that was recently abandoned by Krispy Kreme.  Disclosure: At the time of this writing I do not own Starbucks stock...but I am tempted and might consider a buy next week. I am also tempted to go buy a latte after writing this post.    .
