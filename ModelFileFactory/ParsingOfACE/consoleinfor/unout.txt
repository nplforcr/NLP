   Death toll in Philippine blast could hit 30: radio ATTENTION - ADDS fears of toll rising ///   DAVAO, Philippines, March 4 (AFP)  At least 19 people were killed and 114 people were wounded in Tuesday's southern Philippines airport blast, officials said, but reports said the death toll could climb to 30.  Radio station DXDC placed the death toll at 30, without giving a source for the figure, which officials could not immediately confirm.  The Davao Medical Center, a regional government hospital, recorded 19 deaths with 50 wounded. Medical evacuation workers however said the injured list was around 114, spread out at various hospitals.  A powerful bomb tore through a waiting shed at the Davao City international airport at about 5.15 pm (0915 GMT) while another explosion hit a bus terminal at the city. There were no reports of injuries in the second blast.  "It's a very powerful bomb. The waiting shed literally exploded," said Vice Mayor Luis Bongoyan, speaking to local radio station  Television footage showed medical teams carting away dozens of wounded victims with fully armed troops on guard.  Many of the victims were shown with hastily applied bandages, and teams of nurses and doctors were seen in packed emergency rooms attending to the wounded.    .

   Sotheby's, Christie's pay 40 million dollars over antitrust suits   NEW YORK, March 11 (AFP)  The world's most powerful fine art auction houses, Sotheby's and Christie's, have agreed to pay 40 million dollars to settle an international price-fixing scam, Sotheby's said.  The payment, if approved by the courts, would settle a slew of suits by clients over auctions held between 1993 and 2000 outside the United States, it said in a statement.  "Under the terms of the settlement agreement, Sotheby's and Christie's will each pay 20 million dollars," said Sotheby's, which operates in 34 countries.  The deal required threatened British and Canadian claims against both auction houses to be dropped.  Buyers and sellers also would have to agree not to pursue further cases in foreign courts.  The litigation covers buyers in auctions outside the United States between January 1, 1993 and February 7, 2000, and sellers between September 1, 1995 and February 7, 2000.  Similar claims over US-based auctions were settled in an agreement struck in September 2000 for a total of 512 million dollars.  In December 2001, a Manhattan jury convicted Sotheby's main shareholder and former chairman Alfred Taubman of entering into a price-fixing agreement with Christie's.  Four months later, the billionaire was sentenced to one year in prison and a 7.5-million-dollar fine over the price-fixing, which prosecutors said had cost clients of both firms 400 million dollars.  Christie's was not prosecuted in the United States after its management agreed to testify against Sotheby's and provide documents needed to prove fraudulent intent.  Together, Sotheby's and Christie's control more than 90 percent of the fine art and antiques market.  Sotheby's said it would record the 20-million-dollar settlement as a special charge for 2002. It would be funded in two payments of 10 million dollars each upon preliminary and final court approval.    .

   Barry Diller resigns as CEO of Vivendi Universal Entertainment ATTENTION - ADDS details, background ///   NEW YORK, March 19 (AFP)  Media tycoon Barry Diller on Wednesday quit as chief of Vivendi Universal Entertainment, the entertainment unit of French giant Vivendi Universal whose future appears up for grabs.  In a statement, Diller -- who took on the "provisional" role at the top of Vivendi's US entertainment operations in December -- said his USA Interactive group will nonetheless remain a shareholder of Vivendi Universal Entertainment.  "My executive role was never intended to be permanent," said Diller. "Now that Vivendi Universal has begun a formal process in reviewing options for its entertainment assets, it is appropriate to step aside from any direct management responsibility."  As part of the 11-billion-dollar sale of USA Interactive's film and television operations to the French media company in December 2001, USA Interactive received 2.5 billion dollars in preferred shares in Vivendi Universal Entertainment.  Diller, 60, personally received a 1.5 percent stake in the business and had been touted as a likely candidate to run Vivendi Universal's entertainment unit in the United States if the troubled French media giant were broken up.  In Paris, the French media group said parent company chairman Jean-Rene Fourtou will replace Diller as chairman and chief executive of US unit.  Vivendi, in a statement, said that Diller had, "in full agreement with Vivendi Universal," announced that he was "ending his temporary assignment as CEO of Vivendi Universal Entertainment."  Vivendi Universal, the world's second-largest media group after AOL Time Warner of the United States, has been digging out from under a mountain of debt since the removal of expansionist boss Jean-Marie Messier last July, largely through asset sales.  Vivendi Universal earlier this month posted a record net loss of 23.3 billion euros (25.6 billion dollars) for 2002.  Faced with debt of 35 billion euros (37 billion dollars) in June last year -- including 19 billion from the media and telecoms division alone -- the sprawling conglomerate has set a target of reducing its debt by 16 billion euros by end-2004.  Speculation has been rife that troubled Vivendi has been weighing a spinoff or sale of its US film, television and theme park operations as part of its restructuring.  Press speculation had already suggested that Vivendi might decide to keep its Universal Music division, while either divesting or inviting third parties to take a minority stake in the remaining Entertainment assets.  Earlier this month, sources told Agence France Presse financial news unit AFX that Viacom is studying a bid for Vivendi's US entertainment assets placing it as a serious rival squarely in the running against oil billionaire Marvin Davis who has bid 20 billion dollars for the operations.  While other media companies like Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Liberty Media Corp, News Corp and General Electric Co's NBC have been mentioned as potential bidders for the Vivendi operations, Viacom is one of the few media companies with a balance sheet healthy enough to mount a bid.    .

   At least 200,000 in US, Canadian anti-war demonstrations = (PICTURES) = ATTENTION - UPDATES, ADDS details ///   NEW YORK, March 23 (AFP)  Some 70 people were arrested Saturday as demonstrators clashed with police at the end of a major peace rally here, as at least 200,000 anti-war protesters took to the streets across the United States and Canada.  For the most part the marches went off peacefully, but in New York a small group of protesters were arrested after they refused to go home at the end of their rally, police sources said.  Several police officers were treated for the effects of gas after the ensuing clashes -- a result, police said, of the demonstrators using self-defence devices.  Organisers claimed that some 250,000 people attended the rally, creating a human column some three kilometres (1.8 miles) long. Police put the attandance at around 125,000.  The city assigned 2,000 police officers to the rally, including undercover officers who carried beeper-sized radiation detectors and other counter-terrorism equipment.  Though opinion polls have shown public support for the war rising in the United States, opposition to military intervention in Iraq has given rise to an impassioned campaign.  Among the sea of banners making its way up Broadway were many signs poking fun at President George W. Bush. "Somewhere in Texas, a village is missing an idiot," said one sign. "Iraq war: An unelected extremist vs. an unelected extremist," and "Take the toys away from junior."  One woman marched topless with the words "shock and awe" daubed across her back in red ink, a reference to the bombing campaign unleashed Friday on Baghdad.  Liana Owen drove 10 hours from Pennsylvania to attend the rally in Manhattan with her parents. "It's important that people all over the world know that we don't believe in the war," she said.  Several thousand demonstrators also gathered outside the White House in Washington, accompanied by a major security presence.  "They can say they're 'smart bombs,' but smart bombs aren't able to distinguish between military and human targets," Abigail Fletcher, a marcher from Florida, said outside the president's residence.  Some of the slogans sought to rebut war supporters' arguments that the protests are unpatriotic. "We support our troops -- bring them home!" read one.  A former serviceman, Michael Schmidt of Peoria, Illinois, said: "It's up to me to help the US -- from here."  Others were more blunt, with one banner reading "Shocked, Awed -- and Disgusted."  One group, Lesbians Against Boys Invading Anything, carried signs saying "Pre-emptive war is terrorism," "This isn't the USA I love," and "Where Will the Bombs Fall Next?"  Up to 20,000 protesters thronged the plazas and streets of San Francisco, where more than 1,600 people were arrested in the past two days in a civil disobedience campaign.  Between 2,500 and 3,000 people picketed the CNN studios in Los Angeles while others at the Atlanta headquarters protested the cable network's coverage of the war for being biased toward the United States.  "They make this look like a John Wayne movie," said protester Elvis Woods. "You watch CNN and all you get are explosions and video of tanks and guns. Nobody questions whether this is right or not."  Counter-demonstrations in support of the US-led invasion of Iraq took place in some cities, with some 2,500 people turning out in Chicago. Flying the US flag and reciting the pledge of allegiance, they outnumbered their anti-war counterparts by three to one.  Passions ran deep on both sides, but a line of police in riot gear kept them apart. Carrying signs that said, "It's the oil, stupid," and "Real men don't bomb children," the anti-war protesters waved blue Earth flags.  "I agree Saddam is crazy and needs to go, but it's not our place to do it," said Ian Wisniewski, 14, who had a fake bullet hole painted on his forehead. "It's crazy that we're bombing Iraq. It sickens me."  A few yards away, Claire Tortorello, 54, pointed and yelled at the protesters across the plaza. Holding a framed picture of her son, serving with the Army's 3rd Infantry Division in Iraq, she said she didn't know whether he was dead or alive.  "I'm here to support him and others who are fighting for their country. They wouldn't be here if it weren't for the freedoms that others fought for," she said.  Anti-war protests took place around the world Saturday after the start of the bombing of Baghdad. Hundreds of thousands of demonstrators took to the streets in Britain, Spain and Italy, whose governments approved of the war.  In Montreal, "Stop the War," a coalition of more than 190 groups, said as many as 200,000 people turned out, though police refused to give a figure.  Protesters also gathered in their thousands in Halifax, Calgary, Edmonton and Vancouver.  Organizers of the civil disobedience campaigns promised to block intersections and bridges, shackle themselves to lampposts and create human cordons to snarl traffic, as long as the war continues.  Some 3,000 people have been arrested since the disobedience campaigns began last week.    .

   Indonesia delays execution of convicts including Indian on death row   JAKARTA, March 27 (AFP)  Indonesia will delay the execution of six convicts including an Indian on death row after five of them appealed to the Supreme Court for a second review, prosecutors said Thursday.  "If we execute them now we can't bring them to life again should their appeals for a review be granted," said Antasari Azhar, spokesman for the attorney general's office.  The Supreme Court rejected earlier appeals for a case review from five of the convicts. The sixth offender has only made one appeal for a review.  President Megawati Sukarnoputri has refused clemency for the six and asked for a speedy execution. Five of them are Indonesians convicted of murders while the other is an Indian drug offender, Ayodhya Prasad Chaubey.  "We are talking about someone's life or death so we have to be very careful," Azhar said.  A convict can file a case review or appeal for presidential clemency only after the Supreme Court upholds a sentence imposed by a lower court.  Apart from those convicted of murder, 16 people are on death row for drug trafficking -- 11 foreigners, four Indonesians and a Dutch citizen of Chinese-Indonesian origin.  Indonesian courts have increasingly handed out severe sentences, including death, for drug smugglers. Narcotics abuse is an increasingly serious problem in the country.  Amnesty International has appealed to Indonesia to spare the lives of convicted drug offenders and others, saying there was no proof the death penalty deters would-be traffickers more effectively than other punishments.  Amnesty opposes the death penalty for any crime.  Use of the death penalty is rare in Indonesia, where the last execution was carried out in May 2001 of two men convicted of a murder in 1989. It was the first execution for five years.  A police firing squad enforces the penalty.    .

   2,500 Japanese students in Osaka protest against Iraq war   TOKYO, March 30 (AFP)  Some 2,500 mainly university students formed a human chain in Japanese characters spelling out "No War" in Osaka on Sunday to protest against the ongoing US-led military campaign in Iraq.  "We cannot forgive this war," Miyako Fuji, 20, one of the rally's organisers told Jiji news agency. "I want to join together the feelings of each of us as individuals who oppose the war."  Protesters, who exceeded the 2,000 expected to show up at the park at Osaka Castle in the city's downtown neighbourhood, carried placards that read "Stop war" and "Love and Peace" while forming the human chain after 3:00 pm (0600 GMT), Jiji said.  The protest follows a string of others involving tens of thousands of peace activists across Japan since January.  According to a poll by Kyodo news agency released Saturday, 78 of 100 people surveyed opposed the military action in Iraq.  A separate poll of 1,846 adults by the leading Yomiuri newspaper published Tuesday showed 64 percent felt Japan had "no choice" but to back the United States, with only 12 percent saying Japan had "every reason" to back the war.    .

   Russia hints "peace camp" alliance with Germany and France is dying by Dmitry Zaks   MOSCOW, April 13 (AFP)  Russian President Vladimir Putin's summit with the leaders of Germany and France may have been a failure that proves there can be no long-term "peace camp" alliance following the end of war in Iraq, government sources were quoted as saying at the weekend.  "Senior government officials, speaking in the corridors of power in Moscow, have no illusions about any long-term perspectives for the (Russian-German-French) axis," the respected Izvestia daily reported.  "Sooner or later Iraq will fall and Russia and the United Sates will resume normal relations," the senior Moscow official, who was reported to be close to Putin, told the paper.  "The situation in Iraq does not mean that we intend to get into an argument with the United States."  The comments indicate that Russia's nuanced position over the war in Iraq was becoming ever more scrambled, with Putin pushing to protect his budding friendship with US President George W. Bush in the face of strident opposition from the Russian media and other top Kremlin officials.  Analysts have long argued that Putin is far keener to preserve friendly relations with the United States than the pro-European, anti-war camps embedded in much of the Russian media and the foreign and defense ministries.  Russia's foreign minister expressed outrage at suggestions from a top Washington official last week that Moscow should forgive the eight billion dollars in Soviet-era debt that Baghdad owes it, as a gesture of good will.  Kommersant business daily joined in, declaring in a furious front-page headline: "The United States is demanding that Russia, France and Germany pay for the Iraqi war."  And the popular Gazeta.ru news website stormed: "We should have expected this!.. This is only the start of a massive US campaign (to decide Iraq's future finances)."  Yet Putin has been far more reserved. He and his loyal finance minister suggested Friday that Moscow might be prepared to waiver some of the Iraqi debts in return for better Russia-US relations.  "On the whole the proposal is understandable and legitimate," Putin said. "Russia has no objections to such a proposal."  Putin concluded his two days of talks in Saint Petersburg with Jacques Chirac of France and German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder on Saturday still urging for a central role for the United Nations in a post-war revival of Iraq.  The call reflected the insistent demand made by the three leaders before the US-British invasion of Iraq that UN approval was essential for any mission to topple Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.  But the Saint Petersburg summit ended without any formal declaration on Iraq.  And diplomats noted that Putin appeared uncomfortable at being so closely associated with the anti-Washington stance of Schroeder and Chirac amid his developing friendship with Bush.  Putin had even secretly invited British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Bush's staunchest backer in the war on Iraq, to attend the pow-wow in Saint Petersburg's Grand Hotel Europe, although diplomats said Blair turned the offer down.  It remains to be seen how successful Putin's overtures to Washington will be in the face of the fervent internal hostility to the US war stance.  A senior lawmaker seen as close to the Kremlin ridiculed the United States Sunday for failing to find any weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.  "We do not think that America won," said Dmitry Rogozin, the head of the lower house of parliament's foreign affairs committee, told Rossia television.  "Where are those chemical weapons?" he demanded.  And Putin's media aide, Sergei Yastrzhembsky, told Kommersant Russia would not forgive the Iraqi debt.  "(Washington) should not be so generous at other people's expense," he said.    .

   Three hacked to death in India over witchcraft allegations   GUWAHATI, India, April 17 (AFP)  At least three members of a family in Indias northeastern state of Tripura were hacked to death by a tribal mob for allegedly practicing witchcraft, police said Thursday.  A spokesman said a group of 25 to 30 armed men Wednesday attacked a house belonging to a village quack doctor in Tultuli, 60 kilometers (38 miles) south of Tripuras state capital Agartala.  "The mob dragged out three members of a family and (killed) them with machetes and spears before fleeing the area," the spokesman said by telephone from Agartala.  The dead included the quack doctor, 55-year-old Nityalila Naotia, his teenaged son and another member of the family, whom he did not identify.  "It was believed Naotia was a practicing sorcerer and through his black magic he had cast evil spells on villagers, prompting a group within the village to eliminate them," the spokesman said.  Police have arrested four people in connection with the killings.  Superstitious beliefs, black magic and demonology are integral to the tribal custom in parts of Tripura and other northeast Indian states.  Many tribes practice faiths believed to be a mix of black magic and superstition.    .

   Russia misplayed Iraq hand, but damage to US relations not fatal: analysts by Dmitry Zaks   MOSCOW, April 17 (AFP)  Silence is golden -- especially when your hand is weak -- top Moscow policy analysts said in an assessment of the fallout from Russia's vocal opposition to what turned out to be a swift US-led campaign in Iraq.  Several top diplomacy experts told a Kremlin-run forum that countries like China and India that said little about the conflict before its March 20 launch were already reaping the benefits.  Some suggested that Russian President Vladimir Putin will now be scrambling to contain the damage to his once-budding friendship with US President George W. Bush because he was poorly advised by his intelligence and defense aides.  One analyst said China -- which like Russia and France wields a UN Security Council veto but never threatened to use it to prevent the war -- recently won its role as chief mediator between the United States and North Korea because other regional powers' confidence in Russia fell as a result of its Iraqi diplomacy.  "We are losing our positions in Asia because ... this failure of a strategic triangle that (Foreign Minister Igor) Ivanov invented with Germany and France," fumed Andrei Piontkovsky of Moscow's Center of Strategic Studies.  Negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang on their nuclear dispute have been set for April 23 in Bejing and are widely seen here as a blow to Moscow efforts to stamp authority on the region by organizing such a meeting.  Meanwhile the European "peace camp" troika finds itself in tricky diplomatic isolation from Washington.  French President Jacques Chirac received only a reserved response when he tried to mend fences by placing a telephone call Tuesday to Bush.  Meanwhile German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has not spoken to Bush since several weeks before the start of the war.  But not everyone here agreed that Moscow's diplomatic relations with Washington had suffered as badly.  Most agreed that Russian diplomacy miscalculated and urged Putin to quickly reassess the quality of his advisers.  "Our analysis of foreign policy is lacking and often reverts to Cold War stereotypes," said former deputy foreign minister Anatoly Adamishin.  "We were so proud of forming an antiwar bloc with France and Germany -- but nations have not been forming such blocs for at least 12 years and someone in Moscow should have understood that it was impossible to avert this war."  "Our main goal now is to make sure that our relations with the United States do not suffer further -- and I think this is possible."  US diplomats have hinted in recent weeks that Washington's anger with European resistance to the campaign was focused more on Paris -- and to a lesser extent Berlin -- than it was with Moscow.  Putin last spoke to Bush on April 5 at the US president's own initiative. They are scheduled to meet next in the Russian leader's native city of Saint Petersburg in late May.  "We lost nothing and won nothing -- this was not our war," said liberal lawmaker Irina Khakamada of the Union of Rightist Forces.  "We showed the Americans that we would not give up on our position in Iraq cheaply and we did not. We should continue sticking to our principles."  Khakamada argued that the United States would also need Russia's help "to make the new Iraqi government seem legitimate."  Most analysts linked Russia's opposition to a war in Iraq to fears that it will lose oil contracts that were sealed with the now-toppled regime of Saddam Hussein.  The floodgates of Iraqi oil are also now likely to open to world markets and hurt Russia's budget revenues -- which are heavily reliant on revenues from its own energy exports.  But few at the Kremlin forum suggested that Putin's own standing among voters will be hurt by Russia's apparent diplomacy failures.  Putin will face re-election in March 2004 and analysts noted that the war -- while opposed by most Russians -- was never turned by the Kremlin into a matter of national security.  "I do not think that this will affect the elections unless Russia's failure in Iraq is presented as an issue of national security -- and has not been yet," said Viktor Kuvaldin of a research center funded by former Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev.    .

   Malaysia's Anwar loses appeal in sodomy case ATTENTION - ADDS Anwar quote, backround ///   KUALA LUMPUR, April 18 (AFP)  Malaysia's Appeal Court Friday refused to overturn the conviction and nine-year jail sentence imposed on ex-deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim for sodomy.  Anwar, 56, who this week completed four years in prison on a corruption charge, now faces an earliest possible release date of April 14, 2009 if he is given one third remission of his sentence for good behaviour.  The former heir-apparent to Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who says he was framed for political reasons, told reporters after his appeal was rejected: "You must remember its pre-selected judges, most junior of the court of appeal, and its all scripted.  "What do you expect?"  Mahathir's sacking of the charismatic and popular Anwar in September 1998 rocked Malaysian politics, with thousands of people taking to the streets to demonstrate their support for him.  Within weeks he was arrested and charged with sodomising an official driver several years previously and with abusing his powers to cover up the offence.  The conduct of the trials was widely criticised internationally and the United States still lists Anwar as a political prisoner.  Anwar was told Monday that he had been granted a standard one-third remission of a six-year corruption sentence for good behaviour, and immediately began to serve the nine-year sentence for sodomy.    .

   "Jurassic Park" creator Crichton agrees to pay ex-wife 31 million dollars   LOS ANGELES, April 18 (AFP)  Best-selling novelist and "Jurassic Park" creator Michael Crichton has agreed to pay his fourth wife 31 million dollars as part of their divorce settlement, court documents showed Friday.  Crichton, 60, is one of the world's wealthiest authors, and has had 12 of his novels made into major Hollywood movies.  The writer will retain the rights to his books and films, although he has agreed to split a raft of other possessions with Anne Marie, his wife of 13 years, according to documents filed in Los Angeles Superior Court.  Anne-Marie will get the couple's 19-room home in New York state, which was on the  market last year for 21.5 million dollars, as well as their fine art collection.  Crichton, a Harvard Medical School graduate, will keep a home in Hawaii and four cars, while the couple, who also each have homes in Los Angeles, will share custody of their 15-year-old daughter, Taylor.  Before the divorce, Crichton's fortune was estimated at 65 million dollars, built on such hit novels as "The Andromeda Strain," "The Great American Train Robbery" and "Westworld" and his hit television series "ER."  According to one report, he received 3.5 million dollars for the film rights to his latest book, "Prey," and has a 30-million-dollar, two-book deal with publishers Harper Collins.  Anne-Marie sued Crichton for divorce in September after their marriage broke down.  In December, Chinese archaeologists named a new species of dinosaur after the "Jurassic Park" author.    .

   North Korea nuclear bombshell sparks alarm, appeals for calm by Charles Whelan = (PICTURE, GRAPHIC) =   SEOUL, April 25 (AFP)  US allegations that North Korea admitted to possessing nuclear weapons triggered alarm across Asia Friday and prompted appeals for calm from world capitals.  The admission, according to US sources, came during three-day talks in Beijing which concluded Friday, the first meeting between US and North Korean officials since the nuclear crisis erupted six months ago.  China expressed hopes that both sides would keep the dialogue alive while officials in Moscow and London called for patience in resolving the complex impasse.  South Korea and Japan were cautious, with Seoul Foreign Minister Yoon Young-Kwan saying if the North Koreans were telling the truth, it would represent a "major" threat to peace in Northeast Asia.  US sources with authoritative knowledge of the Beijing meetings said the head of the North Korean delegation Li Gun had confirmed to US envoy James Kelly that the Stalinist state had developed nuclear weapons and hinted it may sell or use them, depending on US actions.  "They said what we always knew, that they do have weapons," one US source said. "That doesn't shock us, we have been saying it. Now they have said it."  Li also told Kelly that North Korea had gone ahead with reprocessing 8,000 spent fuel rods at its Yongbyon plant, which could produce enough weapons grade plutonium for several more nuclear bombs, said the sources who requested anonymity.  An angry US President George W. Bush accused Pyongyang of reverting to blackmail following the nuclear admission and North Korea fired back with a charge that Washington had rejected a "bold" plan to resolve the six-month-old impasse.  The outcome of the talks plunged financial markets into freefall in Seoul with analysts saying they saw no sign of a recovery any time soon.  Despite the leaked details about the meetings, US officials publicly declined to confirm any of North Korea's announcements, with US State Department spokesman Richard Boucher saying comments made by North Koreans "require careful analysis."  China, playing host to the talks, tried to put a positive spin on the talks which Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing said signified "a good beginning."  "We hope that all sides can continue to make efforts to peacefully resolve the Korean nuclear issue," Li was quoted by the official Xinhua news agency as saying.  He said Korean nuclear issue was "very complicated and sensitive," but the key was to "not mind the other side's rhetoric," but "pay attention to its actions."  A top Russian foreign ministry official called for patience and Britain's Foreign Secretary Jack Straw echoed the call in a BBC radio interview.  Kelly, the US assistant secretary for East Asia and Pacific Affairs, arrived in Seoul from Beijing Friday to brief Yoon, the foreign minister.  "If it is true that North Korea possesses nuclear weapons, this would be a major breach of peace on the Korean peninsula as well as in Northeast Asia," said Yoon.  Kelly, who declined to talks to reporters here, travels to Tokyo Sunday for talks with Japanese officials. He has made no public comments so far on the Beijing talks.  However US Secretary of State Colin Powell said the talks had featured "strong views" on all sides and insisted that the United States would not bow to blackmail, threats or "bellicose statements."  North Korea, in its first official comment on the outcome of the talks, accused Washington of ruling out Pyongyang's "bold" plan for peace while offering nothing new itself.  A North Korean foreign ministry spokesman, quoted by the official Korean Central News Agency, made no reference to the reports that North Korea had admitted to possessing nuclear weapons.  "At the talks the DPRK (North Korea) set forth a new bold proposal to clear up bilateral concerns of the DPRK and the US, and the parties concerned with the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, at the same  "The US, however, repeated its old assertion that the DPRK should 'scrap its nuclear program before dialogue' without advancing any new proposal at the talks."  The official did not disclose what North Korea's bold plan was.    .

   Pakistani Christian gets life imprisonment for blasphemy   MULTAN, Pakistan, April 27 (AFP)  A Pakistani court in central Punjab province has sentenced a Christian man to life imprisonment for a blasphemy conviction, police said Sunday.  Judge Shahid Rafiq, of the district court in the industrial city of Faisalabad, found Ranjha Masih guilty of defiling Koranic verses during a protest rally by the minority Christian community in 1998.  In a verdict handed down on Saturday, the judge also ordered Ranjha to pay a fine of 50,000 rupees (about 870 US dollars), they said.  Ranjha was accused of tearing down a billboard carrying verses from the Koran in Faisalabad during a Christian demonstration after the city's bishop committed suicide over the 1985 blasphemy law.  Faisalabad's Catholic Bishop John Joseph, who had been campaigning against the law, shot himself in the head outside a court in Sahiwal district when the judge convicted Christian Ayub Masih under the law in 1998.  Ayub Masih was charged in 1996 with blasphemy for allegedly defending British author Salman Rushdie, whose novel "The Satanic Verses" infuriated radical Mulsim clerics who accused the author of defaming Islam.  The Pakistani supreme court last year aquitted Ayub Masih, who had denied uttering any word against Islam or the Prophet Mohammad.  Blasphemy is punishable by death under the Pakistan Penal Code. However, no blasphemy convict has ever been executed in the country.  Christian rights activists campaigning against the laws, introduced by late military dictator General Zia-ul Haq, say they are mainly used to persecute Christians or to settle feuds over land.    .

   NKorea offers to scrap nuke, missile programs but wants big concessions: US  by Matthew Lee  ATTENTION - UPDATES ///  WASHINGTON, April 28 (AFP) - North Korea has offered to scrap its nuclear weapons and missile programs, but only in return for "considerable" diplomatic, political and economic concessions, the United States said Monday.  Secretary of State Colin Powell said the offer was made during three-way talks between US, North Korean and Chinese diplomats last week in Beijing.  At the same meeting Pyongyang confirmed it had nuclear weapons, and threatened to prove it with a "display."  "The North Koreans acknowledged a number of things that they were doing and, in effect, said that these are now up for further discussion," he told reporters at the State Department.  "They did put forward a plan that would ultimately deal with their nuclear capability and their missile activities, but they, of course, expect something considerable in return," Powell said.  "We are studying that plan, we are examining it with our friends and allies," Powell said, adding that talks were now underway with the South Korean, Japanese, Russian and Australian as well as other governments.  "It was useful to get it all out on the table and see where we go from here," he said, referring to the April 23 to 25 discussions in Beijing.  Powell gave no indication as to whether Washington would accept the offer, and did not address what Pyongyang was demanding in terms of concesssions.  However other US officials said the North Koreans had presented a lengthy list of demands.  The demands include full normalization of ties with the United States, security guarantees and economic assistance that include oil and other energy considerations.  "They had quite a list of things," State Department spokesman Richard Boucher told reporters.  Asked specifically about normalization of relations and economic assistance, Boucher replied: "I don't really quibble with that characterization of the list."  A senior State Department official said later that the list of demands was so extensive that it defied a "concise description."  "It basically listed everything they have ever asked for," the official told reporters on condition of anonymity, identifying oil and energy supplies as demands.  Although the North Korean demands are being looked at, Boucher repeated long-standing US policy that Washington would not be blackmailed or otherwise threatened into buying Pyongyang off.  "We've made clear we're not going to pay for elimination of the nuclear weapons programs that never should have begun in the first place," he said.  Powell acknowledged that North Korea had hinted it could prove it possessed nuclear weapons with some sort of display during the Beijing talks, but maintained that the North Koreans had not used the words "test" or "testing."  "They said that it is the kind of capability that one can display in one way or another," he said.  The concessions demanded by Pyongyang were part of a "bold" proposal for addressing the nuclear situation on the Korean peninsula that North Korea presented in Beijing, officials said.  South Korean newspapers reported earlier Monday that the North suggested that Pyongyang and Washington act simultaneously and equally to resolve the six-month-old nuclear crisis.  Boucher ruled out simultaneous steps by both sides, stressing that Washington would not consider such moves until the "verifiable and irreversible termination" of the north's nuclear programs.  "We (have) made clear that once North Korea did that, we could move on or move back to the comprehensive approach to US-North Korea relations that we had talked about before," he said.  South Korea's Munhwa Ilbo newspapers and others quoted unnamed South Korean government sources as saying Pyongyang also urged Washington not to hinder its efforts to establish and improve ties with Seoul and Tokyo.  The North's ruling Workers Party newspaper, Rodong Sinmun, indicated Sunday that North Korea wanted economic and political "rewards" from the United States in return for the elimination of its nuclear program.  Rodong called for a "fair and equal" footing in talks with the United States, blasting Washington for insisting that there would be "no security of the system nor provision of rewards" even if Pyongyang gave up its nuclear program.  It insisted North Korea could do "everything" to defend itself if the United States "legally guarantees no use of arms including nukes".    .

   South Korea's ruling party faces call for dissolution   SEOUL, April 29 (AFP)  South Korea's ruling party is facing an internal reformist call for dissolving itself to create a new group after a humiliating defeat at last week's by-elections, party officials said Tuesday.  The ruling Millennium Democratic Party (MDP), founded by former president Kim Dae-Jung, has suffered declining popularity since President Roh Moo-Hyun took office in February.  A group of 18 reformist MDP lawmakers, mostly Roh's confidants, demanded late Wednesday that the party be "constructively dissolved" to create a new grouping, MDP officials said.  But the established MDP leadership has opposed the sudden overhaul, they added.  Reformist MDP members, however, vowed to launch a preparatory committee next month and to make "tangible progress" in the process of forging a new party.  The internal dispute erupted after the MDP lost three parliamentary seats in Thursday's by-elections.  The opposition Grand National Party (GNP) took two of the National Assembly seats while a splinter reformist party got the third.  With the latest wins, the GNP increased its majority in the 272-seat National Assembly to 153 seats against 101 for the MDP.  General elections are due in April next year.    .

   Australia's first listed bordello plans sex Disneyland   SYDNEY, April 30 (AFP)  The Daily Planet Ltd, about to become the first brothel to list on the Australian Stock Exchange, plans to follow up its May Day launching by opening a "sex Disneyland" here, the Melbourne-based bordello announced Wednesday.  Chief executive Andrew Harris said the company was likely to abandon plans to acquire a hotel in Sydney's Kings Cross red light district and acquire another property three times the size in a better location.  The Daily Planet raised 3.5 million dollars (2.2 million US) in its initial public offering with one of the new 600 shareholders acquiring 1.0 million dollars worth of shares.  Renowned Hollywood madam Heidi Fleiss has been flown to Melbourne as guest of honour at Thursday's market debut and, according to Harris, has already played a key role in attracting worldwide media attention to the event.  "Heidi's ideas, her background, her knowledge have helped us a great deal," he said. "The international novelty value with Heidi promoting it has been massive -- these shares can go anywhere."  But it hasn't been an easy road to the Australian Stock Exchange since the idea was first mooted in 1994.  "The establishment did not want a brothel on the stock exchange," Harris said.  "It's only because we were the biggest and the best that we could afford to do it.  "We have fought every institution, every law firm ... it's cost us a fortune but now we're going on a massive expansion."  Harris said Sydney was a more attractive option for the sex Disneyland because its prostitution laws are less restrictive than Melbourne's.  "Prostitution is completely decriminalised in Sydney and we are going to build a monster," he said.  "We want a complete one-stop adult venue -- we want a complete adult venue with adult cinemas, adult shops... we have found much bigger premises in a much better location to create a sex Disneyland."  The company is also considering franchising The Daily Planet within Australia with likely venues in Perth, Brisbane, Sydney's western suburbs and a second venue in Melbourne.  But The Daily Planet is saving its big plans for the United States where it is negotiating with two well-known US personalities to join the board.  "The United States is our major thrust," he said. "We want to build a little city called Metropolis with a 150-200 room hotel in Nevada."    .

   Troubled French media group Vivendi set to sell theme parks: report   LOS ANGELES, May 2 (AFP)  Beleaguered French media group Vivendi Universal is in advanced negotiations to sell its theme park business to a US firm for around 1.5 billion dollars, the Los Angeles Times said Friday.  The report came as the indebted group said it was planning to sell off its US unit Vivendi Universal Entertainment and other assets, to focus on its telecoms activities and its French cable television business.  The Times said Vivendi Universal was negotiating to sell its flagship theme parks to New York investment firm Blackstone Group as a the first step toward dismantling its entertainment empire.  Vivendi Universal officials in the United States were not immediately available for comment on Friday.  Under the reported plans, Blackstone Group would buy Vivendi's theme park division, including Universal Studios Hollywood, Universal Orlando in Florida and Universal's ownership interests in parks in Spain and Japan, a source close to the negotiations told the paper.  Blackstone already holds a 50 percent stake in the two parks that make up Universal Orlando.  Vivendi earlier this week confirmed months of press speculation that it planned to shed its entertainment assets by the end of the year, including its famed Universal movie studio and television assets.  Chief executive Jean-Rene Fourtou told shareholders at the group's annual general meeting Tuesday that the sale of Vivendi Universal Entertainment was a major goal for 2003, and that negotiations were already under way.  However, Fourtou said he had not yet received any firm offer for its giant US music business, Universal Music Group, and had taken no final decision over its future.  The group, once a French utilities company, needs to reshape itself in order to slash its huge debt burden of around 18 billion dollars.  In 2002, the group recorded a net loss of 23.3 billion euros -- the biggest ever in France -- on sales of 28.7 billion.    .

   Budget cinema launched by eastJet founder finally gets some films   LONDON, May 9 (AFP)  A ground-breaking British budget cinema chain launched by the founder of low-cost airline easyJet announced Friday that it had finally acquired some films to show -- just a fortnight before it first opens.  EasyCinema, which aims to sell tickets to its no-frills cinemas for as little as 20 pence (0.28 euros, 0.32 dollars), has been locked in a bitter battle with film distributors over how it wants to pay for titles.  Rather than splitting ticket sales with distributors, easyCinema wants to pay a fixed fee for rights to show first-run movies over a fixed period, a proposal thus far rejected by the film majors.  EasyCinema founder Stelios Haji-Ioannou, who set up easyJet in 1995 and built it up into Europe's biggest budget airline, has vowed to take legal action against the distribution firms unless they allow him access.  The deadlock, and subsequent lack of any films, has been threatening to de-rail the debut of easyCinema's first outlet in Milton Keynes, just north of London, which is due to open its doors on May 23.  However the firm announced on Friday that it had reached a deal with the British arm of French distributors Pathe to show four releases.  While not the latest Hollywood blockbusters, these include titles such as as recently-released US martial arts picture "Bulletproof Monk" and new British 1930s-based weepie "The Heart of Me".  Haji-Ioannou professed himself "delighted", but promised to push ahead in his battle with other distributors.  "The situation with the top six UK distributors representing more than 90 percent of the market is still in a deadlock," he said.  "I have instructed my lawyers to discuss this issue with the Office of Fair Trading."  EasyCinema aims to make its money by drawing the public in with rock-bottom prices during off-peak hours, when traditional cinemas are often almost empty, also giving the biggest discounts to tickets bought long in advance.  To cut costs, all booking is done via the Internet and the pared-down cinemas have no popcorn stalls and skeleton staff.    .

   Israeli FM meets Qatari counterpart in Paris   PARIS, May 14 (AFP)  Israeli Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom on Wednesday stressed Qatar's role in the Middle East peace process during talks with his Qatari counterpart Sheikh Hamad bin Jassem bin Jabr al-Thani in Paris.  Shalom told a joint press conference that the tiny Gulf state's strong relationship with the recently appointed Palestinian prime minister, Mahmud Abbas, could be a boost for peace.  "We discussed the Middle East peace process. Over an hour of talks, we asserted the will of both parties (Israel and the Arab world) to do everything to return to the negotiating table," Shalom said.  "Qatar is a very important country on this issue. I know the special relationship that the Qatari foreign minister has with Abu Mazen," he said, using Abbas's alternative name.  The meeting was Shalom's first encounter with an Arab counterpart since he took office as Israel's foreign minister on February 27.  Qatar has economic links with Israel without maintaining diplomatic relations, in the face of criticism from other Arab countries.  Afterwards Shalom was to fly on to London for talks with British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Foreign Secretary Jack Straw.    .

   MCI to pay huge fine to SEC for accounting fraud: report   WASHINGTON, May 19 (AFP)  MCI, formerly WorldCom, and the Securities and Exchange Commission have reached a final agreement in the telecom giant's 11-billion-dollar (9.4-billion-euro) fraud case, The Wall Street Journal reported Monday.  Under terms of the agreement, to be submitted as early as Monday to a judge presiding over the case, MCI would agree to pay the largest fine imposed so far by the SEC on a company that is not a broker-dealer, the Journal said, citing sources close to the matter.  The report did not give the amount of the fine, but said it would be "exponentially larger" than the historic 10 million dollars Xerox paid the SEC last year.  Last month, the SEC slapped fines totaling 1.4 billion dollars on 10 Wall Street brokerages to settle charges of conflicts of interest between analysts and investors.  MCI and the SEC negotiated the agreement for months after a partial settlement in November under which MCI, formerly known as WorldCom, agreed not to mislead investors about its finances, and to improve internal controls, the Journal said.  The estimated value of the fraud has reached historic proportions, swelling from the initially announced 3.5 million dollars to 11 million dollars as revelations of misconduct piled on, the report said.  Separately, former WorldCom CEO Bernard Ebbers failed on April 29 to make a first repayment of 25 million dollars, plus interest, on a 400-million-dollar loan from MCI, the Journal said, citing SEC documents.  Because he is now in default MCI must now seize additional assets owned by Ebbers, to secure the loan. The company has already sold his Georgia-based yacht building business for 15 million dollars, and is close to selling his ranch in British Colombia, which is expected to bring 60 to 70 million dollars, the Journal said.    .

   Shiites openly mark Mohammed's birthday in Iraq as lawlessness still reigns = (PICTURES) =   BAGHDAD, May 19 (AFP)  Shiite Muslims in Iraq Monday celebrated openly for the first time in decades Prophet Mohammed's birthday, as continuing anarchy and chaos threatened to undermine US efforts to rebuild the war-ravaged country.  Meanwhile coalition officials in Iraq insisted plans for an Iraqi government were still on track and Russia hinted that a compromise could be imminent on a UN draft resolution to lift economic sanctions on Iraq.  Thousands of Iraq's majority Shiite Muslims marched to their main mosque in Baghdad to mark the birthday of Islam's founder Prophet Mohammed.  Shiites, who celebrate the birthday a week later than Sunni Muslims, were forbidden to publicly mark the date under the regime of Saddam Hussein's Sunni-dominated regime.  The crowd filled the street leading to the Kazimiya mosque in the northeast of Baghdad and carried banners in the green color of Islam, calling for good government.  "No to injustice," "No to occupation," "No to Israel," "Yes to Islam," chanted the demonstrators as speeches began from a platform.  Imam Mohammad al-Fartussi, who last week threatened violence against "sinful" women, alcohol vendors and cinemas showing "indecent" films, offered praise for the fall of Saddam and called Iraq "the land of imams... land of Islam."  The demonstration came as Iraq's top US overseer Paul Bremer began his second week on the job amid continuing lawlessness in the country.  In his frenzied first seven days, the telegenic Bremer repeatedly promised to restore the law and order that crumbled along with Saddam Hussein's regime nearly six weeks ago.  But despite issuing a host of tough decrees, Bremer has failed to stem the rampant crime and street violence plaguing the country.  Despite a security crackdown over the weekend in Baghdad and an announcement that some 7,000 policemen had returned to their jobs since the end of the war, ordinary Iraqis still felt unsafe on the street with gunfire rife and police a near invisible presence.  In Baghdad, almost all the police stations have been destroyed or looted since US troops took control of the capital on April 9. Only two have so far reopened, and they have no equipment whatsoever. Baghdad's top police job remains vacant.  And a trip to Baghdad's looter market only bears witness to the fact that criminals are ruling the roost in the post-Saddam era.  Packed with the piles of stolen goods picked up during the frenzy of theft that followed the collapse of Saddam's regime, the traders deal in everything from computers and stereos to furniture and weapons.  Jalal Jamil, a 45-year-old jewellery store owner, said the situation just keeps getting worse. "The Americans encourage people to steal because when looting happens right under their noses they do nothing," he said.  Bremer has also been criticized for backing away from an earlier US officials Monday insisted government plans were still on track.  "We want to have an Iraqi voice in everything we do here but it would be wrong to do that precipitously," said a source at the Organisation of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance (ORHA), which is administering post-war Iraq.  Officials from Iraqi groups that met with Bremer last week have said that he back peddled on what they said were earlier pledges to give them a lead role in forming a new interim government in the next few weeks.  "We understand that they want to have as much power as possible but we told them: 'You won't be directly elected, you won't have any direct experience of government," the source said.  "'Of course you will have input into the government but, since you are not directly elected, it would be a nonsense for you to have direct executive power,' the source said.  "The last thing we want is to leave a bunch of self-appointed oligarchs in power," the source said.  The comments came on the same day that a prominent Iraqi called for internationally-supervised elections in Iraq.  Adnan Pachachi, a onetime foreign minister who returned to Iraq on May 6 after 33 years in exile, told the independent Az-Zaman daily that elections should be held under international supervision.  An interim government should create an election code and laws to clear the way for direct elections to a constituent assembly, that would draw up a constitution, Pachachi said.  A referendum on the constitution would lead to elections for a new government, the 80-year-old Pachachi told the daily.  On the diplomatic front, a top Russian official said Monday that the UN Security Council would likely vote this week on a US-British draft resolution to lift economic sanctions placed on Iraq in 1990 after its invasion of Kuwait and to place its oil riches under coalition control for at least a year.  "An updated text of the document may already be published today and may be put to a vote this week," Deputy Foreign Minister Yury Fedotov told ITAR-TASS news agency.  Yet Fedotov did not say whether Russia would back the resolution, which diplomats have been revising since the United States, Britain and Spain first submitted it more than a week ago.  Russia "will vote depending on what the resolution text turns out to be," he said.  With billions of dollars in oil and debt interests in Iraq, Russia has been anxious to secure UN involvement before supporting the resolution.  Australia announced the creation Monday of an expert panel to help Iraq protect its rich cultural heritage and assist Interpol in recovering looted ancient artefacts.    .

   Bush looking forward to seeing Chretien at G8   WASHINGTON, May 27 (AFP)  US President George W. Bush told Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien by telephone Monday that he looked forward to seeing him at the upcoming summit of major industrialized nations and Russia, the White House said Tuesday.  "The two leaders discussed the upcoming G-8 meeting, US-Canada (relations) and other international issues of concern," Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer said days before the June 1-3 summit, to be held in France.  "Both said they look forward to seeing each other in Evian. They also touched on Afghanistan, the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo and on the global economy," said Fleischer.  Amid a chill in relations over the war in Iraq, which Canada opposed, Bush indefinitely postponed a visit to Canada, instead choosing to host Australian Prime Minster John Howard, who endorsed that military campaign.  On Monday, Chretien told reporters that he and Bush, who had not spoken since late February, discussed a wide range of issues, including Iraq, the upcoming summit of the Group of Eight industrial powers and aid to Africa.  "We've always been on good terms. We just disagree on one item," the Canadian leader said.    .

   Singapore doctors to perform risky operation on Iranian twins   SINGAPORE, May 30 (AFP)  Singapore doctors will proceed with an unpredecented and risky operation to separate a pair of adult Iranian twins joined at the head, a hospital official said Friday.  The official, who asked not to be named, said the decision to go ahead with the operation is expected to be announced to the media on Monday by doctors and executives of Raffles Hospital, where the surgery will be carried out.  A team of specialists here have been conducting tests on the female twins, Laleh and Ladan Bijani, since last year to determine if the operation can be successful.  The twins, both qualified lawyers aged in their late 20s, are joined at the head and the operation involves separating two individually functioning brains encased within a single bony structure, neurosurgeon Keith Goh said in December.  The pair flew to Singapore last year after hearing of the successful surgery on Nepalese babies Ganga and Jamuna Shrestha, who were separated in a 97-hour operation at a hospital here.  Attempts by Laleh and Ladan to have their operation elsewhere in the world were rejected, with doctors in Germany saying one or both of them could die.    .

   India's bachelor PM, president making country "dry, arid, infertile"   NEW DELHI, June 7 (AFP)  A provincial chief from India's main opposition Congress party has told an election rally that India is suffering nature's "curse" because both the president and prime minister are bachelors, a report said Saturday.  The Times of India newspaper quoted Digvijay Singh, chief minister of the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh, as saying that Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee and President Abdul Kalam had offended the Hindu rain God Varuna by remaining bachelors.  "The country is being ruled by a bachelor president and an unmarried prime minister. This according to the Hindu shastras (books) is very inauspicious and that is the reason there is a widespread heatwave and drought," said Singh.  "Not just Prime Minister Vajpayee but President Kalam's bachelor status is making the country dry, arid and infertile," he added.  The general secretary of Vajpayee's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, Pramod Mahajan, retorted that Singh's statement was "beneath contempt."  India's has been reeling under a heatwave since mid-May which has killed 1,403 people. The country's western desert state of Rajasthan is also bracing for its fifth straight year of drought.    .

   Mother held after a second baby found dead in Wisconsin   MADISON, Wisconsin, June 16 (AFP)  The skeleton of a second baby has been found at a rural Wisconsin home where a 22-year-old woman's dead infant was discovered in a blue plastic container June 8, officials said Monday.  Kristin Scott, the mother, told police she gave birth secretly to both babies at her parents' home in Byrds Creek, Richland County, one of unknown sex in April 2001 and the other, a fullterm girl, January 14.  Police arrested her in Abilene, Texas, Saturday where she had moved with a friend June 2.  She is being held on 50,000 dollars bail on a charge of first-degree reckless homicide and hiding a corpse in the death of the infant born in January.  Scott told police she did not tend to the baby, and it died after 30 minutes. She said the baby had to die, according to the criminal complaint.  The woman's parents, William and Nancy Scott, found the decomposing body of the first baby in her closet after they went looking for the source of a foul odor in their house.  Scott told investigators she had moved that body around before she moved to Texas, sometimes in the closet at the Byrds Creek house, in the trunk of her car and in the closet of her apartment in Richland Center, the complaint said.  The sheriff released no other details about the second baby.    .

   Rachel Hunter seeks divorce from pop icon Rod Sewart -- finally   LOS ANGELES, June 17 (AFP)  Supermodel Rachel Hunter on Tuesday filed for divorce from her estranged rocker husband Rod Stewart, four years after the couple separated, court papers showed.  Hunter, 34, filed for divorce in Los Angeles Superior Court, citing irreconcilable differences with the 58-year-old rock star to whom she has been married for nearly 13 years.  How the assets of the couple -- they have a daughter, Renee, 11, and a son, Liam, 8 -- will divided has yet to be decided, the documents showed.  The celebrity couple spit up very publicly four years ago and each has since had well-publicized relationships with others.  New Zealand-born Hunter reportedly had a fling with British pop star Robbie Williams, while British star Stewart has been much photographed with his reported girlfriend, blond photographer Penny Lancaster.  Stewart has said that after two failed marriages, he felt it unrealistic to expect couples to commit to each other for life and suggested that the words "til death do us part" should be removed from the wedding ceremony.  Stewart's 1979 marriage to Alana Hamilton lasted five years and produced two children.  The raspy-voiced singer who once dated Britt Ekland is best known for hit songs including "Maggie May," "Do Ya Think I'm Sexy," "Tonight's the Night" and "Young Turks".    .

   Israel hands over Rafah border crossing to Palestinians ATTENTION - RECASTS with return to pre-intifada positions, ADDS details ///   GAZA CITY, June 30 (AFP)  Palestinian security forces returned Monday to the positions they held in the Gaza Strip before the outbreak of the 33-month Palestinian uprising as Israel removed all major checkpoints in the coastal territory, a Palestinian security source said.  Police officers took up their positions across the Gaza Strip, enjoying a freedom of movement they have not known since the intifada exploded in September 2000, the source said.  "Palestinian police have taken over all the posts and positions they held before September 28, 2000. It is the first time they have had freedom of movement with cars and weapons since the start of the intifada," the source said.  The move marked a huge step forward in carrying out the US-backed Middle East "roadmap", which aims to end the months of bloodshed and create a lasting peace between Israel and the Palestinians.  Following the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the northern town of Beit Hanoun late Sunday, police took up positions there and in the neighbouring town of Beit Lahiya, he said.  They also deployed along the border with Israel. The handover is a credibility test for the Palestinian Authority, which must show it means business when it comes to reining in hardline groups plotting attacks on the Jewish state.  In another first in the almost three-year intifada, the Israeli army allowed Palestinians free circulation on the trans-Gaza highway as troops abandoned three major checkpoints across the coastal territory.  Traffic was flowing freely through the Netzarim junction, just south of Gaza City, the Kissufim junction by Deir al-Balah in the central Gaza Strip, and the Guest House junction just south of Deir al-Balah after the army withdrew.  The three military checkpoints on the highway, which runs the entire length of the Gaza Strip, had transformed the trip from north to south, ordinarily a 30-minute ride, into a grinding two or three-hour ordeal and came to symbolise the horrors of occupation.  "Israel has implemented most of the agreement except for a few issues," the source said, pointing out that Israel had still not removed two military observation posts at the Kissufim junction and the Guest House junction.  Although there was free movement along the trans-Gaza highway, several other roads remained temporarily closed, he said.  The Karni-Netzarim road, which runs east-to-west across the route, was still closed as was the section of the highway passing close by Kfar Darom settlement, just south of the Guest House junction, he said, adding both were likely to be opened in the coming weeks.  Another road, leading from the southern border town of Rafah to Khan Yunis, would be opened within 10 days, he said.  Adressing Palestinian complaints, an Israeli military source confirmed troops had installed a gate at the Netzarim crossing and at the southern Guest House junction but said that they were only there for when Jewish settlers needed to use the road.  A ban on Palestinian men under the age of 35 being allowed to move freely was still in force but that was expected to be lifted later on Monday or early Tuesday.  The army also handed over control of Rafah border crossing between the Gaza Strip and Egypt to the Palestinians, security sources said.  Six Palestinian police officers were allowed to return to the Palestinian section of the border crossing, which had been taken over by Israeli troops shortly after the start of the uprising.  Under the 1993 Oslo accords, which granted a measure of autonomy to the Palestinians, the Rafah border crossing with Egypt was to be jointly managed by both Israel and the Palestinians, although Israel had final control over the zone.  Although the crossing has, in principle, been open for movement between the two territories -- while being frequently closed by Israeli for reasons rarely explained -- the Palestinian section has been manned by Israel for more than two years.    .

   White House raises possibility it might not seek U.N. vote With EU-GEN--Turkey-US-Iraq; UN-GEN--N-Iraq   WASHINGTON (AP)  With opposition hardening, the White House left open the possibility Tuesday that it would not seek a United Nations vote on its war-making resolution if the measure was headed for defeat.  ``The vote is desirable. It is not necessary,'' presidential spokesman Ari Fleischer said.  The comments came as President George W. Bush and his advisers looked beyond the diplomatic showdown and made plans for a public relations buildup to potential war.  One option under serious consideration was Bush giving Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein a final ultimatum, perhaps with a short-term deadline, in a major address next week, two senior White House officials said.  The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, stressed that a variety of options are on the table and they all depend on the outcome of a U.N. Security Council debate on the U.S.-backed war resolution.  The United States still doesn't have the nine votes needed to win approval of the resolution, according to supporters and opponents, and many undecided council members are looking for a compromise.  Even if he gets the required votes, Bush needs to avoid a veto by Russia, France or China who all favor continuing inspections at least into July.  Once the vote is resolved one way or another, Bush will intensify his case for war, officials said, barring unforeseen events such as Saddam suddenly disarming or going into exile.  In addition to a possible address, they have discussed a presidential news conference and a Cabinet meeting as ways for Bush to communicate his plans to the nation next week.  As those discussions were taking place behind the scenes, Fleischer told reporters that Turkey would lose a proposed $15 billion aid package unless it admits troops into the country for the Iraq conflict.  ``The particular package that we've been talking to them about was predicated on assistance and cooperation in any plan for the use of force against Iraq,'' Fleischer said.  Until Tuesday, the spokesman had suggested part of the package would be available to Turkey regardless of whether 62,000 American troops are allowed in the country. White House officials said they were turning up pressure on Turkey in hopes that the parliament would grant the U.S. request on a second vote.  Even so, officials said future aid for Turkey would not be ruled out, just the massive package under consideration now.  At the United Nations, Secretary-General Kofi Annan called Baghdad's missile destruction ``a positive development,'' putting him at odds with Bush's assessment. Russia's Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, hardening Moscow's opposition to quick military action, indicated Russia may use its veto against the U.S.-backed resolution.  Both developments further complicated Bush's efforts to win passage of the resolution, adding significance to talk of what the administration would do if U.N. opposition cements against the U.S. position.  ``The president has made clear, that ... whether the United Nations votes or does not vote, that we will disarm Saddam Hussein with a coalition of the willing,'' Fleischer said. ``We are proceeding with all the plans for the vote.''  ``Now, if you are asking me if all of a sudden support around the world crumbles and there is absolutely no one for it, I can't predict with metaphysical certitude every eventuality,'' Fleischer said.  U.S. Ambassador John Negroponte was asked whether the United States would withdraw the resolution if it didn't have the votes to pass it.  ``We haven't crossed that bridge,'' he said. ``We believe that support should be there. We are not facing that kind of situation but we will cross the bridge when we come to it.''  Afterward, he and other White House officials said the remarks did not signal a lack of confidence in the resolution's prospects.    .

   Milosevic's wife to face trial   BELGRADE, Serbia-Montenegro (AP)  Slobodan Milosevic's wife will go on trial next week on charges of mismanaging state property during the former president's rule, a court said Thursday.  Mirjana Markovic, the power behind the scenes during Milosevic's 13-year reign, is accused of illegally providing their grandson's nanny with a state-owned luxury apartment in Belgrade in 2000.  The Belgrade district court said that Markovic will be tried along with 10 other Milosevic-era officials who face similar charges of ``inappropriate use of state property'' that carry a sentence of up to five years in jail.  The trial will start on March 13, the court said.  Milosevic and his wife wielded enormous power in Yugoslavia for more than a decade before he was swept out of power after a popular revolt in October 2000. The post-Milosevic government later extradited him to the U.N. war crimes tribunal in The Hague, the Netherlands.  Since then, many of Milosevic's political and business allies as well as his two children have been accused of crimes.  Markovic, the leader of the neo-communist Yugoslav Left party, lost her parliamentary immunity from prosecution after she failed to become a deputy in the parliament of Serbia and Montenegro, the country that last month succeeded Yugoslavia.    .

   Emboldened by U.N. report, Iraq calls for end to sanctions   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP)  Emboldened by the latest weapons inspectors' report, Iraq on Saturday called on the United Nations to remove crippling sanctions and to ban weapons of mass destruction in the entire Middle East  _  and eventually in the United States.  Iraq resumed destroying banned Al Samoud 2 missiles under U.N. supervision Saturday after taking a day off, crushing six more in a process that chief inspector Hans Blix called a ``substantial measure of disarmament.''  In the past week, Iraq has destroyed 40 of its 100 Al Samoud 2 missiles, prohibited by the United Nations because some tests indicated they could fly farther than 150 kilometers (93 miles). It also has been destroying equipment used to make them.  Reports to the Security Council on Friday by Blix and chief nuclear inspector Mohammed ElBaradei praised Iraq's recent compliance. But inspectors also questioned Iraq's motivation, as it began to give the inspectors what they wanted only when the threat of war became immediate.  U.S. President George W. Bush said the reports indicated that only a war will make Iraq disarm.  ``Unfortunately, it is clear that Saddam Hussein is still violating the demands of the United Nations by refusing to disarm,'' he told Americans in a radio address Saturday.  Iraq, however, took the report as an endorsement of its work and argued not only that war plans should be canceled, but that sanctions imposed on it by the Security Council for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait should be removed.  ``We demand that the Security Council and the world decide on ... the lifting of sanctions on Iraq in a comprehensive and complete way,'' said a spokesman for a meeting Saturday of Saddam and top-level officials, quoted by official Iraqi news media.  The unidentified spokesman claimed the weapons inspectors had verified Iraq has rid itself of weapons of mass destruction  _ something the inspectors said would take months to do  _  and appealed for a ban on such weapons to be extended beyond Iraq: to Israel, and eventually to the United States.  The spokesman, reporting on the meeting, said Iraq called on the Security Council ``to rid the Middle East of weapons of mass destruction since Iraq has become free of them.''  ``At the front of those that must be rid of these weapons is the Zionist entity,'' he said in a reference to Israel, adding that the order should ``move on after this region to America.''  The newspaper Babil, a popular daily owned by Saddam's son Odai, also said Saturday that the reports of Blix and ElBaradei were enough to suspend the sanctions, which are to be removed when the United Nations verifies that Iraq has no weapons of mass destruction or the means to make them.  In a front-page editorial, Babil said the reports should push Security Council members ``to think seriously about issuing a resolution lifting the sanctions imposed on Iraq, since it was proven that we don't possess weapons of mass destruction.''  Saddam has long claimed Iraq destroyed all its weapons of mass destruction. The United States and Britain claim he's lying, and have assembled a quarter-million troops around Iraq for a possible invasion.  Despite Iraq's demands of the Security Council, diplomats were working hard on very different proposals: a U.S.-led plan for disarmament or war by March 17, and a rival French plan for an emergency summit of Security Council members to come up with a compromise.  Bush and top advisers planned to lobby allies by telephone through the weekend and up until next week's planned vote on the ultimatum. French President Jacques Chirac talked to heads of state in an effort to drum up support for his plan, his office said.  Inspectors' spokesman Hiro Ueki said Iraqi workers crushed six Al Samoud 2 missiles Saturday at the al-Taji military complex north of Baghdad, under the supervision of weapons inspectors. Three of the missiles had warheads and three didn't, apparently because they hadn't been deployed.  Inspectors also supervised the destruction of tools and ``special equipment used to produce the Al Samoud 2 engine'' at the Al Samoud factory, he said, and another group of inspectors verified the emptying of Al Samoud 2 warheads at the Qa Qa complex just south of Baghdad.  Odai al-Taie, a senior Information Ministry official, said the workers crushing the missiles took Friday off because they had worked on Tuesday, the Muslim new year. Ueki described Friday as a ``planning day'' for teams working on missile destruction.  Ueki said an Iraqi chemical scientist granted an interview to weapons inspectors, bringing to eight the number of scientists who have given interviews since Feb. 28, when Iraq began urging them to talk. Since the same date, four scientists have refused.  Interviews with nuclear scientists have been conducted more frequently because the nuclear inspectors don't mind the scientists tape recording the interviews, a sticking point for the chemical and biological teams.  Inspectors also returned to a former helicopter airfield where Iraq buried bombs it says were armed with biological weapons in 1991. Ueki said inspectors there took samples from the remainders of stainless steel containers Iraq says it used to transport biological agents.    .

   Report: Hong Kong Jockey Club in talks to acquire its Macau rival   HONG KONG (AP)  The Hong Kong Jockey Club is in talks about buying out the horse racing club in neighboring Macau, a newspaper reported Tuesday.  The South China Morning Post quoted Hong Kong Jockey Club Chief Executive Lawrence Wong as saying the discussions were underway, but no price was reported.  The Hong Kong club is a charitable entity, while the Macau Jockey Club is a for-profit concern controlled by gambling tycoon Stanley Ho.  Hong Kong angered Macau's gaming industry last year when it banned gamblers in Hong Kong from placing horse bets with anyone but the Hong Kong Jockey Club. Macau had been taking off-track bets from people in Hong Kong, but the offices handling those wagers were closed.  The Macau club later threatened to start taking wagers on Hong Kong races in Macau, at a better price for gamblers because less tax would be levied, but the plan never materialized.  Neither club immediately returned phone calls from The Associated Press to inquire about the buyout talks.  Macau is a gambling enclave 60 kilometers (40 miles) west of Hong Kong that was governed by the Portuguese for more than four centuries before it returned to Chinese sovereignty in 1999. Hong Kong, a former British colony, returned to Chinese rule in 1997.    .

   Turkish party leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan named prime minister, may push to allow in U.S. troops   ANKARA, Turkey (AP)  The charismatic leader of Turkey's governing party was named prime minister Tuesday, a step that probably boosts chances that the United States will get permission to deploy troops in the country along Iraq's northern border.  Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who favors the deployment, hinted that he will reshuffle the Cabinet, but gave no indication if he would purge officials who opposed letting in the troops as analysts have suggested he might do.  Erdogan is extremely popular in Turkey and is likely be one of the few leaders with enough clout to unite his party and gain public support for allowing in the U.S. troops. Turks overwhelmingly oppose a war  _  by 94 percent, according to some polls.  Earlier this month, the Turkish parliament shocked the United States by rejecting the deployment by just four votes. Erdogan has hinted that he will resubmit the resolution for approval, which could take another week.  The United States is pressing Turkey to act quickly. Ships carrying equipment for U.S. troops are already waiting off the Turkish coast  In Washington, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Richard Myers told a Pentagon news conference Tuesday that the United States would ``have a northern option whether or not Turkey fully supports all our requests.  ``I'm not going to talk about the operational ways of doing it, but just be assured there will be a northern option,'' he said.  Also in Washington, Turkish Ambassador Farouk Logoglu told The Associated Press that the U.S. and Turkish militaries were holding informal discussions on the use of Turkish airspace.  The troop-basing resolution would allow the United States to use Turkish airspace. If the resolution is not passed, Washington would likely want to use the airspace for strikes against Iraq and for airlifting troops to northern Iraq.  Refusing access to the troop deployment would mean Turkey would lose a US$15 billion U.S. aid package that Washington has offered to help cushion the country's economy if there is war.  It would also threaten Turkey's possible role in the future of Iraq. Turkey, which fears northern Iraqi Kurds may declare independence in the aftermath of a war, has been pressing for a say if Saddam Hussein is ousted. Secession by Iraqi Kurds could inspire Turkey's rebel Kurds, who for 15 years have been fighting for autonomy.  After he was elected, Erdogan said Turkey wanted assurances from the United States on its role in Iraq.  Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said Tuesday there had been talks that Turkish troops could be deployed ``a short distance from their border to try to avoid refugee infiltration.''  Iraqi Kurds fear that Turkish troops could move deep into the autonomous enclave in northern Iraq and have threatened clashes.  Rumsfeld also said that like Turkey, the United States doesn't want to see a breakaway state: ``Our interest, needless to say, is to see that Iraq remains a single country,'' he said at the Pentagon news conference.  Prime Minister Abdullah Gul resigned earlier Tuesday to make way for Erdogan, who won a parliamentary seat in by-elections Sunday. Gul will remain as a caretaker prime minister until President Ahmet Necdet Sezer approves Erdogan's Cabinet, a move that could happen as early as Wednesday.  Erdogan said he would submit his Cabinet list to the president ``as soon as possible,'' and leaders of Erdogan's Justice and Development Party met Tuesday evening.  When asked about possible changes in the Cabinet, Erdogan said: ``Perhaps there will be a small amount of change, a certain number of revisions.''  Gul's resignation had been long expected. Erdogan heads the party but was constitutionally barred from running in November elections because he was jailed in 1999 for anti-secular activities. The Justice party changed the constitution after taking power in the elections.  Erdogan, a leader of Turkey's pro-Islamic movement when he was jailed, said he moderated his policies in prison. His party considers itself conservative and no longer uses the word 'Islamic' in its literature.  He now also advocates letting in U.S. troops for a war against Iraq even though it is a fellow Muslim state.  Unlike the soft-spoken Gul, Erdogan has a reputation as a fighter.  ``Erdogan will be willing to engage in a bruising confrontation in a way that Gul was not willing to,'' said Bulent Aliriza, an analyst at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies. ``If Erdogan decides that for his own reasons, and not U.S. pressure, he wants this, he will push it through.''  Tensions over the basing agreement spilled over into parliament Tuesday when opposition deputy Ufuk Ozkan shouted ``You are all American lackeys!'' at members of Erdogan's party, the Anatolia news agency reported.  A furious Justice party member, Fehmi Husrev Kutlu, rushed toward Ozkan, bumping into him and sending his eyeglasses flying, Anatolia reported. Other legislators surrounded the two to head off a brawl.    .

   EU rift over Iraq remains as France, Germany denounce U.S. move to war   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP)  Europe's divide over Iraq loomed ever larger Tuesday with France and Germany denouncing the U.S. move toward war while British Prime Minister Tony Blair said ousting Saddam Hussein now was key to solving similar crises in the future.  As European Union leaders restated their opposing views on Iraq, their foreign ministers debated the impending U.S.-led war against Iraq with EU president Greece keeping up appearances with a pledge to pursue a last ditch effort to avoid war.  Joschka Fischer and Dominique de Villepin, the German and French foreign ministers, were to attend a special United Nations Security Council meeting in New York Wednesday, called to issue a last-minute appeal for a peaceful solution to the Iraq crisis.  ''For us the United Natgions is the key authority'' in resolving the Iraq crisis, Fischer told reporters opn arrival at the EU meeting.  ''War is not justified,'' Fishcer told reporters. ''As members of the United Nations Security Council we want to restate that we want a peacefiul solution.''  De Villepin made no comment on arrival. Ahead of the EU meeting, Greek Foreign Minister Georhge Papandreou told reporters, ''We have to, and we will continue, to search for a peaceful solution to the crisis.''  The EU meeting could not hide the fact the Iraq crisis has made a mockery of EU aspirations to craft a common foreign policy.  Britain, Spain, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands and Portugal back the United States while France and Germany lead a group of nations opposing military action.  ``I would like to see that the European Union countries will come through this difficult moment with a determination to work for peace and look to the future,'' EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana said.  British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw remained in London for a debate in which the Blair government sought parliamentary approval for its decision to use ``all means necessary'' to disarm Saddam.  Blair was confident of retaining the support of a majority of parliament as he can count on votes from opposition Conservatives. He told the House of Commons the Iraq crisis was testing the fundamentals of international relations.  ``It will determine the way Britain and the world confront the central security threat of the 21st century; the development of the United Nations; the relationship between Europe and the United States; the relations within the European Union; and the way that the United States engages with the rest of the world,'' said Blair.  ``It will determine the pattern of international politics for the next generation,'' he said.  The EU foreign ministers met hours after U.S. President George W. Bush gave Saddam 48 hours to leave Iraq or face invasion.  French President Jacques Chirac said war without U.N blessing would undermine future disarmament efforts. ``Inspections (in Iraq) showed that they are a credible alternativ,'' Chirac said. ``To act without the legitimacy of the United Nations ... to favor the use of force over law, is taking a serious responsibility.''  In Berlin, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said there was no justification for war. ``Does the threat posed by the Iraqi dictator justify a war, which is sure to kill thousands of innocent children, women and men? My answer in this case was and is: No!'' Schroeder said.  Solana said the EU would help in the humanitarian crisis expected to follow an attack on Iraq. The EU is set to release 20 million euros (US$21.5 million) in immediate humanitarian aid for Iraq if war breaks out and may dip into an ``emergency reserve'' of 250 million euros (US$269 million) for humanitarian relief.  Elsewhere in Europe:	 _  Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt, overruling his defense minister, said his government would allow the United States use of its territory for military transports. In recent weeks, the U.S. military has been transporting military equipment from bases in Germany to the Gulf through the port of Antwerp. Defense Minister Andre Flahaut said on the weekend Belgium would no longer allow such transits  _  or use of Belgian airspace.     _  Greece began evacuating its embassy in Baghdad, saying all its personnel would be out of Iraq within a couple of days.     _  The Dutch government, facing strong public anti-war pressure, said it would not commit fighting forces to the war against Iraq but added it supported the military campaign to disarm Saddam.     _  In neutral Switzerland, Foreign Minister Micheline Calmy-Rey said the United States' decision to proceed with military action weakened the United Nations. ``It will be up to U.N. member states to restore its credibility,'' she said.

   U.S. and British troops move on Basra following assault on Baghdad   SOUTHERN IRAQ (AP)  U.S. and British troops were moving on the strategic southern port city of Basra Saturday after a massive aerial assault pounded Baghdad at dawn. Thousands of beleaguered Iraqi soldiers in the south surrendered in the face of the major push.  The battle for Basra, an oil hub of some 1.3 million people, was underway by midday, with coalition troops trying to surround Iraqi positions and force a surrender. U.S. aircraft bombed Iraqi tanks holding bridges close to the city. Iraqi forces responded with artillery fire.  Earlier Saturday, Baghdad was again targeted, one day after a massive U.S. aerial bombardment in which more than 300 Tomahawk cruise missiles rained down on the capital. The nine-story Security Headquarters in the Iraqi capital took a direct hit, strewing bricks, masonry and glass across the street in the al-Salhiya neighborhood of central Baghdad.  As coalition troops advanced, an entire Iraqi army division gave itself up, U.S. military officials said.  The division  _  the 51st Infantry Division, with 8,000 men and as many as 200 tanks, a key unit in the defense of Basra  _  was the largest defection in a day when Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's forces showed signs of crumbling.  Allied successes were marred by the collision of two Royal Navy helicopters over the Persian Gulf in which all six British crew members and one American were killed.  Saturday morning, American Marines and British troops rumbled along the main road from the Kuwaiti border to Basra, Highway 80, nicknamed the ``Highway of Death'' during the 1991 Gulf War, when U.S. airstrikes wiped out an Iraqi military convoy along it.  American units advancing west of Basra have already secured the Rumeila oil field, whose daily output of 1.3 million barrels makes it Iraq's most productive.  Until Basra, U.S. and British troops had encountered little resistance, even when they seized nearby Umm Qasr, and moved to secure key oil fields. Iraqis mostly fought back with small arms, pistols, machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades.  Regular Iraqi forces had withdrawn from Basra but elements of Saddam's security forces are continuing to resist, British Defense Secretary Geoff Hoon said Saturday.  Other units moved into airfield complexes in western Iraq believed to have Scud missiles capable of reaching Israel, and possibly weapons of mass destruction.  Early Saturday, more units were waiting in Kuwait to smash through any Iraqi resistance. Hundreds of tanks, armored personnel carriers, Humvees and trucks were lined up in parallel columns waiting in single-file to cross the Iraqi-Kuwait border.  By early next week, U.S. ground forces led by the Army's 3rd Infantry Division are likely to be at the outskirts of Baghdad, where they could face greater danger from the Republican Guard, some commanders said.  After weeks of delay, Turkey relented and agreed to let combat aircraft fly over its territory. At the same time, however, Turkey sent 1,000 troops into northern Iraq, and the government said it would send more to prevent Iraqi Kurds from creating an independent state. The United States strongly opposes any unilateral move by Turkey into northern Iraq.  A Turkish military spokesman on Saturday denied Turkish troops had crossed into Iraq.  The United States and Britain suffered their first casualties Thursday and Friday as they pushed into Iraq, with two U.S. Marines killed in combat and another eight British and four American Marines dying in a helicopter crash that appeared to be accidental. There was no clear figure of Iraqi casualties.  Australian commandos, who have been operating deep in Iraq, destroyed a command and control post and killed a number of soldiers, according to the country's defense chief, Gen. Peter Cosgrove.  In an address Saturday, Information Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf told Iraqis that fighting had been ``fierce.'' He said most of those captured by allied forces were civilians, not soldiers. He claimed Iraqi troops had destroyed five tanks.	 He said more than 200 Iraqis had been injured, including women, children and other civilians who were being treated at five hospitals in Baghdad.  Hoon said Saddam's regime was crumbling under the pressure of a huge air assault. ``As last night's dramatic television coverage showed, the lights stayed on in Baghdad, but the instruments of tyranny are collapsing,'' he said.  Iraqi Vice President Taha Yasin Ramadan, speaking on Iraqi Radio, was quoted by the British Broadcasting Corp.'s monitoring service as accusing Britain and the United States of working to ``eliminate'' the state of Iraq.  In a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Ramadan said, ``It is also regrettable and deplorable that the (U.N.) General Secretariat has not issued any statement or reaction that condemns or deplores this aggression.''  Despite the heavy bombing, which the U.S. Central Command said targeted military command and control installations, the Iraqi regime gave no sign of quitting. Bombers have also hit targets in the northern cities of Mosul, Kirkuk and Tikrit, Saddam's hometown.  The Iraqi government released a video of Saddam, in uniform, meeting with his son Qusai, the commander of the Republican Guard, and the defense minister, Gen. Sultan Hashim Ahmad. It was unclear when the video was made.  U.S. intelligence officials said the Iraqi command and control system was in disarray, and U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said, ``The regime is starting to lose control of their country.''    .

   Canadian premier fined for drunken driving on Hawaiian vacation   LAHAINA, Hawaii (AP)  The premier of the western Canadian province of British Columbia pleaded no contest to driving drunk during a Hawaiian vacation in January.  Gordon Campbell was ordered to pay fines and fees totaling $913, complete a 14-hour alcohol assessment program and have a substance abuse assessment. Under a no contest plea, the defendant neither admits nor denies the charge but agrees not to contest it.  ``Mr. Campbell is sufficiently embarrassed and ashamed for what he did, as well he should be,'' District Judge Reinette Cooper said Monday.  Campbell was not in court. Lawyer Steven Barta said his client had already completed the required programs in Canada. He also brought a check from Campbell to pay the fines and fees.  In the provincial capital of Victoria, Campbell said he was treated fairly and no longer drinks alcohol.  Campbell, 55, was pulled over Jan. 10 after police observed him driving erratically in a rented sport-utility vehicle. Campbell's blood-alcohol reading was 0.161 percent, more than twice the legal limit, in a roadside sobriety test.  In a tearful news conference after returning to Vancouver two days later, Campbell apologized to British Columbians, but refused to resign as premier. He said he drank three martinis and some wine before getting behind the wheel.    .

   Jack Welch seeks details on estranged wife's work in divorce case   BRIDGEPORT, Connecticut (AP)  Retired General Electric Co. Chairman Jack Welch is seeking work-related documents of his estranged wife in his high-stakes divorce case.  The Welches disclosed their plans to divorce a year ago, shortly after Suzy Wetlaufer  _  then editor of the Harvard Business Review  _ revealed she had become romantically involved with Welch while working on a story about him.  In court papers filed this week in state Supreme Court in New York, Welch requested a deposition next month of David Heleniak, a senior partner in the law firm of Shearman & Sterling in New York. He also wants to subpoena all documents maintained in Jane Beasley Welch's personnel file by Shearman & Sterling, a prestigious corporate law firm where she worked before she married Welch.  Welch specifically is seeking performance evaluations, correspondence between his estranged wife and partners while she worked at the law firm's office in London, and documents related to her prospects of becoming a partner.  Welch also wants details on Jane Beasley Welch's salary, benefits, retirement plan and other compensation paid to her.  Michael York, one of Jack Welch's attorneys, called the move routine.  A judge ruled in February that depositions in the divorce case will remain confidential.  Earlier documents in the case have included embarrassing details about perks Welch received as part of his retirement package from GE at a time when corporate scandals were sparking outrage.  The court order was requested by Jack Welch's attorney, Daniel K. Webb, who said Welch would likely be asked about his business dealings, his health and entries in his personal diary.  Webb also said details of the breakdowns of the Welches' previous marriages were likely to come up, and cited reports of alleged extramarital affairs by both.  Welch has previously failed in an attempt to temporarily seal a financial affidavit. That document detailed monthly outlays of some $51,000 for upkeep on a half-dozen houses scattered from Massachusetts to Florida, more than $52,000 for gifts and nearly $9,000 for food and drink, among other expenses.    .

   First relief convoy arrives in Iraq as allies struggle to clear the way   UMM QASR, Iraq (AP)  The first sizable relief convoy arrived in Iraq during a sandstorm Wednesday as allied forces struggled to clear the way for more aid shipments, using dolphins to remove mines from waterways and hunting Iraqi fighters around the port of Umm Qasr.  Three days after U.S. President George W. Bush promised ``massive amounts'' of humanitarian aid, seven large, battered tractor-trailers arrived in Umm Qasr carrying food and water donated by Kuwaitis. The convoy was escorted by U.S. soldiers.  ``We planned for 30 trucks but we only got seven loaded because of the severe sandstorm,'' said E.J. Russell of the Humanitarian Operations Center, a joint U.S.-Kuwaiti agency. The storm cut visibility to about 100 yards (91 meters).  Hundreds of cases of water were stacked on three of the trucks. The rest carried boxes of tuna, crackers, sweets and other food.  As the trucks lumbered past blasted buildings on the Iraq-Kuwait border, an Iraqi boy of about 10 pointed to his mouth and shouted ``Eat, eat!''  People lined up along the streets, giving thumbs-up signs to the aid convoy as it rolled by and begging for food and cigarettes.  After days of fierce fighting that shut down the city of Umm Qasr, Iraqi youths cheered and swarmed British troops as they handed out yellow meal packets and bottles of water Wednesday. The troops, already in the city, were not part of the aid convoy.  ``Umm Qasr is now secure  _  as a port and as a town,'' said Brig. Jim Dutton of the Royal Marines.  The town's deepwater port, the only one in Iraq, is essential for any relief effort.  Plans to bring supplies to Iraqi civilians had been on hold for days because of fighting across southern Iraq. On Tuesday, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan warned U.S. national security adviser Condoleezza Rice that the United States is legally responsible for providing relief aid.  White House spokesman Ari Fleischer blamed Saddam Hussein's regime for slowing the flow of US$105 million in U.S. aid by placing mines in the port of Umm Qasr.  U.S. Navy helicopters flew two dolphins  _  Makai and Tacoma  _ into Umm Qasr, where they were to begin ferreting out mines Wednesday.  Royal Marine commandos carried out an overnight sweep around the port, searching for Iraqi holdouts. The British said they had enough control over the area to begin sending in ships.  A British ship, the Sir Galahad, moved into position at the mouth of the Khor Abdallah river Tuesday night with 211 tons of food and 101 tons of bottled water. It was to begin the six-hour journey into Umm Qasr on Wednesday, according to a pool report.  Iraqis have about five weeks of food left, according to estimates by the World Food Program. About 13 million people  _  60 percent of Iraq's 22 million  _  are completely dependent on food handouts,  The World Food Program, a U.N. agency, said it would make its biggest single request for cash in its history	_  more than US$1 billion to help feed the war-stricken nation for about six months.  ``This could well turn into the largest humanitarian operation in history,'' said agency spokesman Trevor Rowe.  Before the war, Iraqis depended on government rations distributed under the U.N.'s oil-for-food program. The 7-year-old program allows Iraq to sell unlimited quantities of oil to buy food, medicine and other humanitarian goods. The proceeds from oil sales are deposited in a U.N.-controlled escrow account.  The war has thrown the future of that program in doubt.  Because the United States and Britain failed to get U.N. backing for the war, Russia, France, Germany and China want to ensure that the immediate humanitarian costs of the war are paid by the United States  _  and not the United Nations.  Annan wants to revive the U.N. aid program as quickly as possible. A resolution giving him authority to run the program for 45 days is stalled because Russia, Syria and others are insisting the United Nations must not sanction the war or give the United States control over the U.N.-controlled account, which holds billions of dollars.  Iraqi Trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi Saleh accused the United States and Britain of causing the hardships by launching the war and disrupting shipments of supplies under the oil-for-food program.  He claimed, though, that Iraq can fend for itself: ``Iraq does not need any humanitarian assistance. We are a rich country.''    .

   Report: Toefting drops appeal of assault conviction, will do jail   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP)  Former Danish international Stig Toefting dropped his appeal of an assault conviction and will serve a four-month jail sentence, Denmark's TV2 reported Monday.  Toefting was convicted in October 2002 of assaulting a pair of restaurant workers during a night out with national squad teammates in the capital, Copenhagen. He was sentenced to four months in prison, but appealed. The hearing was scheduled for April 10.  TV2, quoting Toefting's lawyer Anders Nemeth, reported that that 33-year-old midfielder was ready to serve his sentence immediately.  Neither Toefting or Nemeth were immediately available for comment.  Earlier this month, Toefting said English Premier League club Bolton let him go so he could prepare for the appeal.  It was unclear whether Toefting would return to Bolton after serving his sentence. The club said it wasn't aware of Toefting's decision to drop his appeal.  Toefting transferred to Bolton in February 2002 from German club Hamburg.  Toefting has been convicted before. In 1999 he was given a 20-day suspended sentence for assaulting a fan who berated him for playing with German club Duisburg.  The popular player  _  known for his temperament and the words ``No Regret'' tattooed across his chest  _  retired from Denmark's national team after it was knocked out in the second round of the 2002 World Cup.  Toefting joined the Danish squad in 1993 and has 41 caps.    .

   Russia accepts World Bank loan to combat AIDS, tuberculosis   MOSCOW (AP)  Russia has accepted a US$150 million World Bank loan to combat the spread of AIDS and tuberculosis, ending a negotiating process that lasted four years, World Bank officials said Friday.  The World Bank first offered the loan in 1999, but disagreements over treatment kept the project on hold. Russia objected to World Bank rules that required monitoring of patients receiving medication, the World Bank said.  But after drawn-out talks, President Vladimir Putin signed off on the loan, which will take effect this year, the World Bank said.  ``Russia has one of the fastest growing AIDS epidemics in the world'' and has a ``fearsome'' problem with tuberculosis, particularly drug-resistant strains, said Olesoji Adeyi, a World Bank health specialist.  ``It's a potential dual epidemic,'' he said, adding that people with immune systems weakened by the AIDS virus are especially vulnerable to contracting TB, which he called an ``opportunistic disease.''  AIDS came relatively late to Russia, but spread rapidly, primarily due to intravenous drug abuse and a lack of prevention programs. Officials have registered more than 230,000 cases of HIV, though health experts say the actual number of HIV infections tops 1 million.  Tuberculosis, meanwhile, has also emerged as a serious problem, particularly in Russia's overcrowded prisons.    .

   North Korea says Security Council's handling of nuclear issue is 'a prelude to war'   SEOUL, South Korea (AP)  North Korea on Sunday rejected the U.N. Security Council's plan to discuss the standoff over its suspected nuclear weapons development, calling it ``a prelude to war.''  Meanwhile, South Korean officials said Cabinet-level talks scheduled this week between the two Koreas looked unlikely to take place. Seoul had hoped to use the meeting to try to persuade its communist neighbor to scrap its nuclear ambitions.  The Security Council is scheduled to discuss North Korea's nuclear program on Wednesday, and Pyongyang has said that any sanctions imposed on it will be tantamount to war.  The U.N. discussions are ``a grave provocation act intended to scuttle all (the North's) effort for dialogue and aggravate the situation on the Korean Peninsula,'' a North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman was quoted as saying by state-run news agency KCNA.  The Security Council's ``handling of the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula itself is precisely a prelude to war,'' the spokesman said.  For months, North Korea has insisted on direct talks with the United States to negotiate a nonaggression treaty.  Washington has refused, saying a multilateral solution to the crisis was needed. The U.S. administration has been pressing the Security Council to adopt a statement condemning Pyongyang for failing to meet its obligations to prevent the spread of nuclear arms.  But KCNA quoted the spokesman as saying that the U.S. invasion of Iraq showed that Washington was not bound by international agreements. A nonaggression treaty with Pyongyang would not necessarily avert war because it may not be honored, he said.  It was not immediately clear if Pyongyang would drop its demand for a nonaggression pact.  North Korea also said Washington is ``seriously mistaken'' if it thinks that the communist country will accept the U.S. demand to disarm. It said it will ignore any U.N. resolution on the nuclear issue.  If the U.N. Security Council cooperates with U.S. efforts to ``stifle'' North Korea, it would leave the North with ``no other option but to beef up the deterrent force for war by mobilizing all the potentials,'' KCNA quoted the Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying.  For weeks, North Korea has claimed that the United States plans to attack it after Iraq. Washington says it seeks a diplomatic end, but has not ruled out a military solution.  Last year, U.S. President George W. Bush said North Korea was part of an ``axis of evil'' along with Iraq and Iran, and that it was developing weapons of mass destruction.  South Korea has tried to keep a lid on rising tensions between Washington and Pyongyang.  But officials in Seoul said Sunday that North Korea had yet to confirm that Cabinet-level meetings scheduled to begin Monday in Pyongyang would go ahead. Seoul had hoped to use the three-day talks to try to persuade its communist neighbor to scrap its suspected nuclear program in return for aid and better relations with the outside world.  North Korea called off two working-level talks with South Korea last month.  Also on Sunday, South Korean lawmakers said they would work to quickly set up a special parliamentary committee to deal with the North's nuclear issue.  The nuclear standoff began in October, when U.S. officials said North Korea admitted having a secret nuclear program in violation of a 1994 agreement.    .

   Grandson of Toyota founder promoted to senior managing director   TOKYO (AP)  Toyota Motor Corp. said Tuesday it will promote Akio Toyoda, a grandson of the company's founder who is widely viewed as a candidate to some day head Japan's largest automaker.  Managing director Toyoda, 46, grandson of Kiichiro Toyoda and the eldest son of Toyota honorary chairman Shoichiro Toyoda, will become one of 14 senior managing directors under a streamlined management system set to be introduced after a shareholders' meeting in June, the company said in a statement.  Toyoda, who joined Toyota, based in Toyota city, central Japan, in 1984, spearheaded the automaker's Internet and telematics business  _  a technology that puts wireless communications into vehicles. Considered a candidate for future Toyota president, Toyoda oversees its China business, a critical market for the automaker.  Toyoda has been on the star track for years. When he joined the board in 2000, he was its youngest member.  Under a reform led by President Fujio Cho, the membership of Toyota's board of directors will be slashed to 27 from 58. Executive vice presidents will be reduced to seven from nine.  The new system is designed to ``speed up decision-making and operations,'' Toyota spokesman Shigeru Hayakawa said.  Toyota's top posts held by Cho and Chairman Hiroshi Okuda remain unchanged.  Kiichiro Toyoda founded the automaker in 1937, transforming the loom manufacturer started by his father into an automaker.    .

   Lawyer reprimanded for Chiluba's failure to appear in court   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP)  The lawyer of former Zambian president Frederick Chiluba was reprimanded by a Lusaka magistrate when his client failed to appear in court on theft charges Friday.  Chiluba, who is accused of stealing millions of dollars while in office, did not appear at the Lusaka magistrates court as scheduled because he has filed an appeal to have case heard at a higher court.  Chiluba's lawyer, Chifumu Banda, told the court he had advised Chiluba not to appear in court Friday, following an agreement with the prosecution that the case be postponed for a month while the appeal is considered.  ``The matter is before this court and whether an accused person wishes to request for an adjournment or they wish to be absent for any other reason, such a request must be done here,'' said Magistrate Christopher Shacifwa.  He said lawyers could not decide on postponements between themselves.  Shacifwa ordered Chiluba to appear in court on May 16.  Chiluba faces 65 counts of theft including that of 15 billion kwacha (US$3 million) in cash from the Zambia National Commercial Bank in Lusaka.  He has denied the allegations.  Chiluba was Zambia's first democratically elected president. He came to office in 1991 and served two five-year terms.      (str-sg-sv-dk)    .

   Spurned by U.S. over human rights, Indonesia turns to Russia for arms   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP)  The dictator Suharto has fallen, the constitution has changed, the media was unshackled, democratic elections held, and East Timor freed. After Sept. 11, 2001, Indonesia was quick to sign onto U.S. President George W. Bush's global war on terror.  Yet, Washington maintains a 12-year ban on arms sales to the world's most populous Muslim nation with the aim of curbing human rights abuses still happening despite momentous political change.  Frustrated, Jakarta's generals are looking elsewhere to replace antiquated arsenals.  Later this month Indonesian President Megawati Sukarnoputri travels to Moscow to seek the Kremlin's help in modernizing her increasingly obsolete 300,000-member armed forces.  She is also likely to open the way for Russian companies to vie for lucrative deals in the oil and gas sector, long dominated by American and British resource giants.  Although opposite ends of the Earth, Indonesia and Russia have some basic things in common.  Both are geographically sprawling with massive multiethnic populations. Both are struggling to preserve national unity as they fight separatism and build democracy after the collapse of decades of authoritarian rule.  Both are resource-rich, but face huge economic problems made worse by endemic corruption. And, currently, both have opposed the U.S.- led war on Iraq.  Indonesia's Foreign Ministry spokesman Marty Natalegawa says Megawati's meeting with Russian President Putin slated for April 21 will touch on the Iraq crisis.  But other diplomats say that issue will serve primarily to bring the two closer together on bottom-line issues such as trade and arms sales.  Analysts worry that Indonesia's military is now so degraded it can no longer control the borders of the far-flung archipelago, allowing for easy infiltration by extremists.  Last year's Bali bombings, which killed 202 people, illustrated the threat of terrorism in Indonesia. And, broad opposition to the U.S.-led attack on Iraq threatens to lead to a backlash by militant Islamists.  ``Nearly everybody in Indonesia sees this Iraq war as completely unnecessary and there is widespread public opposition to U.S. policies,'' said Jusuf Wanadi of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Jakarta.  Close ties between Moscow and Jakarta are not unprecedented.  Indonesia relied on Soviet military assistance in the 1950s under Megawati's father and founding President Sukarno, but these were severed after the anti-communist Gen. Suharto seized power in 1965.  The United States quickly became the Southeast Asian country's main weapons supplier, and annual arms sales peaked at US$400 million in the 1980s.  In 1991, however, the U.S. Congress banned this after Indonesian troops killed hundreds of civilians in East Timor.  In 1999, East Timor became free, but only after Indonesian forces laid waste to it as they withdrew after a pro-independence referendum.  The shocking level of destruction prompted U.S. lawmakers to expand the ban to cover almost all military ties with Indonesia.  Since then some in the Bush administration  _  particularly Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz, a former ambassador to Jakarta and a prime architect of the Iraq war  _  have pushed for the ban to be repealed.  So far, U.S. lawmakers have reinstated only a limited officer training program. But that's far from enough for Indonesia's generals.  ``I think the Indonesian military has finally decided that restrictions and conditionalities from Washington are just not worth it,'' said Juwono Sudarsono, a former defense minister. ``So they want to look for alternative sources for planes, helicopters and other hardware.''  Moscow has already had some success in wooing Indonesia as a customer.  Jakarta has recently purchased some Russian weapons, including 10,000 Kalashnikov assault rifles, a squadron of naval Mil-2 helicopters and a dozen BTR-80A amphibious carriers for its marines.  Currently, Indonesia uses short-range Rapier missiles purchased 30 years ago to protect its vital oil and natural gas fields in Sumatra, Borneo and Papua from air attack.  ``Replenishing them has been a big problem,'' Sudarsono said.  Air defense commanders want to augment the Rapiers with Russia's impressive long-range S-300 missiles, or shorter-range systems such as the SA-15 Gauntlet or shoulder-fired Igla.  The Air Force is reportedly considering purchasing several squadrons of Sukhoi Su-27 interceptors, considered the world's premier dogfighters.  Previously, Indonesian Air Force commanders preferred Western jets that were compatible with the U.S.-made F-16 fighter-bombers already in the Indonesian inventory. But neighboring Malaysia's success in integrating Russian MiG-29s and American F/A-18 Hornets persuaded them otherwise, Sudarsono said.  If Megawati does stiff-arm the United States on the weapons issue, it is unlikely relations with Washington will be permanently damaged. Whatever happens, Indonesia, a mainly Muslim but politically secular state, is natural ally in the struggle against terrorism and religious militancy.  What could be more worrying for Washington is Russia's economic ambitions.  Trade between Indonesia and Russia increased by dlrs 36.2 million to dlrs 203.5 million in 2001  _  the last year for which statistics are available. Analysts say this can only grow.  The real concerns, though, are in the petroleum sector.  Megawati and Putin are expected to sign agreements to give Russian companies a toehold in Indonesia's oil and gas industry, long dominated by American and British giants such as Exxon Mobil and BP.    .

   Czech nuclear plant gets permission to produce at full capacity   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP)  The troubled nuclear power plant in Temelin received permission from state authorities Monday to start power production at full capacity.  Pavel Pitterman, the spokesman for the State Office for Nuclear Safety, said his office gave the plant permission to run its second, newer 1,000-megawatt unit at full capacity. The plant's first 1,000-megawatt unit has already operated at full capacity during past tests.  The spokesman for the Temelin plant, Milan Nebesar, said that an 18-month trial production at full capacity at the second unit, needed to declare the unit ready for commercial production, would start Friday.  The plant, based on Russian design and upgraded with U.S. technology, has been plagued by frequent, non-nuclear malfunctions since testing began in November 2000.  Located just 60 kilometers (35 miles) north of the Austrian border, it has been a source of friction between the two countries.  Critics in non-nuclear Austria argue the plant is unsafe and demand that it be shut down, but Czech authorities insist the plant is safe.  The plant's first unit, currently shut down for planned maintenance scheduled to take two months, has already entered the last stage of tests and should be ready for commercial use at the end of 2003.    .

   Appeal launched against Russian journalist's treason conviction   MOSCOW (AP)  The lawyer for a Russian military journalist convicted of treason filed an appeal Wednesday in an effort to overturn the guilty verdict against his client, who was released on parole earlier this year, news agencies reported.  Grigory Pasko's lawyer Genri Reznik filed the appeal with Russian Supreme Court, the Interfax and ITAR-Tass news agencies reported. He asked the court to invalidate the verdict and throw out the criminal case against Pasko, they said.  Pasko was sentenced to four years in prison in December 2001 for illegally attending a meeting of top military commanders and taking notes there. A military court said he intended to pass the notes to Japanese media with which he had worked.  Pasko, whose sentence included time served, was released in January for good behavior after serving more than two-thirds of the sentence. He has maintained his innocence, saying the military was punishing him for exposing environmental abuses by the Russian navy, including the dumping of radioactive waste into the sea.  Reznik said an initial appeal he lodged the day Pasko was freed never reached the presidium of the Supreme Court, according to Interfax. The lawyer said the court's military board had refused to launch proceedings on the appeal.  Reznik said he addressed the new appeal directly to Supreme Court Chairman Vyacheslav Lebedev and asked that it not be considered by military judges ``because the military justice system has adopted a biased attitude against Pasko,'' Interfax reported.

   U.S. troops capture Saddam's half brother, stop major bank robbery in capital   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP)  American commandos captured a half brother of Saddam Hussein on Thursday, the latest success in a campaign to round up insiders from the former regime. U.S. troops thwarted a Baghdad bank robbery over the protests of Iraqis eager to share in the loot.  As U.S. forces struggled to restore order in Iraq, FBI Director Robert Mueller announced that agents had been detailed to help recover antiquities looted from museums in Baghdad and elsewhere. Agents will aid international efforts to recover stolen items ``on both the open and black markets,'' he said.  With the fighting all but over, the USS Constellation steamed from the Persian Gulf for its home port, carrying dozens of warplanes no longer needed. It was the second aircraft carrier ordered home in recent days.  The U.S. military's search for chemical and biological weapons is unlikely to succeed until Iraqis lead American forces to them, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said Thursday.  ``I don't think we'll discover anything, myself,'' Rumsfeld said at a meeting with Pentagon employees. ``I think what will happen is we'll discover people who will tell us where to go find it.''  U.S. troops have found suspicious chemicals and facilities at a number of sites but tests on the materials have proved negative or inconclusive. Eliminating such weapons was a chief reason President George W. Bush gave for the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq that began March 20.  Brig. Gen. Vincent Brooks announced the capture of Barzan Ibrahim Hasan al-Tikriti, telling reporters he was an adviser to Saddam ``with extensive knowledge of the regime's inner workings.''  A U.S. intelligence official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Barzan Ibrahim had been a presidential adviser to Saddam's regime since 1998, but had a shaky relationship with his half brother and was not part of the regime's inner circle.  He was a representative to the United Nations in Geneva from 1989 to 1998. Earlier, from 1979 to 1983, he headed Iraq's Mukhabarat, or intelligence service, a period when the organization arranged executions of regime opponents in Iraq and overseas, the official said.  Brooks provided scant details of the operation that netted Barzan Ibrahim, saying he was taken inside Baghdad and that U.S. special forces were aided by Marines. He said there were no casualties.  Another of Saddam's three half brothers, Watban Ibrahim Hasan al-Tikriti, was captured earlier by U.S. forces. The third has not been found.  American forces have been criticized for failing to stop looting in several Baghdad cities, and there have been complaints, as well, that humanitarian relief has been slow in arriving.  But Marines foiled a brazen act of lawlessness during the day when they interrupted a robbery-in-progress at a branch of the al-Rashid Bank and took away US$4 million for safekeeping.  Thieves had blown a hole in the vault and dropped children in to bring out fistfuls of cash. As word spread that the robbery was under way, Iraqis gathered, saying they had accounts at the branch, and a riot broke out.  Marines broke it up  _	over the protests of Iraqis not involved in the robbery  _	and the thieves were arrested.  ``These people want the money and they believe it is rightfully their money, but they don't understand that the proper distribution is not first-come, first-served,'' said Col. Philip DeCamp, a battalion commander.  Gen. Tommy Franks, the commander of Operation Iraqi Freedom, told reporters during a visit to Kuwait that ``the looting goes down every day and I think you will continue to see it go down because the Iraqis are now stepping up and controlling the problems for themselves.''  There was evidence of slow progress. Baghdad residents gathered outside the city's police academy when word spread that some of the cars looted in recent days had been recovered.  Still, more than a week after the regime collapsed, Marine Staff Sgt. Jose Guillen said power has been restored  _  by use of diesel plants  _  to only about 500 homes in Baghdad, a city of roughly 5 million. He said U.S. forces expect to get one of the city's power grids on line by Friday.  Unrest continued in other parts of the country. Americans sought to bring calm to Mosul, where U.S. troops killed 17 people in clashes earlier in the week.  Brooks, briefing reporters at the U.S. Central Command headquarters, also disclosed that Marines had broken up violent clashes on Wednesday in Tikrit, Saddam's hometown. The fighting broke out between club-wielding members of the former ruler's clan and a rival group, he said.  Clan rivalries aside, there are numerous other resentments shaping events in the post-Saddam era. Majority Shiite Muslims are eager for power after decades of Saddam favoring Sunni Muslims, for example. And Kurds are eager to claim what they say Saddam took from them and gave to Arabs in the northern part of the country.  International experts, appalled at the looting of Iraqi historical artifacts, met in Paris under U.N. auspices and called for a temporary embargo on Iraqi cultural objects.  Some of the participants at the meeting said it appeared the looting was organized, and some of those involved had keys to museum vaults and were able to remove items from safes.  One suggested the effort was organized from outside Iraq.  ``It looks as if part of the looting was a deliberate planned action,'' said McGuire Gibson, a University of Chicago professor and president of the American Association for Research in Baghdad.  ``I have a suspicion it was organized outside the country, in fact I'm pretty sure it was,'' Gibson said. He added that if a good police team was put together, ``I think it could be cracked in no time.''  The Baghdad museum housed irreplaceable Babylonian, Sumerian and Assyrian collections that chronicled ancient life in the cradle of civilization, the area around the Tigris and Euphrates rivers.    .

   Malaysian court rejects Anwar's appeal against sodomy conviction   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP)  Malaysia's second highest court on Friday rejected an appeal by jailed former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim against his conviction and nine-year prison sentence for sodomy.  A three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals unanimously upheld a verdict by High Court Judge Arifin Jaka nearly three years ago that found Anwar guilty of sodomizing his wife's former driver. Sodomy is a crime in this predominantly Muslim Southeast Asian country.  Anwar is expected to appeal again with the Federal Court, Malaysia's highest court.  Speaking to reporters after the verdict, Anwar lambasted the judges, saying they had been ``preselected'' by the government to quash his appeal.  ``These are spineless judges,'' Anwar said. ``This decision is all scripted.''  The judges also rejected an application by Anwar to be released on bail. But Anwar's lawyers said they were filing a fresh request for bail pending a further appeal.  On Monday, Anwar completed his sentence for a separate conviction on corruption charges, after the six-year sentence was reduced by one-third for good behavior. He then began serving the nine-year prison sentence for sodomy, his lawyers said.  Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad fired Anwar, his former protege, in 1998 following disputes over financial policy. Anwar led large protests against Mahathir before he was arrested, charged and convicted on corruption and sodomy charges.  Anwar claims the charges were fabricated to keep him from challenging Mahathir for power. The government denies this.  Human rights group Amnesty International said Friday's verdict ``represents another step in the further deterioration in the human rights situation in the country.''  ``This decision adds to the already widespread perception that in politically sensitive cases, the independence of the judiciary can no longer be guaranteed,'' the London-based group said in a statement. ``Today, the situation looks much bleaker.''  Param Cumaraswamy, the U.N. special investigator on the freedom of judges and lawyers, said in a statement: ``So long as there are judges who are prepared to and continue to compromise the value and principles of their high office ... there is no hope for judicial independence and impartiality in the Malaysian justice system.''  About 200 demonstrators outside the court shouted Anwar's slogan of ``Reformasi!'' for political change. Police armed with automatic weapons stood by to prevent rowdiness.  The court also dismissed a joint appeal by Anwar's adopted brother, Sukma Darmawan, who was convicted together with Anwar for sodomy in August 2000 and sentenced to six years in jail and whipping.  Sukma has been free on bail pending appeal, but the judges on Friday ordered him to begin his sentence.    .

   Shaquille O'Neal's wife gives birth to baby boy   EL SEGUNDO, California (AP)  Shaquille O'Neal's wife gave birth to a baby boy early Saturday, eliminating any chance that the Los Angeles Lakers center might skip a playoff game to witness the birth.  Shaunie O'Neal gave birth to the couple's third child at 1:52 a.m. at a Los Angeles-area hospital, team spokesman John Black said. He did not provide the baby's name or other details.  O'Neal was excused from Saturday's practice. He was scheduled to fly on his own to Minneapolis late Saturday for Sunday's opening game of a first-round playoff series against the Minnesota Timberwolves.  ``We're really happy for the delivery of a child and the fact that everything's safe and sound and we can go forward from there,'' coach Phil Jackson said. ``Hopefully he can get to Minneapolis, get some rest and be ready to play the first game. That's a pivotal game for every team.''  O'Neal had said he could not rule out missing a game to witness the birth. The due date was April 27, the same day as Game 4 of the best-of-seven series between the Timberwolves and the Lakers.  Teammate Kobe Bryant said he would not be surprised if O'Neal had a big game Sunday despite his expected late arrival in Minneapolis.  ``You just roll off the adrenaline,'' said Bryant, who scored 48 points in a 2001 playoff game at Sacramento after leaving the team to attend to a personal matter.  The birth comes days after the death of O'Neal's maternal grandfather, Sirlester O'Neal. Funeral services are expected to be held this week in South Carolina, Black said. O'Neal is expected to attend.    .

   France proposes suspending U.N. sanctions against Iraq, a step toward U.S. goal   UNITED NATIONS (AP)  France on Tuesday proposed immediately suspending U.N. sanctions targeting Iraq civilians, an important step toward the U.S. goal of ending trade embargoes that have crippled the country's economy.  The surprise move by France, which led opposition to the U.S. war against Iraq, followed last week's call by U.S. President George W. Bush for sanctions to be lifted quickly, so Iraq can trade freely and its oil revenue can be used to finance reconstruction.  France's U.N. ambassador, Jean-Marc de La Sabliere, made the proposal at a Security Council meeting where members heard a briefing by chief U.N. weapons inspector Hans Blix and for the first time exchanged views on potentially divisive postwar issues.  The proposal would end the U.N. ban on trade and investment in Iraq while leaving a 12-year-old arms embargo in place.  The Security Council imposed sanctions after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Under council resolutions, sanctions cannot be lifted until U.N. inspectors certify that Iraq's nuclear, chemical and biological weapons have been destroyed along with the long-range missiles to deliver them.  Along with France, Russia, Germany and China also strongly opposed the war. But de La Sabliere said before the meeting that Security Council ``must take into account the new realities on the ground.''  Russian Ambassador Sergey Lavrov had said his country is ``not at all opposed to the lifting of sanctions.'' But he said Russia wants U.N. inspectors to certify that Iraq has been disarmed of all weapons of mass destruction, as required under U.N. resolutions.  Asked about the French proposal, he said: ``We are ready to discuss it.''  At another closed-door council meeting later Tuesday, the council was to hear from Benon Sevan, head of the U.N. oil-for-food program, which had been providing food for 60 percent of Iraq's 24 million people.  France's de La Sabliere said he also proposed that the council phase out the oil-for-food program, which allowed Iraq to sell unlimited quantities of oil provided the money went for humanitarian goods and compensation to victims of the first Gulf War.  ``There should be some adjustment with a view of a phasing out of this program,'' de La Sabliere said.  This is one of the difficult decisions the council will face in the weeks ahead on divisive issues stemming from the war against Iraq.  These include not only Iraq's disarmament and the future of sanctions but the U.N. role in Iraq now that the fighting is over, control of Iraq's oil revenue, and lucrative reconstruction contracts.  Blix stressed that council resolutions call for U.N. inspectors to have access to all sites and people in Iraq. He said he told the council that he believes the world would like Iraq's disarmament confirmed by an international body that has been involved in the country for over 10 years.  The Bush administration, which accused Blix of hindering its drive for international support for the war, has already sent its own teams to Iraq to search for illegal weapons.  ``At the moment, the coalition has assumed the responsibilities for disarming Iraq,'' U.S. Ambassador John Negroponte, said Tuesday when asked whether U.S. teams would work with U.N. inspectors.  He said important scientists had turned themselves in, and the atmosphere had changed which should enable any Iraqi ``to speak more freely and speak without fear of retribution to those who are asking them the questions.''  France's de La Sabliere said he also proposed that the council ``find practical and pragmatic arrangements'' to coordinate and combine the work of the American teams and the work of U.N. inspectors ``so that the Iraqi disarmament could be internationally verified.''  He told The Associated Press he envisioned sanctions being suspended ``for a couple of months,'' and possibly renewed. He also envisioned U.S. and U.N. inspectors working together. ``And then sanctions could be lifted when a legitimate Iraqi government is in place,'' he said.  In an interview with BBC radio aired Tuesday, Blix said that before the war, the U.S. and Britain appeared to have used ``shaky'' intelligence, including forged documents, in an effort to prove Iraq had banned weapons.  Blix said it was ``very, very disturbing'' that U.S. intelligence failed to identify as fakes documents suggesting Iraq tried to buy uranium from the West African nation of Niger. He told reporters at the United Nations on Tuesday that the contract about ``yellow cake'' uranium ``was more than shaky, it was a fake.''  U.N. inspectors went back to Iraq for the first time in four years in late November and discovered no weapons of mass destruction during 3{ months of searching. Secretary-General Kofi Annan ordered all U.N. international staff, including the inspectors, to leave Iraq just before the war began on March 20. He has said he expects them to return.  Annan also said Tuesday in Austria that Iraqis should be in charge of their own future and natural resources. He acknowledged that ``the U.N. is being challenged'' but said he expected an agreement on the U.N. role in Iraq in the ``not too distant future.''    .

   U.S. won't choose subcontractors for rebuilding Iraq, U.S. official says   LISBON, Portugal (AP)  The U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Europe and Eurasia said Tuesday that the U.S. government won't be involved in choosing subcontractors for American companies named to help rebuild Iraq.  ``The way it works is that there have been an initial set of contracts let to US companies, since it's U.S. money. Those companies can subcontract to any company they want,'' Elizabeth Jones said.  She made the statements after a meeting with the speaker of the Portuguese parliament, Joao Mota Amaral.  ``The U.S. government has done what it is going to do: it has opened up the process to international companies. We can't direct commerce,'' Jones said. ``Once it's a commercial proposition, then international bidding processes come into effect.''  Jones met with Defense Minister Paulo Portas on Tuesday and will meet Foreign Minister Antonio Martins da Cruz before leaving Portugal Wednesday.  About 50 Portuguese companies - mostly in the construction sector  _  are applying for subcontracts to help rebuild Iraq, Portuguese media reported. Many are hoping to reap benefits from Portuguese government support of the U.S.-led war to oust Saddam Hussein.  Also, Portugal hosted a last ditch pre-war summit in the Azores islands for leaders of the United States, Britain and Spain.    .

   Singapore extends use of SARS thermal scanners to include checkpoints with Malaysia   SINGAPORE (AP)  Singapore authorities extended the use of its state-of-the-art thermal imaging scanner to fight the deadly SARS virus by placing units at its border with Malaysia.  The Immigration and Checkpoints Authority said it began a trial of the scanners Wednesday at its Woodlands and Tuas checkpoints to screen for people suffering from severe acute respiratory syndrome.  Nine scanners, developed locally for military purposes, were placed at Singapore's Changi Airport last week to check people arriving from SARS-affected countries.  Those who show up on the camera screen as ``hot bodies,'' or with a temperature greater than 37.5 degrees Celsius (99.5 degrees Fahrenheit), will be pulled aside.  Each day about 90,000 people cross the border between Malaysia and Singapore. Any person found to be entering Singapore with a high temperature would be directed to a nearby nurse station for further checks.  Singapore has reported 16 deaths, the world's third-highest toll, out of 186 infected from the flu-like illness. Globally, at least 236 people have died and more than 4,000 have become sickened with the illness.  Immigration and Checkpoints Authority spokeswoman Ngoon Pei Ling said during the trial period the scanners would be placed at bus checkpoints, where passengers are already required to disembark for immigration purposes.    .

   Rudolph Giuliani, Judith Nathan to marry May 24 at Gracie Mansion   NEW YORK (AP)  Rudolph Giuliani will wed his companion, Judith Nathan, on May 24 in the ex-mayor's old home, Gracie Mansion.  The news was announced Thursday by Giuliani spokeswoman Sunny Mindel. His successor, Mayor Michael Bloomberg, will perform the ceremony.  Giuliani, 58, proposed to Nathan, a former nurse, during a November business trip to Paris	_  five months after he finalized his divorce from Donna Hanover after 20 years of marriage.  In interviews last year, Giuliani said Nathan gave him ``tremendous emotional support'' through his treatment for prostate cancer and as he led the city during the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center.  ``We were close already,'' Giuliani said. ``And then we went through hell together.''  Giuliani and Nathan began appearing in public together in May 2000. Soon after, he announced that he and Hanover were moving toward legal separation.  During the legal proceedings leading up to the divorce, a judge ruled that Nathan could not visit Gracie Mansion, the official mayoral residence, as long as Giuliani's children lived there.  Giuliani and Hanover have two teenage children, Andrew and Caroline. The divorce settlement called for Giuliani to pay Hanover more than $6.8 million.  Hanover, 53, is host of a syndicated television show, ``Famous Homes and Hideaways.'' Last month, she and her fiance  _  an old high school sweetheart  _  invited the press along as they went shopping for wedding bands, saying they are planning a wedding in the New York City area this summer.  Giuliani's first marriage to his second cousin, Regina Peruggi, lasted about 14 years. It was annulled by the Catholic Church because the couple had not obtained a church dispensation required when second cousins marry.  Nathan divorced wallpaper salesman Bruce Nathan in 1992. They have a teenage daughter.  The Giuliani-Nathan nuptials will be a first for Bloomberg, who is making an exception from his policy of not performing weddings, said Bloomberg spokesman Ed Skyler. Giuliani regularly officiated at weddings while in office.  ``The mayor is honored by their request,'' Skyler said.    .

   U.S., Britain drafting resolution limiting U.N. role in Iraq to humanitarian relief   LONDON (AP)  The United States and Britain are preparing a resolution that would give the United Nations a role in humanitarian relief but not peacekeeping in Iraq, a senior official in U.S. President George W. Bush's administration said Friday.  Separately, the United States has decided to divide the military and humanitarian relief mission in Iraq into three parts under American, British and Polish command, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Six European countries have agreed to contribute troops to the British and Polish sectors to create an international stability force, the official said.  The draft resolution would limit the U.N. role to helping with refugees and displaced people, reconstruction and humanitarian assistance, the official said. The United States and Britain agree on all but a few of the fine details of the resolution, the official said, though there is no timetable on when it would be introduced.  U.N. officials are already in Iraq providing humanitarian relief. U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan said this week that the body has no interest in policing a postwar Iraq, although it could contribute to the political resuscitation of the country.  ``Take the question of security. I don't think the U.N. would want to take on that,'' Annan said. ``There has been a suggestion that the U.N. wanted to take over the whole Iraq and run it, which was also not the case.'' What the United Nations could contribute beyond humanitarian assistance was ``political facilitation,'' Annan said.  The proposed draft resolution would probably face resistance from other U.N. Security Council members who have favored a U.N.-convened conference of the kind that helped establish Afghanistan's post-Taliban government.  U.S. Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld discussed the resolution with Prime Minister Tony Blair and Defense Secretary Geoff Hoon on Friday as Rumsfeld returned from a tour of Iraq, Afghanistan and the Persian Gulf region. Rumsfeld said afterward he hoped the U.N. would play a role but did not publicly discuss the draft resolution outlining that role.  Hoon, who joined Rumsfeld in a news conference at Heathrow airport, also did not mention the draft resolution.  ``We are right to be optimistic about the way forward'' in Iraq, Hoon said.  International stability forces will be sent to Iraq as soon as possible, the U.S. official said, though it was unclear when that would be. Those troops will work to restore and maintain order and supervise humanitarian projects such as the restoration of water and electricity and delivery of food and medical aid.  The six nations contributing troops are Italy, Spain, Ukraine, Denmark, the Netherlands and Bulgaria, the official said. Representatives of those countries will meet with British officials May 7 and Polish officials May 22 to determine what forces each country will contribute and whether they will be put under British or Polish command.  The U.S. part of the stability force will be comprised of American troops. While that portion is likely to consist of a military division  _  about 20,000  _  the troop strength of the other two sectors has yet to be determined, the official said.  The international stabilization force would be under the U.S. war commander, Gen. Tommy Franks.  At least initially, the coalition stability forces will augment rather than replace the 135,000 American troops inside Iraq, the official said. The stability forces will focus on providing security and humanitarian relief while other U.S. troops focus on rooting out leftover members of Saddam Hussein's government and other armed elements in Iraq.  Rumsfeld said, however, that the more troops other countries contribute to the stability effort, the fewer U.S. troops will be needed inside Iraq.  Planning for both the U.N. resolution and the international security force left out France, Germany and Russia, three U.S. allies that vehemently opposed the war in Iraq.  Some of the NATO members who agreed to send troops may want NATO authorization for that action, the official said. Requests for such authorization will be routed through the alliance's defense planning committee, which does not include France, the official said.  The outlines for the international stability force were decided at a conference Hoon hosted Wednesday with representatives from 16 countries, mostly NATO members. Other countries including the Philippines, South Korea, Qatar and Australia agreed to send other help such as field hospitals, engineers, explosive ordnance disposal teams or nuclear, biological and chemical weapons experts.  The U.S., British and Polish sectors will be drawn to take into account ethnic, religious, tribal and political factions within Iraq, the official said. For example, although ethnic Kurds are the majority in large parts of northern Iraq, there are also large numbers of Kurds within Baghdad.  Some Arab countries also want to play a role in the stability operation in Iraq but are reluctant to send troops because of political, religious and ethnic considerations, the official said. Countries in the Gulf Cooperation Council have offered to donate money for the effort.  Rumsfeld also met Friday with King Abdullah of Jordan, an American ally in the Middle East. Defense officials say Jordan provided key help in the Iraq war, acting as a staging area for U.S. special operations raids into western Iraq to prevent missiles from being fired at Jordan or Israel.  Rumsfeld did not say what the two discussed.    .

   Spanish police intercept 33 exhausted Africans trying to enter Spain   MADRID, Spain (AP)  Police intercepted 33 African immigrants who came ashore Thursday in southern Spain aboard an overcrowded boat, including several pregnant women and other travelers suffering from hypothermia, police said.  Spanish media showed dramatic photos of police struggling to carry women on the verge of fainting after they were found wandering through Tarifa, Spain's windswept southern tip, Civil Guard officials told Spanish news agencies.  Police also arrested two Moroccan men suspected of trafficking in human beings and navigating the Zodiac boat across from Africa, Efe said.  Twenty-six of the would-be immigrants were from sub-Saharan Africa, six of them women, and the other seven were males from North African countries, police said.  Red Cross officials administered first aid on the scene, and the detainees were taken to a processing center for the government to begin expulsion proceedings.  Tens of thousands of destitute Africans try to enter Spain illegally each year by crossing the perilous Strait of Gibraltar to reach the southern mainland or by sailing northwest to the Canary Islands out in the Atlantic.  They seek a better life doing menial jobs in Spain or hope to use the country as a stepping stone to other points in Europe. Most are caught trying to sneak in and some die in the attempt.  (dw)    .

   Court suspends independent paper for publishing letters deemed religiously inflammatory   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP)  A state security court suspended a newspaper critical of the government Saturday after convicting it of publishing religiously inflammatory material, the newspaper's lawyer said.  The Khartoum Monitor may not appear for two months and must pay a fine of 1 million Sudanese pounds (about US$400), lawyer Ngor Olang Ngor told The Associated Press. Failure to pay the fine would result in a two-month extension of the suspension.  The sentence was the latest in a series of state actions against the Monitor, the only English language daily in Sudan and a leading critic of conditions in the south of the country, where a civil war has been waged for 20 years.  Ngor said the paper would pay the fine but it would also appeal the verdict.  The court ruling stated that the verdict and sentence would be submitted to the National Press Council, a government-appointed body, for approval, Ngor said.  The secretary general of the National Press Council, Hashim el-Jazz, did not answer repeated calls to his cell phone on Saturday.  The court convicted the paper of violating article 25 of the Press Law, which prohibits the publication of material that defames religion or incites religiously unacceptable activity.  The charges arose from letters-to-the-editor published last month that dealt with religion. One letter claimed that alcohol was not prohibited by Islam.  Earlier this week, security police detained the Monitor's managing editor, Nhial Bol, for 24 hours. On his release, he was charged with incitement of public discord for publishing the letters.  Sudan has an Islamic-orientated government and a substantial Christian minority.  In a separate action against the Monitor, security officials went to its editorial offices on Thursday night and told the management that it was being closed until it paid a fine of 15 million Sudanese pounds (about US$6,000) that was outstanding from a court conviction last year.  The Monitor did not appear Friday and its offices were closed.  In last year's trial, the paper was convicted of defaming the government for publishing that trains running to and from southern Sudan were used to transport abducted women and children.   mk-jbm     .

   North Korea may have fired laser at US aircraft, official says, as North nullifies accord to keep peninsula nuclear-weapons free   SEOUL, South Korea (AP)  North Korea's military may have fired a laser at a U.S. helicopter in March, a U.S. official said Tuesday, as the communist state ditched its last legal obligation to keep itself free of nuclear weapons.  The aircraft's censors detected the unknown type of laser while it was flying near the heavily fortified frontier that divides the two Koreas, the U.S. military official said on condition of anonymity. No one was injured and no equipment was damaged in the incident.  North Korea said Tuesday that a 1992 agreement with South Korea not to deploy nuclear arms on the Korean Peninsula was nullified, accusing the United States of derailing the deal.  ``The inter-Korean declaration on denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula was thus reduced to a dead document due to the U.S. vicious hostile policy to stifle the DPRK with nukes,'' said the North's official news agency, KCNA. DPRK stands for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the North's official name.  The announcement came as U.S. President George W. Bush and South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun were about to meet Wednesday in Washington to discuss North Korea's nuclear programs.  The accord was the last remaining legal obligation under which North Korea was banned from developing atomic arms. In January this year, North Korea withdrew from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, a global accord to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons.  A U.S. military official in Seoul, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Tuesday North Korea is believed to have exported US$580 million worth of missiles to Iran, Pakistan, Libya, Syria, Egypt, Yemen and the United Arab Emirates in 2001.  In December, a shipment of North Korean missiles bound for Yemen was briefly stopped in the Arabian Sea.  North Korea accuses the United States of planning to attack the communist country, which Bush has branded part of an ``axis of evil'' along with Iran and Iraq. It also revived its claim that the U.S. military keeps many nuclear weapons in South Korea, turning the country into ``the biggest nuclear advance base in the Far East.''  Washington says it wants to use dialogue to resolve the nuclear crisis, although U.S. officials have not ruled out a military option.  North Korea ``keenly felt that the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would only remain as a daydream unless the U.S. drops its hostile policy toward the DPRK,'' KCNA said.  It said the U.S. invasion of Iraq taught it that ``a war can be averted and the sovereignty of the country and the security of the nation can be protected only when a country has ... a strong military deterrent force capable of decisively repelling any attack to be made by any types of sophisticated weapons.''  In New York, South Korean President Roh said he will never condone North Korea's nuclear development, but Seoul and Washington agree the nuclear standoff with the North must be solved peacefully ``by all means.''  ``It is incumbent upon Pyongyang to give up its nuclear project and come forward as a responsible member of the international community,'' he said. ``When the North takes this route, the Republic of Korea and the international community will extend the necessary support and cooperation.''  Julianne Lee, a Roh spokeswoman, said the North Korean statement might be a negotiating ploy in the wake of talks last month with U.S. officials in Beijing.  During the talks in Beijing, U.S. officials said North Korea claimed it already possesses nuclear weapons, and that it had reprocessed 8,000 spent nuclear fuel rods  _  a move that could yield several atomic bombs within months.  North Korea offered to drop its nuclear and missile programs in exchange for security guarantees and economic aid, according to U.S. officials.  The nuclear crisis flared in October, when Washington said North Korea admitted having a secret nuclear program in violation of a 1994 treaty with Washington.    .

   Jordan rejects government critic's bid to run in June 17 parliamentary elections   AMMAN, Jordan (AP)  Jordanian authorities on Monday said Jordan's first female lawmaker was ineligible to run in June 17 parliamentary elections following her conviction last year over publishing information that harmed the government's reputation.  Toujan Faisal, 54, said she was informed of the refusal by an Interior Ministry committee overseeing election preparations.  ``The excuse is invalid because I've been convicted on political not criminal grounds, which doesn't violate my right for contesting the elections,'' Faisal told The Associated Press.  Faisal was convicted in May 2002 for publishing false and exaggerated information abroad that harmed the government's reputation and dignity. She was sentenced to 1{ years in jail.  But after spending 40 days in prison, Jordan's King Abdullah II pardoned the former legislator known for her harsh criticism of the state.  Jordan's electoral law bans Jordanians from contesting the polls if they were convicted of any crime, except political, and sentenced to more than one year in jail.  Government officials were not immediately available for comment.  During Faisal's 1993-97 stint in parliament, she became known as a fierce critic of the government and Muslim extremists and a champion of liberal views in conservative Jordan. She lost her seat in the 1997 election.	    snm-jjh/pg     .

   Explosion in Turkish cafe kills one person   ANKARA, Turkey (AP)  An explosion in a cafe at one of the capital's busiest intersections killed one woman and injured another Tuesday, police said.  Police were investigating the cause of the explosion in the restroom of the multistory Crocodile Cafe in the commercial district of Kizilay during the morning rush hour. The blast shattered walls and windows in the building.  Police recovered the body of a woman from the debris of the restroom and carried it away in a bodybag.  News reports suggested that the woman may have been a suicide bomber or may have died when the bomb she was planting exploded prematurely, but police and interior ministry officials refused to confirm the reports.  Ankara police chief Ercument Yilmaz visited the site of the morning blast but refused to say if a bomb had caused the explosion.  ``Our colleagues are carrying out inspections,'' he said. There was no information on the identity of the injured person.  It was not clear how many people were in the cafe at the time of the blast.  The explosion comes a month after a bomb exploded at a McDonald's restaurant in Istanbul, causing damage but no injuries.  Radical leftist, Kurdish and Islamic groups are active in the country and have carried out bombings in the past.    .

   Australia to keep open its embassy in Saudi Arabia With BC-ME-GEN--Saudi-Attacks   CANBERRA, Australia (AP)  Australia will keep open its embassy in Saudi Arabia despite decisions by the United States, Britain and Germany to close their diplomatic outposts in the country amid growing terror fears.  On the eve of a visit to the Saudi capital, Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said security at the Australian embassy appeared to be sufficient.  ``We have quite a substantial security presence at the Australian embassy in Riyadh and the ambassador thinks that that security presence is sufficient,'' Downer told the Australian Broadcasting Corp.  Australia is one of Washington's staunchest allies. Canberra sent troops to fight in the war on terror in Afghanistan and alongside U.S. and British forces in Iraq.  New Zealand also has no immediate plans to close its Saudi embassy.  On Tuesday, Saudi security officials said three suspected al-Qaida militants were arrested in Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, in sweeps following the near-simultaneous suicide attacks on three residential compounds on the outskirts of Riyadh on May 12. The bombings killed 34 people  _  including nine attackers, eight Americans and two Britons  _  and wounded nearly 200 others.  Earlier this week, Saudi and U.S. officials said they had new intelligence pointing to Osama bin Laden's al-Qaida group possibly launching fresh attacks in the United States or against American interests overseas.    .

   Israeli troops kill Palestinian boy and injure two other children in West Bank violence   JERUSALEM (AP)  Israeli troops shot and killed a 16-year-old Palestinian boy and critically injured two children, ages 7 and 9, during conflicts in the West Bank that erupted Tuesday as Israeli and Palestinian leaders moved toward talks on a new Mideast peace plan.  The shootings  _  which the Israeli army said came in response to attacks by Palestinians throwing stones and molotov cocktails  _ came a day after Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon declared that Israel's occupation in the West Bank must end, stunning both dovish opponents and hardline allies.  Sharon's remarks and Israel's conditional acceptance Sunday of the so-called ``road map'' to peace were expected to jump-start stalled Mideast peace negotiations.  A summit between Sharon and his Palestinian counterpart, Mahmoud Abbas, had been planned for Wednesday but was postponed, according to Israeli and Palestinian officials, who blamed each other for the delay. The officials said no new date had been set; Israel Radio said the meeting would take place Thursday.  A three-way summit with U.S. President George W. Bush could take place as early as next week, possibly in Jordan.  Israeli soldiers shot and killed a 16-year-old Palestinian boy and wounded a 7-year-old boy after opening fire at stone throwers in the Tulkarem refugee camp in the West Bank on Tuesday, Palestinian hospital officials said. The army said troops fired, and hit a boy, after a Palestinian youth threw a molotov cocktail.  In a village near the West Bank city of Nablus on Tuesday, Israeli troops opened fire on youths throwing stones, hitting a 9-year-old Palestinian boy in the head and critically wounding him, and hitting two 12-year-old boys in the legs, lightly wounding them, Palestinian hospital officials said. A 10-year-old boy was struck in the leg by a rubber bullet, but was not seriously hurt, the officials said.  Military sources said troops were trying to break up stone-throwing protests, but did not use live fire. The army was not aware of any injuries.  Five Palestinian children, a Palestinian woman and a police officer, were injured Tuesday after accidentally detonating explosives in the West Bank city of Hebron, Palestinian security officials said. The children found the explosives in two plastic bags under a tree and accidentally detonated the first bag. After a police officer arrived, the second bag exploded, seriously injuring him, the officials said.  Israeli troops killed a Palestinian teenager Monday and another surrendered after infiltrating from Gaza, the military said. They were unarmed and apparently looking for work. In a village near the West Bank town of Qalqiliya, an 11-year-old Palestinian boy was killed during an exchange of gunfire.  Also Monday, Israeli soldiers fired on four diplomatic vehicles in the northern Gaza town of Beit Hanoun, diplomats said. There were no injuries from the incident. Peter Lundberg, an official from the Swedish Consulate in Jerusalem, said that two bullets hit the windshield of the Swiss Consulate's armored car, and that small-arms fire also was directed at other cars from Sweden, Denmark and the European Union.  Military sources said the Israeli army had established roadblocks at the entrance to Beit Hanoun to prevent Palestinians militants from leaving the area. The sources said shots had been fired in the air when vehicles tried to skirt the roadblocks.  The violence erupted after Sharon endured withering criticism Monday from members of his own Likud Party over his Cabinet's acceptance of the U.S.-backed ``road map'' peace plan.  Sharon indicated a 180-degree turnaround after decades of warning that an Israeli withdrawal from even small parts of the West Bank could endanger Israel's existence.  Skeptics, however, wondered whether Sharon's conversion was a shrewd effort to deflect U.S. pressure in the hopes the road map would fail before Israel had to make tough concessions.  ``To keep 3.5 million people under occupation is bad for us and them,'' Sharon said in remarks broadcast on Israel Radio.  The term ``occupation'' is anathema to the Israeli right, which believes Israel has a legitimate claim to the West Bank and Gaza Strip for religious and security reasons.  Palestinians and their dovish Israeli allies routinely use the word ``occupation'' when demanding that Israel leave the West Bank and Gaza and dismantle Jewish settlements.  Palestinians claim all of the West Bank and Gaza for a state.  On Sunday, Sharon's Cabinet conditionally approved the ``road map,'' a three-phase plan that begins with a halt to violence and envisages a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 2005.  Sharon told party critics he was committed to finding a political solution to the conflict, including an Israeli withdrawal from West Bank population centers.  ``This can't continue endlessly. Do you want to remain forever in Ramallah, Jenin, Nablus?'' he asked.  Likud lawmakers charged that the road map was slanted in favor of the Palestinians and endangers Israel.  In his remarks Monday, Sharon left himself an out.  ``What will happen if Palestinian terror continues? Nothing. Nothing will happen. The Palestinians will get nothing,'' he said.  Critics have said Sharon's long-held condition that all violence must stop before peace moves is unrealistic and guarantees failure of any peace initiative, including the road map, thus releasing him from the necessity of following through on his remarks.  Liberal lawmaker Yossi Sarid argued Sharon was trying to keep his intentions murky to persuade the U.S. government that he was committed to the plan, while his hawkish allies could assume he was just making a tactical move to end U.S. pressure.  ``Ariel Sharon likes to walk in the fog, because then no one knows where he is headed,'' Sarid wrote in the Yediot Ahronot daily.	    pvs-lja     .

   U.S. lawmaker: North Korea says it will produce more nukes   SEOUL, South Korea (AP)  North Korea has told American lawmakers it already has nuclear weapons and intends to build more, a senior U.S. congressman said Monday after returning from a trip to the communist state.  ``They admitted to having nuclear capability and weapons at this moment,'' said Rep. Curt Weldon, who headed a delegation of U.S. lawmakers that visited Pyongyang for three days ending Sunday. ``They admitted to an effort to expand their nuclear production program.''  Weldon's comments echoed those of U.S. officials following talks in Beijing in April. They said that North Korea claimed during a pause in the formal talks that it already had nuclear weapons, but would give up the program in return for economic aid and security guarantees.  Weldon said at a news conference in Seoul that North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Kim Kye Gwan repeated that claim during a dinner meeting. Both Kim and Foreign Minister Paek Nam Sun told Weldon that Pyongyang planned to produce more nuclear weapons and had nearly finished reprocessing the spent nuclear fuel rods needed to do so, despite pressure from the United States and its allies.  ``They admitted to having just about completed the reprocessing of 8,000 rods,'' said Weldon, a Republican who is the No. 2 member of a U.S. House panel that oversees the armed forces.  U.S. experts say that reprocessing the rods could give North Korea several more nuclear bombs within months.  During their visit to Pyongyang, Weldon's delegation also met Choe Thae Bok, chairman of North Korea's legislature, the Supreme People's Assembly.  Although they were not traveling as envoys of U.S. President George W. Bush, they were the first American officials to visit since the nuclear standoff began in October. They flew to Seoul on Sunday to brief South Korean officials on their Northern trip.  North Korea said it was developing its nuclear weapons as ``a response to what they saw happened in Iraq, with the U.S. removing Saddam Hussein from power,'' Weldon said.  A North Korean foreign ministry spokesman was quoted as saying by state-run KCNA news agency that the visit helped both sides better understand each other and they shared the view that Washington and Pyongyang needed to avoid confrontation and exist peacefully.  ``They were of the same view that it is necessary to seek a negotiated settlement of the nuclear issue and expressed their stand that it is necessary to continue seeking and discussing ways of settling it,'' the spokesman said.  North Korea has repeatedly accused Washington of planing to invade. Bush says he prefers a diplomatic solution, but has not ruled out a military option.  In Seoul, South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun said his government has no ``clear proof'' to conclude North Korea has nuclear weapons.  ``North Korea has told important people of the United States that it has developed nukes and reprocessed spent fuel rods. But North Korea has not confirmed that to anyone else,'' Roh said. ``Thus, we must make a very careful judgment on whether we will conclude it has nuclear weapons or not, based on those words only.''  U.S. and South Korean officials say that North Korea may be bluffing about its nuclear program in an attempt to extract concessions from the United States. But U.S. Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz said Monday that the threat couldn't be ignored.  ``Certainly what we know suggests that we should take what they (North Korean officials) are saying very seriously,'' he said at a news conference in Seoul.  Weldon said his delegation ``comes away convinced'' that the nuclear standoff can be resolved in a peaceful manner that allows Pyongyang's communist regime to stand while removing its nuclear threats.  Roh issued a similar message during a nationally televised news conference.  ``South Korea and the United States share a firm principle that North Korea should never possess nuclear weapons and that the issue should be resolved through a peaceful manner,'' he said.  Roh spoke after meeting the U.S. lawmakers and Wolfowitz, who also arrived in Seoul on Sunday for a two-day visit to discuss North Korea.  Wolfowitz said Saturday in Singapore that Washington hoped putting pressure on North Korea's battered economy would resolve the nuclear standoff. On Monday, Wolfowitz stressed that military readiness was just as important.  In meetings with South Korean officials, Wolfowitz urged them to increase military spending on new technologies and telecommunications equipment, as U.S. forces have done. South Korea earmarks about US$14.5 billion for its military.  ``They still work with paper and pencil instead of with the kind of modern communications gear that our special forces took with them to Afghanistan,'' Wolfowitz said.  He said upgrades would allow troops to react quicker to threats from the North and help reduce the possibility of a military conflict on the peninsula, not heighten it.  The nuclear crisis flared last October when U.S. officials said North Korea admitted running a secret nuclear weapons program in violation of a 1994 accord with Washington.    .

   State refused bid to prosecute acquitted apartheid germ warfare head   BLOEMFONTEIN, South Africa (AP)  South Africa's Supreme Court of Appeal ruled Tuesday against a state request to retry the head of apartheid's germ warfare program, once accused of plotting to poison Nelson Mandela.  Wouter Basson was acquitted in April 2002 on 46 charges, ranging from murder and drug trafficking to fraud and theft.  Basson was accused of directing South Africa's former apartheid regime's biochemical efforts aimed at destroying its opponents.  The ruling by judges Piet Streicher and Mohamed Navsa of the Supreme Court of Appeal, the highest appeals court in the country, means that Basson cannot be tried again and his acquittal stands, the South African Press Association reported.  The state's appeal was based on the judge refusing to recuse himself during Basson's 2 1/2-year trial. The prosecution alleged presiding Judge Willie Hartzenberg favored Basson.  The appeal judges found Hartzenberg's refusal did not relate to an error of law on his part.  Basson headed a program named Project Coast in the 1980's.  During the trial witnesses testified that the project involved trying to create deadly bacteria and anti-fertility drugs that would only affect blacks. They poisoned opponents' clothing and stockpiled cholera, HIV and anthrax.  The alleged intended victims included former President Nelson Mandela and several African National Congress leaders who are now high-ranking government officials.  He had also been accused of siphoning millions of dollars from Project Coast to finance a lavish, globe-trotting lifestyle and of selling drugs.	       (sapa-es-dk)    .

   Seven convicted in Vietnamese crime boss' trial to appeal their sentences   HANOI, Vietnam (AP)  Seven people convicted last week in Vietnam's biggest-ever criminal trial, including two former senior government officials, have requested an appeal of the verdicts, a court official said Tuesday.  The seven include former state radio director Tran Mai Hanh and former vice national chief prosecutor Pham Sy Chien, both convicted of receiving bribes, the court official said on condition of anonymity.  The trial by a Ho Chi Minh City court was seen as a litmus test of the communist government's resolve to fight widespread corruption.  The ``godfather'' of organized crime, Truong Van Cam  _  better known as Nam Cam  _  was convicted of seven crimes, including murder. He was sentenced to face a firing squad, and his lawyer has said he also plans to appeal.  Hanh, also a former member of the powerful Communist Party Central Committee, was convicted of receiving US$8,500 in bribes from Nam Cam's family to secure the crime boss' early release from labor camp in 1990s. Hanh was sentenced to 10 years in jail.  Chien was convicted of receiving a stereo set worth 27 million dong (US$1,750) from Nam Cam's family and sentenced to six years in jail.  Five other people who were sentenced up to five years in jail for crimes such as gambling and receiving bribes have also filed appeals, the official said.  A total of 155 defendants stood trial during the three months of proceedings. All but five were convicted. One defendant was acquitted, while the court sent four other cases back to police for further investigation.  Under Vietnamese law, the convicted have 15 days to appeal their sentences.    .

   Mars rover is launched on voyage to look for evidence of water   CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida (AP)  A rocket holding the first of two Mars rovers blasted off Tuesday on a seven-month voyage to the red planet where the golf-cart-sized vehicles will search for evidence that there was once enough water to support life on Mars.  The rover named Spirit lifted off from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station aboard a Boeing Delta II rocket at 1:58 p.m. (1758 GMT).  Thunderstorms delayed the launch by two days, and launch officials contended with a last-minute communications glitch between stations that will track the spacecraft.  The second rover, named Opportunity, will be launched later this month, and both are expected to arrive at Mars in January.  Moving on six wheels, the $800 million rovers act as robotic geologists. Each is equipped with a panoramic camera, a camera for close-up views of rocks and a drill to cut into rocks. The data will be transmitted back to Earth.  Previous missions have shown Mars had water in the past, but scientists want to find out how long the water was there and in what quantities. Scientists believe the water may show that Mars once was able to support life.  The rovers' landing sites, on opposite sides of the planet, were chosen for their likelihood of holding evidence of water. Studying the minerals in rocks can tell scientists how the rocks were formed, whether they were ever submerged in water, and whether hot water ever ran over them.  The rovers are expected to travel up to 132 feet (39.6 meters) each Martian day, which is 24 hours and 39{ minutes long.  The missions are expected to last three months but could run longer. The rovers eventually will shut down as dust builds up on their solar panels and they will remain on the planet.  Only 12 out of 30 previous attempts have reached Mars, and only three out of nine attempts have succeeded in landing on the planet.  NASA revamped its Mars program after the failure of two unmanned missions to Mars four years ago.  The space agency has been under intense scrutiny since February when the space shuttle Columbia disintegrated over Texas, killing all seven crew members. A logo patch of that last Columbia mission was attached to both Mars rovers.	    _	_  _  =  On the Net:  Rover Mission: http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mer    .

   Retired navy officer regrets involvement in bungled plot to protect Ocalan   ATHENS, Greece (AP)  A retired navy officer facing life in prison over a failed effort to protect Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, told a court Thursday he felt remorse for his part in the 1999 plot.  ``I have a guilty conscience,'' Andonis Naxakis said during his two-hour testimony.  Naxakis is one of 13 people on trial for bringing the fugitive guerrilla leader to Greece. Ocalan was moved by the government to its embassy compound in Kenya, where he was captured by Turkish commandos.  The retired Greek officer said he had been trying to get Ocalan to The Netherlands, home to a large Kurdish community.  He claimed he had been manipulated by the government.  ``I believe I was unwittingly used as bait for its disgraceful plan ... an organized move by the government to hand Ocalan over to Turkey,'' he said.  Naxakis and two of Ocalan's Kurdish associates are being tried on criminal charges of endangering national security. Ocalan, being tried in absentia, was indicted for entering the country illegally, a misdemeanor.  Ocalan, leader of the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, is serving a life sentence in Turkey for leading a 15-year insurgency against the country that left 37,000 people dead.  He is being tried in Greece in absentia.    .

   U.S. LIKELY TO WAIT, REGROUP BEFORE ATTACKING BAGHDAD   04-03-03 02:16:00EST  By EDWARD EPSTEIN  c.2003 SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE  WASHINGTON _ Having punched through severely depleted Republican Guard divisions that formed Baghdad's outer defensive ring, U.S. Army and Marine forces are likely to pause again to test the Iraqi capital's inner defenses and waall but evaporated under the weight of the U.S. assault. Their collapse left the U.S. troops less than 20 miles from Saddam Hussein's capital. Bet`fow Central Command chief Gen. Tommy Franks and his field commanders face a big decision _ whether to rush into the city of 5 million where Hussein's regime has gathered its most-trusted forces or wait and see if the war can be won without paying the price of street-to-street urban fighting.  ``We are expectingn or at least planning for, a very difficult fight ahead,'' Gen. Stanley McChrystal said at the Pentagon Tuesday. ``We are not expecting to drive into Baghdad suddenly and seize it.''  Instead of an all-out assault, analysts expect the United States to follow the example of British forces outside the southern Iraqi city of Basra. They are likely to mount small probing patrols into the city to determine the level of Iraqi resistance.  If these patrols meet little opposition, thousands of troops could rush into the city. If the Iraqis respond forcefully, the Army and Marine units could withdraw and await the 4th Mechanized Infantry Division, which will soon start moving north from Kuwait. While they wait, the forces would try to determine where Iraqi strong points are within the city and where Hussein might be, if he is still alive.  ``The Basra model will work for a while, at least until you see problems with food and water for civilians in the city,'' said Lawrence Korb, an analyst at the Council on Foreign Relations who was assistant defense secretary under former President Ronald Reagan.  ``Before going in (with a full assault), you have to decide if it's worth the risks, and ... you have to know who's there in the way of Iraqi forces and the amount of potential damage to civilians,'' he said.  The administration has said it wants to minimize casualties to Iraqi civilians, which makes the British experience around Basra instructive, the analysts said. The British have been outside the city of 1.5 million for more than a week. Thousands of refugees have fled the city, apparently providing information to the British that has led to raids on military and Baath Party sites in the city.  ``The key endgame may be whether the U.S. can parse out the key regime centers of power in Baghdad and attack them without having to fight into the city, or at least locate them well enough to atman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies said in his daily war report.  U.S. strategists say that Hussein, if he is still alive and in control of his forces, might like a bloody battle in Baghdad because such fighting could cause heavy U.S. casualties. His last hope for survival might be that the United States loses its taste for such losses and forces President Bush to negotiate a compromise that would allow Hussein and his family to keep power in Baghdad.  But Michael O'Hanlon of the Brookings Institution in Washington said the apparent collapse of Republican Guard resistance could deprive Hussein of much of the wallop he was counting on in the city.  ``If U.S. forces seriously degrade Iraq's half-dozen Republican Guard divisions before that final battle, and only have to face perhaps 30,000 Special Republican Guard, fedayeen, and related personnel, the task will not be as hard as it might have been,'' he said.  While two guard divisions have apparently been smashed, there are three others in the Baghdad area. A sixth remains in northern Iraq.  Cordesman said it seems the guards have been reinforced by units from the regular Iraqi army, which is generally viewed as less reliable. This shows the Iraqi military's growing weakness, he said.  ``The Republican Guard has taken a massive hammering at every level and is now scattered and deploying somewhat erratically at the brigade level,'' he said.  The Iraqis still haven't used chemical weapons, even though many experts feared such attacks as the U.S. troops neared Baghdad. Korb, who's convinced Hussein has stocks of chemical weapons he never reported to U.N. inspectors, said he wouldn't be surprised if Hussein tried to use them.  But he also said, ``He may destroy them to embarrass us,'' to show the world he never had such weapons and that Bush invaded for no reason other than aggression.  The U.S. forces zeroing in on Baghdad _ the 1st Marine Division from the east and the Army's 3rd Mechanized Infantry Division _ are trained in urban warfare. But in such close-quarters fighting, they would lose much of the technological advantage of their air supremacy, which would have to be curtailed because bombing in a city can cause large civilian casualties.  However, Baghdad from the air looks like Los Angeles _ wide, straight boulevards intersected by side streets in a grid pattern. ``Our forces would be capable of dealing with it reasonably. But there would be lots of casualties on all sides,'' Korb said.    .

   CHEEKS CAN INTERVIEW WITH SIXERS   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.   Portland Trail Blazers coach Maurice Cheeks received permission Monday to interview for the Philadelphia 76ers' vacant coaching job, possibly dooming the candidacy of Eddie Jordan, a Nets assistant who interviewed for that same position earlier this week.  Cheeks, a former Sixers star, is believed to be Philadelphia's top choice to replace Larry Brown, who resigned last week as coach and was introduced Monday as the coach of the Detroit Pistons.  Portland finally gave Cheeks the go-ahead to interview with the Sixers, according to a league source familiar with the discussions. The Cleveland Cavaliers also formally introduced Paul Silas as their coach Monday.  Jordan met with the Sixers on Sunday, according to a person close to the situation. Jordan declined to comment on the conversation.  While Jordan has been rumored to be a candidate for a number of spots, only Toronto and Philadelphia have inquired about him.  Brown takes over a team that won an Eastern Conference-leading 50 games and advajcuf to the conference finals before being swept by the Nets. Detroit holds the No. 2 pick in the upcoming NBA draft.  Silas is taking over a team that lost 65 games and will pin its future on the high school phenom LeBron James.    .

   CIA SAYS NORTH KOREA HAS NEW NUCLEAR TESTING SITE AND TECHNOLOGY   WASHINGTON   U.S. intelligence officials now believe North Korea is developing the technology to make nuclear warheads small enough to fit atop the country's growing arsenal of missideS( potentially putting Tokyo and U.S. troops based in Japan at risk, according to officials who have received the intelligence reports.  In the assessment, which they have shared with Japan, South Korea and other allies in recent weeks, officials at the Central Intelligence Agency said that U.S. satellites have identified a sophisticated new nuclear testing site in an area called Youngdoktong. At the site, equipment has been set up to test conventional explosives that, when detonated, could compress a plutonium core and set onfe nuclear explosion.  [oMa intelligence officials believe that the existence of the testing range is evidence that the country intends to manufacture much more sophisticated weapons that would be light enough to put onto its growing arsenal of medium- and long-range missiles. Previously, U.S. officials had said they were uncertain whether North Korea had received enough outside technical help to even attempt to make such a ``miniaturized'' nuclear warhead. The new testing capability would suggest that the North Koreans are getting closer _ now, officials said, the intelligence reports say they could do in in as little as a year or less. But officials say there is no sure way of knowing that they can until they actually test one.  Senior administration officials say that Washington has been trying to convince Asiagent that it requires a unified diplomatic front to force the country to give up its weapons. The new intelligence is apparently being marshaled to support the administration's argument.  According to officials who have been briefed on the U.S. reports, conventional explosions simulating a nuclear detonation have been set off at the testing site, which is near North Korea's main nuclear complex. North Korea has never tested a nuclear weapon, though the CIA long ago estimated that it manufactured two crude devices in the late 1980s or early 1990s.  North Korea, unlike Iraq, has made no secret of its plan to develop nuclear weapons. Now, administration officials say they fear that the country is on the verge of producing five or six new weapons, some of which might be miniaturized.   ``This would give them the range they never had before, and the chance to spread their threat far beyond South Korea,'' said one senior Asian official, noting that approximately 60,000 U.S. troops are based in Japan. ``It changes the dynamics of the problem.''  The new intelligence estimates provided to Asian allies, however, left it unclear how quickly the North could produce the small warheads. The worst-case estimate, officials say, is that they could do so in less than a year.  (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)  U.S. satellites have been watching North Korean nuclear activity intently since late last year, when the North evicted international inspectors. Those inspectors had stood guard over a collection of 8,000 spent nuclear fuel rods, which can be reprocessed into weapons-grade plutonium.  In January the country began to re-start its nuclear rexrOgessing equipment, which had been mothballed for nearly a decade under a 1994 agreement with the Clinton administration. But according to U.S. officials, it now appears that North Korean engineers ran into technical problems in restarting the facilities. While intelligence officials have reached no consensus, they told allies last week that in the worst case, only a few hundred of the 8,000 rods had been converted into plutonium. It would take 1,000 to 1,500 rods to make enough plutonium for a weapon, experts say.O  ``What we are told is that it would take perhaps six months after that to produce a miniaturized warhead, and put it into one of the missiles,'' said one senior official who has recently reviewed the intelligence. ``But after Iraq, who knows how good those estimates are?''  After the claims made about prohibited weapons in Iraq, which have not been found so far, skepticism about the quality of U.S. intelligence is widespread. And in the case of North Korea, as in Iraq, the immediacy of the threat depends on whose analysis seems most compelling.  So far, U.S. intelligence has picked up almost no sign of the telltale krypton gas that is released into the atmosphere when nuclear fuel rods are converted into weapons-grade plutonium. This has led some analysts to argue that the North Koreans may be farther from producing a weapon than feared a few months ago.  But others note that trucks were seen carrying the rods out of their normal storage area months ago, and it is unclear where they are _ or even whether the United States is sniffing for the krypton gas in the right place.  ``We don't believe that the main reprocessing facility has been very active,'' said one senior administration official in a recent interview. ``But could there be a second reprocessor? No one knows for sure.''  Without question, though, North Korea's capabilities greatly outstrip anything Iraq has had in the past decade, and North Korea's program is probably several years ahead of Iran's.  President Bush and South Korea's new president, Roh Moo-h is unclear whether they interpret the meaning of that phrase the same way. Bush has said he wants a diplomatic solution to the problem, but would not foreclose any option, including military options. Roh has said any pre-emptive strike against the North's nuclear facilities could prove disastrous.    .

   Five killed in coalition bombing on Baghdad   BAGHDAD, March 24 (Xinhua)  Five Iraqi civilians, including a woman, were killed Monday when their houses were hit by a missile fired by the US-led coalition warplanes, witnesses said.  Their houses are located in Al-Azamiyah, one of the most populous areas in the Iraqi capital of Baghdad, they said.  One house was destroyed during the strike and casualties have been removed from the area.  The US-led coalition forces launched a new round of airstrikes on Baghdad at 2:30 p.m. (1130GMT) on Monday.  Huge explosions were heard in different parts of Baghdad and air raid siren sounded throughout the capital city, they said, adding that Iraqi anti-aircraft artillery had begun to fire back.  Although the coalition leaders have repeatedly assured that every effort would be made to minimize civilian casualties in the current Iraq war, at least 130 Iraqi civilians have been reportedly killed since the war started five days ago.  According to other reports reaching here, five Syrian bus passengers were killed and 10 others were injured on Sunday morning when a US missile hit the bus they were traveling in near the Iraqi border.  The vehicle was carrying Syrians fleeing the war in Iraq.    .

   Roundup: UK, US downplay divide on UN role in post-war Iraq   BELFAST, Britain, April 8 (Xinhua)  A two-day summit between British Prime Minister Tony Blair and US President George W. Bush ended here Tuesday with both countries trying to minimize splits on UN role in rebuilding Iraq after the ongoing US-led war against the country is over.  As the US-led coalition troops are reportedly thrusting into Baghdad and the second Iraqi city of Basra, Blair and Bush agreed there would be a "vital role" for the United Nations in post-war Iraq.  During their first war summit on March 27 at Camp David,  Blair and Bush became divided over what a role the United Nations will play in postwar Iraq, when Bush gave no positive reaction to Blair 's suggestion of a strong UN role.  After the Camp David talks, Blair, who analysts say has been pursuing a special relationship with Washington in order to restore Britain's traditional role as a transatlantic "bridge", was forced to readjust his tone.  Blair and Bush were expected to bridge their gap on the issue by reaching an agreement on UN role in post-war Iraq, some analysts said even before this summit at Hillsborough, south of Belfast, the second of its kind since the war broke out on March 20.  In a joint written statement, the two allies pledged to seek UN Security Council resolutions to affirm Iraq's territorial integrity, ensure aid delivery and endorse an "appropriate" post- conflict administration for Iraq.  "We welcome the appointment by the United Nations Secretary- General of a special adviser for Iraq to work with the people of Iraq and coalition representatives," the statement added.  The United Nations would have a "vital role" in the effort to repair Iraq's infrastructure, Blair told reporters at a news conference after his talks with Bush, downplaying UN role in emphasizing that ultimately the country must be run by the Iraqi people.  "The key is that Iraq in the end should be governed by the Iraqi people," Blair said, pledging that British and US forces would not stay in the country "a day longer than necessary".  It was a "false choice" to debate whether Iraq should be run by coalition forces or the United Nations, said Blair, who was believed to be in favor of a stronger UN role in post-conflict Iraq than Bush.  Echoing Blair, Bush said the UN would play a role in all aspects of post-war Iraq, from humanitarian aid to a future interim authority, adding that Iraq would "move as quickly as possible" to an interim authority made up of Iraqis from inside and outside the country.  However, when pressed on what precisely the UN role would be, Bush on Tuesday mentioned only humanitarian work, "suggesting" people to staff the interim authority and helping Iraq "progress."  "When we say vital role for the United Nations, we mean vital role for the United Nations in all aspects of the issue, whether it be humanitarian aid, or whether it be helping to stand up an interim authority. The Iraqi people will decide who's on the Iraqi interim authority," said Bush.  Bush did not spell out how much power the United Nations would have, nor did he elaborate on Washington's plans to place US officials alongside Iraqis in the interim administration.  Differences still remain between the United States and Britain, analysts said, over the speed with which Iraq should be handed to an interim Iraqi administration, and the extent to which a US-led group of generals and former diplomats should effectively run the country.  Yet, analysts argued, both Britain and the United States hope their agreed vision of a postwar scenario will placate anti-war nations such as France, Germany and Russia.  "We will move as quickly as possible to place governmental responsibilities under the control of an interim authority composed of Iraqis from both inside and outside the country," Bush vowed at the joint news conference with Blair, adding that the interim authority would serve until a permanent government could be chosen by the Iraqi people.  "Rebuilding of Iraq will require the support and expertise of the international community. We are committed to working with international institutions, including the United Nations, which will have a vital role to play in this task," Bush added.  Blair also pleaded the world to avoid "endless diplomatic wrangles" over the future of Iraq like the international dispute over a second UN resolution on Iraq that preceded the war.  France and Germany, which were most vocal in opposing this US- led war against Iraq, have been insisting that the United Nations should play a central role in the phase of post-war Iraq.  On the unresolved dispute between Europe and the United States, analysts say, Blair might again have to make a difficult choice, but he is very likely to support the United States, which Britain can not afford to fall out with.    .

   hka -- Macao traces passengers on flight with suspected SARS infector   MACAO, April 16 (Xinhua)  Four Macao residents have been notified by the Health Services that they shared the same plane with a Taiwanese suspected to have contracted Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) on April 8.  The Health Services urged the four residents to contact the authority immediately to report their health condition.  According to the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for suspected cases, these four residents need not to be isolated, however, they should seek treatment immediately if they have any SARS symptoms.  In order to improve the epidemic control, Secretary for Social Affairs and Culture Chui Sai On, who has been named director of the SARS task force by the government, has designated representatives from the Health Services and the Center for Disease Prevention and Control to visit neighboring Guangdong Province on Thursday, to learn from Guangdong's experience and know-how in combating SARS, which have been acknowledged by WHO.  No suspected SARS case had been found at medical consultation counters at Macao's three ports of entry as of Wednesday.  In case that any SARS infection is confirmed, the task force will quickly take round-the-clock command and make news release every six hours, Chui said.    .

   Indonesian Muslim cleric stands trial for treason   JAKARTA, April 23 (Xinhua)  The Central Jakarta District Court began Wednesday the trial of Muslim cleric Abu Bakar Ba' asyir who has been in custody since last October on charges of treason and immigration offenses.  Ba'asyir, 64, was arrested on preliminary charges of involvement in a series of church bombings on the eve of the 2000 Christmas and an alleged plot to assassinate  Megawati Soekarnoputri in 1999, when she was vice president.  He is also charged with immigration offenses for having a Malaysian citizenship since 1993.  Seven prosecutors read in turn the indictment against Ba'asyir at the makeshift court room in the Meteorology and Geophysics Agency's office in Central Jakarta.  The authorities have moved the trial venue for security reasons and to allow wider media coverage.  Ba'asyir was not officially charged with the Bali bombing last October, but police said he gave his blessing to the Bali perpetrators. Police believed Ba'asyir was the spiritual leader of Jemaah Islamiyah, the terrorist network in Southeast Asia which is widely blamed for the Bali bombing.  According to the Criminal Code, treason is punishable with a possible death penalty.  Ba'asyir has publicly denied any wrongdoing and refused to answer police questioning.    .

   None allowed in Pakistan for nefarious designs: minister   ISLAMABAD, April 25 (Xinhua)  "No one would be allowed to live in Pakistan illegally and use its land for achieving their nefarious designs," Information Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed said on Friday.  Rashid Ahmed made the remarks when his attention was drawn to the recent visit by Afghan President Hamid Karzai, according to the Associated Press of Pakistan.  Rashid said that Pakistan has very good relations with the brotherly country of Afghanistan.  When asked to comment on the trans-national gas pipeline projects, he said, four countries including Qatar, Turkmenistan and Iran are deliberating upon the projects which will go a long way in strengthening the economies of the participating countries.  Earlier on Thursday, President Pervez Musharraf said Pakistan wants peace and stability in Afghanistan as it would be in "our interest."  Pakistan, he said, would benefit immensely from stability in Afghanistan as its trade with Central Asian countries will take place through it.  Referring to al-Qaeda, Musharraf said that no non-Pakistani would be allowed to live in Pakistan without proper documents.  "We have to see if their cause is Islamic or in Pakistan's interest -- they have their own political agenda -- they should not harm Pakistan's interests."    .

   Colombian guerrillas urge prisoner swap with gov't   BOGOTA, May 12 (Xinhua)  The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) said Monday that it was prepared to exchange prisoners with the government despite the death of 10 hostages held by the rebel group.  The FARC sought the exchange of more than 70 politicians, soldiers and policemen in its control for nearly 500 rebels imprisoned by the government, said Luis Devia, also known as Raul Reyes, a FARC leader, in a letter sent to the program Noticias Uno.  On May 5, 10 hostages held by the FARC were killed during an attempt to rescue them by the army.  The victims were Antioquia Governor Guillermo Gaviria, former Defense Minister Gilberto Echeverry and eight soldiers.  Reyes said in his letter that the "guerrilla units are in the moral obligation of saving and protecting lives and physical integrity of their prisoners."  The rebels "in any case cannot allow to have its prisoners to be taken away by enemy forces without a military response," he added.  The 17,000-strong FARC, the largest guerrilla force in Colombia, has been fighting a war against the government for more than 40 years, leaving 400,000 dead. It is still holding hundreds of hostages including three Americans.    .

   Philippine government dismisses Estrada still-be-president claim   MANILA, May 23 (Xinhua)  The Philippine Presidential Palace Friday dismissed as an "old tune" deposed leader Joseph Estrada's claim that he was still the country's legitimate president.  Presidential Chief of Staff Rigoberto Tiglao said Estrada's camp was trying to revive the issue on the legality of President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo's administration when this was upheld twice by the Supreme Court.  "This is an old tune as far as the Palace is concerned," Tiglao said hours after Estrada petitioned the anti-graft court, the Sandiganbayan, to dismiss the government charges against him, citing "lack of jurisdiction" since he was still the president.  Meanwhile, the court shrugged off the claim of Estrada's lawyer Alan Paguia that its ruling on the legitimacy of the Arroyo administration was illegal and cautioned that the tribunal's decision was final and could not be overturned by the Sandiganbayan.  The Sandiganbayan Special Division Friday reset for June 16 the resumption of Estrada's plunder case hearing, which was originally scheduled for June 2.  Estrada, who was ousted in a military-backed popular revolt in January 2001, has been detained for almost two years at the Veterans Memorial Medical Center in Metro Manila on plunder charges.    .

   Czech president appoints new defense minister   PRAGUE, June 9 (Xinhua)  Czech President Vaclav Klaus on Monday appointed Miroslav Kostelka as the country's new defense minister to replace Jaroslav Tvrdik who resigned from the post in late May.  The decision was made in response to the recommendation of Prime Minister Vladimir Spidla.  Kostelka, 52, was first deputy defense minister and an ex- general.  At the end of last month, Tvrdik submitted his resignation in protest against planned cuts in defense spending as part of the government's finance reforms.  Under the planned package of public finance reforms, only 2.05 percent of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) will be allocated for the defense budget. Tvrdik said the military reform could not be completed thoroughly with so little money.  Tvrdik, who took over the defense ministry in May 2001, also announced that he would quit his post in the parliament and give up his position in the ruling party Social Democrats.  Prime Minister Spidla said Monday that the ongoing military reform should continue, with regard to the government's planned public finance reforms.  The appointment marked the second change of the cabinet post since the Spidla-led government came into power in July 2002.    .

   US pharmaceutical company founder sentenced to 87 months in prison   WASHINGTON, June 10 (Xinhua)  Sam Waksal, founder of the US pharmaceutical company ImClone Systems was sentenced to 87 months in prison Tuesday for insider trading.  Waksal was also ordered to pay more than 4 million dollars in fines and back taxes. This order came after about two hours' legal proceedings at the Manhattan courthouse in New York, according to a TV report.  Before the sentence, there had been speculations among analysts on whether Waksal would get leniency because his company has been working on researches of cancer drugs, a good endeavor in the eyes of many people.  ImClone's Erbitux drug has been recently accepted to be effective in helping cancer patients. But the order just released from the courthouse in New York has obviously separated Waksal's good efforts in making new drugs from his legal problems.  Amid the financial storms last year and the ensuing cracking down on corporate malfeasance, Waksal pleaded guilty in October to charges involving his efforts to sell a huge block of his company' s stock in late 2001.  The attempt to sell the shares were just before ImClone shares plunged on the news that the Food and Drug Administration rejected ImClone's application to sell the experimental cancer drug, Erbitux.  This incident then triggered legal investigations, which also included the case of a US media and domestic design diva, Martha Stewart.    .

   EU backs stricter nuclear inspections in Iran   LUXEMBOURG, June 16 (Xinhua)  Foreign ministers of the European Union (EU) said here Monday that they fully supported stricter nuclear inspections of Iran's nuclear programs by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).  A statement issued at the two-day meeting of the EU foreign ministers called on Iran to conclude and implement urgently and unconditionally an additional protocol to the Nuclear Non- Proliferation Treaty allowing for short-notice inspections of suspected nuclear sites in the country.  It said that the EU was seriously concerned about Iran's nuclear activities and urged it to cooperate fully with the IAEA.  "This would be a significant step in demonstrating Iran's stated peaceful intentions with regard to its nuclear program," the seven-point statement said.  George Papandreou, foreign minister of Greece, the current holder of the EU presidency, said he was in personal contact with IAEA Director-General Mohamed ElBaradei and would follow his lead on this matter.  EU foreign ministers reiterated that improved trade links with Iran should be conditional on Iran's cooperation.  They also said that the EU was closely following the nuclear issue and would revert it to the forthcoming debate of the IAEA meeting on Tuesday.    .

   China to build nuclear-powered desalinator project   JINAN, June 24 (Xinhua)  China late this year will start building a nuclear-powered desalinator project in Yantai City in east China's Shandong Province, with a designed capacity of producing 52 million tons of fresh water a year.  Officials with the Development Planning Commission of the Shandong provincial government said the project, to be built in cooperation with Qinghua University, would alleviate water shortages in the city and other parts of the Shandong Peninsula.  Yantai and other parts of Shandong suffered acute water shortages due to droughts in recent years, changing climate and other reasons.  Approved by the State Development and Reform Commission, the project is expected to cost 1.6 billion yuan (nearly 200 million US dollars).  Zhang Zuoyi, director of the Nuclear Energy Technology and Design Institute attached to Qinghua University, was quoted in Monday's Beijing Evening News as saying the fresh water to be produced from the project will cost 3.75 yuan per ton, much less than the cost of water from existing sources.  The project is expected to use a 200-megawatt nuclear-powered reactor designed by the institute, according to the paper.  The project would be completed and operational in 2007, it said.    .

   member of the uacc     Sue H   Thu, 24 Feb 2005 12:38:06 -0500   member of the uacc   there is a lady by the name of Irene Sokolas that is selling on Ebay under VARIOUS names. She is saying she's a member of the UACC. She is selling FORGERIES. I have contacted the UACC and told them about it so they can check the auctions (she's been doing this a long time) and to tell me if she's actually a registered member.  I would suggest everyone read the body of the entire item they're bidding on. EVERYTHING. If you see her name, stay clear. No matter WHICH ID she's using. Also, I have seen in the past, others reselling items usuing her COA's. Be careful.  I am miffed the UACC would not check into people before allowing them to be members if in fact she is a member. But I will reserve judgement till they respond.  This makes one really skeptical. But if you see a UACC member on Ebay, don't automatically assume they are legit. Contact the UACC before buying and ask if they are a member. If you suspect something is fake, do not take it for granted it's legit because a UACC number is attached to it. In cases where the member claims and IS a UACC member, still question and then if you suspect there are a number of fakes by that person, do NOT hesitate to let the UACC and Ebay know.  Hope I spared someone here of potential grief and saved someone some money!     Sue H   Thu, 24 Feb 2005 13:16:25 -0500   Re: member of the uacc   Ooops; spelling of ladies last name was off.

   Indonesia warned about tsunamis     EW   Tue, 28 Dec 2004 09:09:36 -0500   Re: Indonesia warned about tsunamis         "Minutes after a massive earthquake rocked the Indian Ocean on Sunday, international ocean monitors knew that a tsunami would likely follow. But they didn't know whom to tell.  "We put out a bulletin within 20 minutes, technically as fast as we could do it," says Jeff LaDouce of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. LaDouce says e-mails were dispatched to Indonesian officials, but he doesn't know what happened to the information."  It looks more like the Indonesian officials weren't sitting at their computer or didn't have their email client set for 10 minute checks for new mail. Email! For Heaven's sake, get with the real world. It's too bad those NOAA people hadn't used the telephone.  I wonder if the (few) lives they could have saved if they'd used a modicum of common sense will prey on their minds.     Joe727   Tue, 28 Dec 2004 14:46:35 GMT   Re: Indonesia warned about tsunamis          Well, I have yet to hear that scientists from any other country even made the attempt the American scientists made.  Perhaps the Indonesian government should have taken steps to set up a hotline of sorts that could be used in case of such emergencies. As the article notes, the American scientists did not know who to contact. That's hardly their problem, let alone their fault.

A voice on the other end of the line says he's a scientist with NOAA and that a tsunami is bearing down on your coastal villages and resorts. Thousands could die. How would you react to such a call?  I thought so.  All the more reason that the Indonesian government should have taken steps to set up a hotline of sorts that could be used in case of such emergencies.  Joe     Eugene Gallagher   Tue, 28 Dec 2004 10:38:02 -0500   Re: Indonesia warned about tsunamis          The Boston Globe points out that New England has no system in place to warn residents of tidal waves, which are known to happen off New England.

Joe727   Tue, 28 Dec 2004 15:47:40 GMT   Re: Indonesia warned about tsunamis          The entire East Coast of the U.S. does not have a tsunami warning system.  Joe     William Asher   28 Dec 2004 16:36:47 GMT   Re: Indonesia warned about tsunamis          On the other hand, if you were a scientist at NOAA and were into saving people from tsunamis, you would think you might have figured out beforehand who you might call if you did get some advanced warning of such an event. Also, the Indonesian government probably had no idea that NOAA could give them advanced warning of tsunamis so how could they know they should set up a hotline.  So it cuts both ways, the Indonesian government should have done some prior planning, but so too should the NOAA scientists. You can bet they are figuring out who they should have call next time.  -- Bill "20/20 Hindsight" Asher     Joe727   Tue, 28 Dec 2004 17:00:23 GMT   Re: Indonesia warned about tsunamis          It's not the responsibility of NOAA to set up hotlines to governments around the world. The Indonesian government should have contacted the U.S. State Department and provided U.S. officials with the contact info.  Joe     EW   Tue, 28 Dec 2004 12:24:30 -0500   Re: Indonesia warned about tsunamis          Do you think they warned the USAF boys in Diego Garcia? It's highest point is only 20' above sea level.

Peter   Tue, 28 Dec 2004 15:34:40 -0500   Re: Indonesia warned about tsunamis         FWIK the Indian ocean was not considered a tsunami prone area.

There has been no contact with her since she left.  -- Peter     .

   Clear Channel worships Our Great Fuehrer....er....Leader     Harry Hope   Mon, 06 Dec 2004 23:35:23 GMT   Clear Channel worships Our Great Fuehrer....er....Leader   One of the hallmarks of a good totalitarian leader is the tendency to jump into a military uniform at the drop of a hat (although stuffing socks in your crotch while doing it is an innovation apparently dreamed up by George W. Bush).  Another is to make sure there are plenty of very big pictures of yourself all over the place.  Fortunately for Our Great Leader he doesn't have to do this himself, because he's got one of the biggest media companies in the country to do it for him.  Clear Channel - home to Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity - owns over 1,200 radio stations and 57 television stations in America.  They also own a lot of billboards.  Want to know what they do with their billboards when nobody's paying to use them?  The picture was taken off I-4 north of downtown Orlando by DUer davhill.  The text at the bottom reads, "Not authorized by any candidate or candidate's committee. A political public service message brought to you by Clear Channel."  Did you know that one of the largest media companies in the country was in the business of bringing you "political public service messages?"  Me either.  Truth be told we originally thought that this picture was fake, but we had to eat crow when Clear Channel released a statement which read in part, "Clear Channel Outdoor markets are operated locally.  Local managers determine what copy to use when a location has time that is not sold to an advertiser."  That statement was made after Clear Channel denied the billboard existed, of course.  Florida's not the only state to suffer Clear Channel's "political public service messages" by the way - check out this one from Arizona:  Curse you, liberal media!

   Bush administration quietly stops destroying chemical and biological weapons     J   Mon, 24 Jan 2005 05:40:37 -0600   Bush administration quietly stops destroying chemical and biological weapons   Unnoticed by anyone else, the Bush administration has quietly ditched programs to destroy America's biggest-in-the-world stockpile of chemical and biological weapons.  Eight places in the US are used to stockpile chemical weapons -- including blister agents, riot agents, and the dreaded nerve agents. In these eight locations, hundreds of thousands of artillery rounds, bombs, and rockets are stacked in both open and bunker storage, some of them leaking their contents and all of the very deadly. Storage locations include: -- Anniston Army Depot, Anniston, AL -- Rocky Mountain Arsenal, Pueblo, CO -- Bluegrass Army Depot, Lexington, KY -- Aberdeen Proving Grounds, MD -- Toelle Army Depot, Toelle, UT (the granddaddy of them all)  Destruction is underway in Anniston where the Dept of Defense built and is operating an incinerator to burn weapons located there. Plans were underway to build destruction facilities at all other locations but now the Bush junta has removed from its proposed defense budget for fiscal year 2006 all but the minimum funding for these destruction projects. Plans to destroy chemical weapons are now stopped, except for a small test program at Toelle. Contractors (Bechtel was the main contractor) have been told to stop all design and construction work and the re-assign their people -- the destruction programs are dead.)  Can anyone spell "W. M. D."?  Can anyone tell me which nation in the world owns the most WMD? (Hint: It's neither Iraq, Iran, nor North Korea -- none of the famous "Axis of Evil.")  You don't suppose they have stopped destroying these weapons because they plan to use them?     .

   The old wedding problem     Lee Paulson   Mon, 3 Jan 2005 08:54:47 -0500   The old wedding problem   Two of my nephews were excluded from their brother's wedding this weekend because they are not LDS. Of interest, neither went to the reception either. Both were extremely hurt, particularly since they know their brother could have had a civil ceremony and then been married in the temple later. I was offended because one of those nephews and I are very close, and he was really upset.  The groom said "it wasn't quite what I had expected." The bride is not quite able to speak in front of strangers, so I don't know what she thought. She did tell my niece that she thought her husband was a good catch--RM attending BYU and all that.  I got a sort of an icky feeling when I realized the only people who did attend the kid's wedding was his unmedicated bi-polar mother and his father, who suffers from Alzheimers.  -- Regards, Lee, the James, uM, feminist  The religion that is afraid of science dishonors God and commits suicide. Ralph Waldo Emerson     Peggy Tatyana   Mon, 3 Jan 2005 10:17:10 -0700   Re: The old wedding problem          That's sad, Lee. I really think it's time for the church to admit that a civil ceremony followed by a temple sealing reaches the same goal, often in a more loving way, than insisting that only the sealing is worth doing. A change of that sort would be very simple to implement, and most church members would like it better than allowing non-LDS family members into the temple, which would actually be my preference.  There's been a thread recently in one of the exMo fora about a woman whose bishop, who she had been planning to have marry her, was going out of town, so she asked the stake president, who she didn't know well. He insisted that he needed to make the point, as part of performing the ceremony, that she really needed to be married in the temple, even though her fiance was not LDS. She ultimately declined his services.  How to get the message across to young people that considering the feelings of their family is just as important as being sealed for time and all eternity? I don't know. It would have to be some sort of grassroots movement, I think, since it's not likely to come through official, correlated channels.

From a family standpoint it sounded liek a good decision, harmony and all that...plus the temple ceremony could be sealed a year later. Unfortunately we started off on the wrong foot for a lot of reasons and the marriage didn't last. I can't help but wonder if perhaps we did ourselves a diservice by not getting sealedi ntially, and making our marriage a gospel focused one. Who's to say. It's a tough decision to make and despite the feeling I myself caved I feel people should be understanding of the rationale. For my part if we had been sealed intially there simply wouldn't have been ANYONE there and both our families had harsh feeligns about the church as is, and a sealign would have only created more disharmony. For my part though, I think we started the marriage with a compromise and deined ourselves tremendous blessing and ultimately paid the price.           Peggy Tatyana   Mon, 3 Jan 2005 11:34:00 -0700   Re: The old wedding problem         Hmm... I wonder how many success stories are out there from people who chose to have a civil ceremony, and went on later to be happily sealed. I know that was what happened with my own parents, largely because their decision to get married and my father's decision to join the church came very close together, and they didn't want to wait the year until he would be able to enter the temple. They're still together after more than 55 years.           .

   divorce is really stupid ...     dogbirdh...@yahoo.com   13 Jan 2005 09:51:33 -0800   divorce is really stupid ...   I think divorce is really stupid. It'll take me awhile to get to thought stream that got me to that thought today.  First off, I'm remarried, divorced 3 years ago. I love my wife, and the kids get along just fine. I don't like my exwife. But there was a numerous flaws, chief among those flaws is that she's a narcicists. But we all have some sort of personality problems ....  My wife belongs to a support group, and just for fun, they all googled their hubbies ex's.  Somehow, this lead me to googling my ex's boyfriend, call him B. And there he was, talking about plans with his wife and kids. Wow. To me, B was just this one dimensional guy that was being dragged along by my exwife. Now, he turns out to have a 3 dimensional life too. I guess we all do. I'd like to take him out for a beer sometime. It would be fun.  I wonder what happenned to B's son? My kids never mentioned B having a son. B's son is apparently 16 years old, same age as my daughter. I wonder if B had a huge messy divorce, and his ex took the kid out of state. My ex threatened that. Ouch. Divorce really sucks. I have my kids almost 50/50 these days, but it was a huge messy post divorce compromise that took a year to complete. I wonder if B had to go through some of the same kind of shit? Perhaps my exwife has more sympathy for what its like to be a guy on the receiving end of a divorce now?  Ok, keep googling. Oh my, the plot thickens. I found B's exwife. Very articulate writer. This is really humorous. She wrote an article about a divorce support group, ending it with something about Mrs. B being happily married but she's impressed by the divorce support group. And that was only 4 years ago! Mr. and Mrs. B had a real life too. They shared dreams together, raised a kid, and probably had a lot of fun together. Now I'm even more curious about the B's kid. She still lives in town here. Maybe there was some sort of terrible tragedy??? I'll have to ask about B's kid when my own kids switch off next week.  Sometimes we want to see marriage one dimensionally. Either its bad or good. That's total bullshit. I know my first marriage had a lot of good adventures, a lot of friendship, a lot of love. Oh, yeah, it wasn't perfect. My exwife is a total pain in the ass much of the time, and I tried to let her do what she wanted, sometimes I couldn't. But, even to the end, we loved each other. And now, I see the lost family ties. She's lost my family, I'm slowly drifting out of touch with her family. We both build new lives.  New lives. But you know, as long as the kids are shared, you can't total get this exspouse out of your mental psyche. They say it takes one year for every two that you were married. I believe that.  Meanwhile, life goes on. My wife's name is M. We're going to a bed and breakfast this weekend, to get away, relax. M and I are slowly building a history of our own together. We share adventures together, we share adventure with my kids, and with our dogs. And, I take lots of pictures. I really haven't changed very much from who I was before. Although, the dog thing is really post divorce. Lots and lots of pictures. Sometimes I look at the old photos, before divorce. We smiled together, laughed, hugged. I was one of the first digital camera users, and I have too many photos from my first marriage. Sometimes I feel like I'm racing to create enough photos of my new life to outweigh the long history of my first life. That's going to take awhile... Luckily, we flawed human beings live long lives, and digital cameras take lots and lots of pictures!  If my exwife doesn't dump B, maybe they'll wind up staying together, maybe even getting married. I think that would be nice. And they too will begin the process of rebuilding their "together" lives. I'm assuming there is some humanity beneath my exwife's narcicistic shell, but I do believe there is. B seems like a decent enough person too. So, B and my ex will be doing the same thing that I'm doing. Rebuilding their lives.  Anyway, all of this gets me back to my original point. Divorce seems really really stupid. It seems to me, that beneath it all, we all want the same things. Love, companionship, and a partner for our life's journies.  None of this makes total sense to me. But I just thought I'd ramble. - Hiking     Barbara Sz.   13 Jan 2005 10:49:39 -0800   Re: divorce is really stupid ...   Your post made me horribly sad.  My ex has that nice new life with the child-bride and the 2 cats and 2 dogs and new house and my son primarily lives with them even though he ends up being at my place 1/2 the time in a 2-week period. -- I live in a 961 sq. ft. apartment.  My ex has most all of the photos as our son lives there and it's his history. I did get a good bunch of the wedding photos, but my ex refused to give them all to me saying it was "his life too" even though I really resent them being under the same roof with his child-bride.  I'm sure they are taking lots of pictures of their trips/vacations/whatever (at least 2 that I know of). I don't own a camera.  His new inlaws are all former family friends I don't have anything to do with anymore for obvious reasons. His family (brother, sister, stepmother) conveniently seem to forget that for almost 20 years I was a member of their family. There was no gradual "drifting of out touch" despite the fact that we all live in the same city and my ex BIL and I even work within blocks of each other. My family thinks my ex is pond scum but because my parents are still members at the same church, they have to see my ex and his new wife every week. My mother took his remarriage harder than I did, I think, because of that.  Divorce *is* really stupid. Duh-uh. Especially for those of us who still have so many years (if one year for every 2 married, then I've still got another 7 or so) to go to get our heads screwed back on and find some sort of life that rivals what we had or what our ex has or what you and your ex have. So far, this is not it. -- Barbara Sz.     .

   Dell sued for "bait and switch" and false promises     Timothy Daniels   Sat, 26 Feb 2005 20:50:40 -0800   Dell sued for "bait and switch" and false promises   Dell is involved in a class action suit for "bait and switch", where a nurse claims Dell switched parts and charged her for the more expensive items, and for promising "easy credit" for which no one qualifies and then charges ridiculously high interest rates.  *TimDaniels*     RRR_News   Sun, 27 Feb 2005 12:14:24 -0500   Re: Dell sued for "bait and switch" and false promises   It seems someone did not read the credit terms, before purchasing item, "buyers' remorse". And lawyers trying to make a buck from it. Hope federal tort reform gets passed by the congress, so we can get rid of these charlatans.  Rich/rerat  (RRR News) (message rule) ((Previous Text Snipped to Save Bandwidth When Appropriate))           Christopher Muto   Sun, 27 Feb 2005 22:50:32 GMT   Re: Dell sued for "bait and switch" and false promises   i agree that the buyer probably didn't read the credit terms to find themselves with an unexpected rate... i always see that "for qualified customers" in all of their advertisements that probably releases them of any wrong doing... but i also believe in the court systems so let it take its course and see what happens. the only tort reform that i think should be done is to cap fees that lawyers are allowed to extract for class action suits. i feel that there is a valuable public service that comes from class actions suits which is to keep companies on the straight and narrow so that they avoid such actions... but from a monetary perspective the only real winners from class actions are the lawyers. i remember once receiving a fifty cent check in an envelope with postage of at least half that amount for the great 17" monitor class action suit.           Ben Myers   Mon, 28 Feb 2005 01:58:35 GMT   Re: Dell sued for "bait and switch" and false promises   Then there was the class action suit against Gateway brought by some Philadelphia lawyers a number of years ago. Gateway advertised and stickered many of its 486 computers as "Pentium Ready", meaning that a special Type 3 ZIF socket Pentium OverDrive could be installed and run.  Micronics designed the motherboards used by Gateway, and the basis of the design was a prototype Pentium OverDrive with an internal write-through cache, a more conservative cache design. Then Intel changed the Pentium OverDrive, and the final version had a write-BACK cache. When installed in a Gateway system, the chip ran slower than slow, maybe about as fast as an IBM AT, and bus-mastering devices like NICs and SCSI cards refused to work.  So the lawyers sued Gateway, and the settlement approved by the judge consisted of megabucks for the lawyers and coupons to owners of Gateway 486 computers.  The coupon was good for $50 off on the purchase of a Pentium OverDrive processor from Gateway, at its usual inflated prices !!! So, let's see. What does a discount coupon for a processor I can't use in my system do for me? I wonder how many people gleefully cashed in their coupons and bought Pentium OverDrives from Gateway.  Intel eventually compensated by making available an "interposer", a little socketed thingie installed between the Pentium OverDrive and the ZIF socket.  The sole purpose of the interposer was to raise a signal on the CPU to force its cache to operate in the write-thru mode which was compatible with most ZIF Socket 3 486 motherboards.  Needless to say, this was the least successful "OverDrive" CPU ever done by Intel. The 486-DX4 OverDrive was OK, as were several Socket 5 Pentium OverDrives and the Socket 8 Pentium Pro OverDrive. Finally Intel gave up on OverDrives... Ben Myers           Nascar12   Sun, 27 Feb 2005 22:45:13 -0500   Re: Dell sued for "bait and switch" and false promises   Believe it or not there are companies that go over the line and need to be hit with a stick called a law suit. It seems the fear of law suits is the only thing that keeps some of these crooked companies in line. The government sure doesn't have the resources or desire to pursue them so it's left to the private sector to protect themselves. Lawyers are bounty hunters of sorts. BTW, I hate lawyers but there are times that they are useful. Some are sleazebags but that can be said of most professions. There has to be at least a little threat of "let the company beware" to maintain a balance otherwise it'll be open season on consumers.           Jerry Park   Mon, 28 Feb 2005 13:12:59 -0600   Re: Dell sued for "bait and switch" and false promises         The only people who profit from class actions are the lawyers.  Since companies are going to be sued in class action, regardless of the merits of the case, the threat of a class action is not a detriment.  If you don't believe that, witness the Vioxx lawsuits. The company making Vioxx determined it might increase mortality and pulled it from the market. Because of that, it is being sued. The companies making similar drugs (Celebrex and Bextra) did not pull their product from the market. They are not being sued. Doing the right thing provides no protection from class action.  All class actions do is enrich lawyers and raise costs to everyone. The cost of class actions is factored into the cost of everything you buy.     .

   OT Best organization for donation     David Case   Sat, 8 Jan 2005 23:33:33 -0700   OT Best organization for donation   I would like to make a donation to help the survivors of the tsunami. I have a lot of skepticism with the Red Cross and a few others based on horror stories I have heard reported in the media. Because of this I have always shied away from these national organizations and stuck with local groups. Any thoughts as to where my money would go the furthest. Appreciate any input.     David Berman   Sun, 9 Jan 2005 01:06:03 -0800   Re: OT Best organization for donation         I've heard mostly positive things about how the Red Cross is handling their donations, with a very high percentage of the donated funds going directly for relief and not for administrative expenses. So that is the channel we chose for our own donation.  For what it's worth to you, here's some contact information for a few agencies that seem to be highly regarded. The Habitat for Humanity might be a good one to consider, since their expertise is in building housing, which of course is so beadly needed over there at this time:  American Red Cross: Disaster Relief Fund, P.O. Box 37243, Washington, DC 20013. Phone: (800) 435-7669  Habitat for Humanity International: Asia Tsunami Response Fund, 121 Habitat St., Americus, GA 31709-3498. Phone: (800) 422-4828  Save the Children: Attn: Asian Earthquake/Tsunami Relief Fund, 54 Wilton Road, Westport, CT 06880. Phone: (800) 728-3843  The Salvation Army: P.O. Box 269, Alexandria, VA 22313. (800) 725-2763.  --Best from David in NV     Sam D.   Sun, 9 Jan 2005 04:47:53 -0800   Re: OT Best organization for donation         Actually more of the money from your donation has a chance of going directly toward its intended purpose than any other charity. The Red Cross normally deducts 9% from all deductions for its administratice costs. It has announced that it will forego the 9% on donations earmarked for tsunami relief and that 100% of these funds will go directly toward aid.  9% in administrative costs would place the Red Cross among charity organizations making the the most efficient use of donated funds. The figure for most charities is 10-16%.  I don't know what negative stories about the Red Cross you have heard. But nothing is 100% and no organization of any kind is perfect. Just because of its size, which dwarfs most other charities, I would assume that the Red Cross may be responsible for proportionately more blunders than most other charitable organizations. ------------------------------ ------------  As tragic as the earthquake and tsunami in South Asia have been, it is truly uplifting to see how so many people have opened their hearts and so generously responded to the call for help toward disaster relief efforts. Money from private donations has been flowing into charitable relief organizations at an unprecedented rate, in some cases by millions of dollars per hour. "Tsunami aid" was the fourth most frequently used term used in internet searches last week. Although the need for help is still continuing, some individual charities have announced that they have already received as much in donations as they can put to use for this effort.  The following announcement was received from MSF  "Doctors Without Borders/Mdecins Sans Frontires (MSF) has received an extraordinary outpouring of support for the people of South Asia and we are extremely grateful. As you know, it is very important to MSF that we use your contribution as you intend it to be used. This is why we want to let you know that at this time, MSF estimates that we have received sufficient funds for our currently foreseen emergency response in South Asia."     Thomas W.   Sun, 09 Jan 2005 21:55:27 +0100   Re: OT Best organization for donation         I've read that too - unfortunate, because I've worked with them in Rwanda and was very impressed with the professionalism of their organization. They also stated that there are lots of places in the world where they continue to work which needs plenty of help too - quite an important reminder because other needy areas of the world are getting less donations now. So they didn't discourage donations to them per se, just not for this specific area. Of course I realize that most people will want to help where the need for it is the most immediate.  All in all, the statement has confirmed my view that Doctors without Borders ia a very professional operatoin.  Thomas W.     Don Strevel   Sun, 9 Jan 2005 14:48:56 -0700   Re: OT Best organization for donation   No org is perfect. Our news system thrives on finding a chinc in the armor of an organisation, a not perfect organisation. They need ratings and will do anything for it. IMHO, go with the Red Cross, or any other national organisation. Just give carefully. if you are going to give assistance then LOOK with suspicion at all they do it is better to keep your $$$.

No doubt been the law in Q since it was extended from being drunk in charge of a horse. It's also been rigorously policed for as long as I can remember.  Note also that had the drunken fool attempted to sleep it off out of the car he'd have been carted off to clink for a different offence. Had he been seen consuming alcohol in public he'd have been done for that as well.

This is getting beyond a joke, several times I have slept in my car after a night out, to drive home or be picked up the next day depending on alcahol consumption. FFS just because he sat is the drivers seat does not mean he took control of the car. What about if he put the keys in the ignition to turn to accessories to listen to the radio?

McGill says the Law says so.         I thought this law was fairly well known, as long as you don't have the keys on you are ok. Surely everyone has heard the trick of rolling the front wheel over the keys. Chances are sleeping it off in the car won't be terribly effective because you'll most likely be over 0.05 the next morning anyway.  Michael     John_H   Tue, 07 Dec 2004 09:19:35 +1000   Re: Pissed? Don't want to drive? Tough luck. You are. McGill says the Law says so.          In Q he's in charge of the car from the moment he attempts to put the key in the door lock. If he's asleep in the back seat with the keys in his possession then he's the person in charge of the car.  The offence is being drunk in charge of a vehicle -- as distinct from being drunk while operating a vehicle (which is a separate offence).  The way to avoid being charged is to give the keys to someone else to unlock the door and have them hang on to the keys until you're below .05. The standard ruse is to throw the keys under the car after you've unlocked the door (which you can later claim was unlocked by a person unknown).  In this case the offender escaped conviction first time around because it was accepted that he attempted to get rid of the keys, which supposedly landed in his lap. Judge McGill got it right as the law stands.  -- John H     Diesel Damo   6 Dec 2004 16:07:39 -0800   Re: Pissed? Don't want to drive? Tough luck. You are. McGill says the Law says so.          Just trying to understand here... given this quote: "       .  Does that mean if I'm at home alone getting pissed with the car keys on the coffee table and the car parked outside, that I'm "in a position to drive the vehicle if I choose to do so without first taking charge of it from some other person" and can therefore be charged? Sure, no reasonable cop would do that, but just strictly talking from the law side of things.  Or does the fact that I'm on private property change that? Or what if I were in a bar with the car outside, keys in my pocket, but I've decided I'll take the train home later?  It would be a pretty sad state of the laws if they could come in, ask for the owner of car rego "XXX-999" and breathalise me because I had the keys in my pocket.

If he had a pistol in his pocket, or a case of gelignite at his feet, I'd guess that half the people on this ng would be baying for his hide.... Where's the fundamental difference?        Same as if the pistol is in the safe and the gelly is locked in the shed. So long as you don't attempt to access either any charge isn't likely to stick.        I'm reminded of when I lived in another state and the local cop charged the town drunk in his driveway after following him home from the pub. The drunk was acquitted on the technicality that he wasn't on a public road when the cop arrested him. Wouldn't have happened under Qld law -- and shouldn't have happened anywhere else. So whose law is stupid?        Agreed, and not likely to happen in Q. You're deemed to be in charge of the vehicle from the moment you attempt to put the key in the door lock. Sounds fair enough to me -- especially since most Queenslanders are well aware of the law..  -- John H     .

   Please welcome a new staff member     Austin Grad Community   Sat, 12 Feb 2005 11:54:05 -0600   Please welcome a new staff member   The following is from Mike Black:  Friends:  Please take some time next week to welcome a new staff member for Landmark Education in Houston! Her name is Janine Beck, she is from Tucson, AZ, and she most recently has been the team leader for Landmark Education programs in Tucson (the title is Source Person). She will be the Registration Manager for the Houston Center, accountable for causing registrations into the Landmark Forum. I know this is a huge commitment for her, and I am excited about the difference she will make in my life, my family, and in the lives of the people in this part of the world.  A staff member is a graduate. One of us. They are one of us that choose to have their life be about empowering others to live life powerfully and live a life they love. When you say "my life is for that" then everything in you life becomes about that. If you are married, your marriage is about making a difference in the world. If you have hobbies, the hobbies are about making a difference in the world. This is not an easy thing to take on. The mountain is very steep and hard to climb. It is also incredibly rewarding and fulfilling and gives purpose and meaning to your life. The poet Rilke once said "the spirit wants only that there be flight, as to who actually accomplishes it, in that she only has a passing interest". Being a staff member is about being the one who accomplishes it.  Please take a few moments to drop her a note (I do not have an email address for her. It will have to be snail mail), give her a call at the center, or send her a fax and welcome her to our Center. Knowing the graduates here appreciate her will make a huge difference for her. The phone number for the Houston Center is 713-865-9600, toll free 800-745-1997. The Fax number is 713-626-3677.  Thank you for your stand and for your partnership.

   Biography of Jo-Ann Bellucci     JBELLU...@COMCAST.NET   Mon, 10 Jan 2005 02:57:20 -0800   Biography of Jo-Ann Bellucci   My biography changed completely 5 years ago when I contracted a very severe case of fibromyalga. Usually I say nothing about it although it has severly limited my life, no truthly changed it completely! This good old days, when life was a kick!  I now live in Watertown, MA, 12 miles from Boston's Logan airport, in a lovely two family house I bought as an investment with my boss, my 9 year old Yorkshire Terrier, Teddy! I just turned 50 years old this Christmas. When I had a j.o.b. I ran a software company for a few years and then started my own company, Pinnacle Business Enterprises and was under a 5 year exclusive contract with PriceWaterhouoseCoopers doing a lot of interesting things like Business Process Engineering, processes but mostly people and the effect new process would have on them. Showing them how to invite change into their lives because it freed them from the mundanne tasks and allowed them to use their great creativity instead of their backs. I'll get on to the more fun stuff (read embarrassing, teasable stuff)in a minute but just one business story.  Those of you in Louisianna are very familiar with what used to be The Akzo Salt Mines. On a client visit one day, unexpectedly, they dressed me up in safety equipment and ran me down the mine shaft. I mention this because I never really got over, after that, how much we take advantage of evryday things ...like the salt on our tables or the rock salt that keeps the northern cities moving in the winter! After I learned how to breath with my emergency apparatice I was driven around to see the manufacturing sites. I'm sure we are all familiar with those Yellow Tonka trucks little boys play with and move dirt from one place to another....well just imagine an ENTIRE UNDERGROUND CITY with a variety of those types of trucks (erath movers, backhoes etc) EXCEPT the tires alone are 8 foot tall! Its then that I realized that life is ever so much more then you can see on the surface in all aspects!  Ok Chris ... here comes the stuff you can pay me back with. I am an excellent dancer, started before I could walk. I've studied ballet, tap, toe, jazz and modern and studied opera singing for a while. Due to the medications necessitated by my illness, I have lost 150 lbs twice,and in between illnesses, I modelled for several of both trendy and elegant boutique and department stores as well as did runway work. One day I'll show you my portfolio.  I grew up in what at that time was rural NJ and my father was an avid hunter and sportsman. My father, way ahead of his time in his thinking, was an equal oportunty thinker... that is why I can and love to shoot skeet, was a champion archer as a child, learned to camp and hike and drive a speedboat, kayack of course canoe and when I recover Chris, I will join you white wather rafing because I have only done level three but what an unbelievable rush!!  I love to craft, I knit, crochet, make furniture, paint and garden. I consider myself and "ALL AMERICAN GIRL" when that wasn't a politically incorrect phrase to use. I am single, and I teach religious education to teenagers as a challenge and as service to God ... but mostly because they are some of the most interesting, difficult people you can teach ... but I love them and once you teach them, they are GOLD.  Both my houses, in NJ and Boston are always open to friends and those who would be friends. And now I'll stop because I can see Chris getting ready to give me the hook.  My contact info: Jo-Ann Bellucci jbellu...@comcast.net 888-616-3404 - follows me no matter where I am.     .

   organizations committee     Lauren Rouse   Fri, 11 Feb 2005 17:13:41 -0800 (PST)   organizations committee   Howdy,  Lauren Rouse here. I'm in charge of getting everyone excited about contacting organizations so Marcella can meet with them. Next week we want to have as many dates as possible set up for her as we can, so we are asking y'all to please talk to your organizations to see if they would be interested in having Marcella come and speak. In the near future we will be expanding this to include all the other organizations that we can contact, but we are just keeping things safe for now. If you are interested in helping out with contacting organizations then please let me know, cause I need all the help I can get. There are 6 sub committees under the organizations committee:  Greek (2)  Department of Multicultural services (Tasha should have this taken care of)  MSC (2, but I think Crystal is taking care of some of this but she still will need some help)  Student Activities (3)  Academics and colleges (2)  International (1)  I am going to need that number of people to help with contacting people in these areas, so please let me know asap.   So, as I said earlier please just stick to contacting your organizations this weekend and friends you may have in other organizations. I have attached the welcome packet info if they are interested and I have the cheat sheet to use as a guideline for when you talk to them (just in case you don't have them yet). Remember to stress that Marcella can either meet with the execs or the whole group (whatever works best), that she will be talking briefly, and that she will be there because she wants to learn about that group's concerns and issues at A&M. Don't say anything like "vote for Marcella" or "support Marcella" cause we don't want anyone to get in trouble.  If they are interested in setting up a meeting then have them contact me at 979-777-6445 or at laurouse...@yahoo.com and I will send the info to Tori, or have them contact Tori Foster to set up a time.  Also, let me know who you have already contacted and set up a meeting with so that I can make sure we don't call them twice.  Ok guys, sorry for the long e-mail and the rambling, but I want to make sure that I have everything covered. And if you have any questions feel free to contact me at the numbers, addresses above.  Thanks y'all! Have a great weekend!  Lauren  ------------------------------ --- Do you Yahoo!? Yahoo!

   Need Active Angel Investor for guaranteed capital deal     filmhedge   8 Feb 2005 09:06:49 -0800   Need Active Angel Investor for guaranteed capital deal   I am the head of a company that raised an angel round of financing from a San Francisco angel investor who I never physically met initially. Without sounding pretentious, he read my business plan and on the strength of it, wired me money a few weeks later  I am currently reviewing investor interest for a guaranteed motion picture capital fund (YES INVESTMENT IS 100% PROTECTED AND SECURED IN THE EVENT FILMS DO NOT PERFOM USING INNOVATIVE FIANCING HEDGE) for the following  I am looking for an active investor/partner for several films including a Russian "Goodfellas" meets "Once Upon A Time In America" and several high end studi-esque horror films where the principal of an investment is secured 100% exclusive of performance.  There is ripe window of opportunity right now for independently financed film examplified with the recent success of such films as Napolean Dynamite (made for 250,000, sold for 5 mil, made 50 million at b.o.), Garden State, Open Water, Maria Full of Grace, Motorcyle Diaries, SAW (made for 750,000-made 60 mil.) and others.  the CEOS and execs of companies such as Fred Smith of FEDEX, Norman Waitt Of Gateway, Jeff Skoll of Ebay, Roger Marino of EMC, Marc Turtletaub of The Money Store, Marc Cuban/Todd Wagner, and others have all parked their money in film ventures and deals similar to ours,  I need a similar self made entrepreneur who recently sold his company; is currently at the helm of one; or, a recently exited executive with a large severance pay who is sitting in the middle of nowhere, USA, is bored, and has always secretly wanted to get into the film business for tax, vanity, or alternative investment reasons.  While it seems there are other situations that are similar to mine, i feel that because I do offer a 100% capital guarantee of principal on investment, my business model and risk minimization offers more of a clear cut exit strategy than just a pie in the sky deal.  I am looking for someone who can help me get the financing and is no frills, reliable, and visionary when it will come down to it.  Someone who has an extensive network in alternative investments, hedge funds, private equity, and an old-school network. I am not looking for a boiler room cold caller, but someone that can present my deal to 5-10 guys and make it happen. email to filmhe...@aol.com     .

   The Pain of Childbirth     Anna Mc   Thu, 20 Jan 2005 10:04:19 +0100   The Pain of Childbirth   I have 2 girls already, nearly 8 and 4.5 yrs and I have always said I will NEVER forget the pain of childbirth. Abby was a true water birth (3kg - normal) and with Fiona I was dragged out of the pool after the head crowned (gyno had written on my notes she was 4kg (large) and that she was not to be born in the water (long painful story!) I can still remember though the pain I felt. I am on the large side but I am so worried about how I'm going to cope with a natural childbirth without a pool (not available round here). I've seen videos and heard of ladies who have "managed" their pain control. How in Heavens name can you do that? I've been there; I know what the pain feels like!!  Can anyone give me advice or let me know of any techniques which might be able to help? Thanks in advance.  Anna Mc     Dagny   Thu, 20 Jan 2005 06:08:30 -0500   Re: The Pain of Childbirth          If you don't have an institutional water birth available, have you considered just staying home? Unassisted or midwife attended?  I understand hypnobirthing can be very helpful. I am not pursuing it because I was able to go inside the pain to the good place without training, last time.  I have not been thinking much about the hard part of labor prior to getting so close. Now I remember how intense it is. I think I am still looking forward to it more than fearing it, but hey. It's a really intense, vulnerable thing.  -- Dagny     Welches   Thu, 20 Jan 2005 15:52:49 GMT   Re: The Pain of Childbirth         If you go for a home birth you can rent a birthing pool. I wouldn't necessaritly say that you will have a repeat labour! My first labour I was 30 hours and had an epidural after 22 hours. #2 I went in saying "give me the epidural asap-and never got to the state where I felt that I needed it. Only had tens and gas-and-air. So don't give up on the idea of a natural birth because last time was painful. I think different people/different labours are different, so just because one person says "I did *** and it didn't hurt a bit" doesn't mean that it will work for someone else, so going in with a set of suggestions, and being prepared to try them and see which is the best is probably the most helpful. (Oh and "it didn't hurt a bit" is usually helped by mummy amnesia!!;-P) Debbie     .

   waiver of extradition means what     JohnQ.Public   Thu, 02 Dec 2004 16:48:31 -0500   waiver of extradition means what   My girlfriend was on the run from probation in Fla when she got herself in trouble here in Az. which apparantly, true to her habits, she tried to avoid by not showing up for court. Time goes by, we meet etc etc she gets herself under the scrutiny of the police and into jail again.  fla trouble 1999 she signed a waiver of extradition as part of her plea deal  Az in trouble in 2001, fla is mentioned and she signs another waiver of extradition, posts bonds and skips (not far enough apparantly)  Az troubles again in 2004, she serves 6 months , then the day before she is to be released to do 5 yrs probation her in az, fla shows up and takes her to fla faceing her original 1999 charges which are still open (she failed miserably at probation) I think they want to give her 3 years.  my question isa this, what the heck is a waiver of extradition good 4 ? How will her probation be affected here? I ask around locally and no one will reply, not her public defender, the public defenders office, so I guess this is my last resource cuase I cannot afford to consult with an attorney. Thanks in advance, MLM the guy who shoulda known better.............     Eliyahu Rooff   Mon, 06 Dec 2004 10:02:57 -0500   Re: waiver of extradition means what         The waiver of extradition that she signed simply means that if she skips out and goes to another state, she can't contest the right of the original court to have her hauled back to its jurisdiction, and that the court won't have to initiate the time-consuming process of extraditing her. Instead, if the cops pick her up, she can be shipped back without delay.  Might be time to find a new girlfriend... this one seems to have a habit of ducking out when things get rough.  Eliyahu     Michael Jacobs   Mon, 06 Dec 2004 10:08:56 -0500   Re: waiver of extradition means what         She's going to have a lot of separate offenses to account for by this whatever the original charges were in both cases.        That means she has given up the right to force the FL authorities to go thru legal due process in demanding that the AZ authorities turn her over to them for further prosecution. All the FL prosecutors have to do is ask, and the AZ jailers will pack her up in a van or a plane and ship her back to FL for trial on the FTA charge and probably to commence her serving time under the suspended sentence that went along with her original probation. She's in DEEP SH__T if you haven't already figure that out.        Nowhere in USA would be far enough if she waived extradition.        Of course they do. That's what her waiver of extradition meant they could do. They let her serve her time in AZ, then they come and get her to serve her time in FL.        This is what happens when people blow off the chances they are given to straighten out by being given probation. Thumb your nose at the court often enough, and they will bring all sorts of crap down on your head, re-instituting the original suspended sentences and possibly adding on for the FTA.        What is it GOOD for? It's good for the STATE, not for the convict. It lets them skip some of the legal procedures she would otherwise be entitled to, in order to ship her from one state to another. But they were entitled to demand that waiver as a condition of probation; if she had not agreed to voluntarily waive that right, they probably would have just thrown her in jail for the 3 year sentence the first during probation and avoid jail altogether.        She doesn't have a lot of leeway here. She has done this numerous like they did the first 3 times. She will probably have to serve out her sentence in FL, AND if she has not already served all her time in AZ, they will then ship her back there to do THAT time.  Waitaminit, you said she DOES have a public defender? OK, he/she is doing all they can, but that's not much, under the circumstances. You're complaining that YOU can't get an atty? You don't need one. And her attys will not talk to you because you are not entitled to participate in their confidential communications with their client. But won't your GF tell you these things? If not, maybe it's because she doesn't want you to know either. Which you would then take into account in deciding if you still want her to be your significant other.

   Question regarding simple assault & battery     Annie Juhlyn Simon   Sat, 29 Jan 2005 22:25:56 -0500   Question regarding simple assault & battery   My roommate was hospitalized in mid-November for lung surgery and spent several days on loads of pain medication. On the fourth day of his stay, he was moved out of the ICU to the step-down unit, with a diagnosis of "ICU Psychosis secondary to narcotic administration" and post thoracostomy." He was confused, because of the medication but was not aggressive or threatening in any manner. I saw him each day and as soon as we spoke, he became oriented and was perfectly fine. This was witnessed by both the nursing staff and his doctors.  During the early evening hours of his sixth hospital day, he got up, dressed, pulled his chest tube out and managed to get out of the hospital and across four lanes of busy evening traffic, to our apartment. By the time he got to our home, he was very short of breath and there was a nurse and orderly who told me "he's crazy and just walked out." I sat him down on the couch and talked to him, and asked him what had happened. He said he'd asked for something for pain and they told hime he couldn't have anything. Then the orderly was apparently rude to him, and that's when he got up and decided to come home. A short time later, two police officers showed up and told me they had to take him back to the hospital. He went back with the officers, gave them no problems at all. I received a call from the shift supervisor who told me they'd replaced his chest tube, given him some pain medication and he was doing much better. I told her to pass on the other shifts that if he became confused or upset to call me, and I'd talk to him, and get him settled down.  At 2:15 the next morning, I received a call from the night shift supervisor who told me my friend had been "verbally abusive and aggressive" and would I come over and talk to him. So, I went over there, getting to his room right at 2:30. There were two cops there and I asked what had happened. My roommate was in bed, sound asleep, and had all of his clothes on. A nurse said, "He beat two of us up. The cops are here because we're pressing charges." I've lived with this man 9 years and never in that time have I ever seen him be aggressive, violent or abusive in anyway. I asked to speak to the two nurses whom he'd alledgedly hit and was told I couldn't do that.  An hour or so passed and the got my roommate out of bed, took his chest tube out and discharged him. He was sent to another hospital with a psych unit until his psychosis resolved. I was given copies of a citation for simple assault and battery, then went to the police station several days later to find out what other paperwork was available on this incident. I was given a copy of a different citation, but with the identical information from the one I'd gotten the night of the incident. The police report has the victim saying she was "choked to where she almost lost consciousness, struck in the face with a belt buckle and it had left large marks, and that he'd grabbed her breasts and left marks. According to the police report, this woman never reported to the ER for verification of the injuries and no one else can verify exactly what happened to provoke this incident. My roommate has no recollection of the time from the day before the incident happened until he woke up at the other hospital.  He was cited for simple assault and battery. If there is no evidence, and that includes the belt buckle, how can the county prosecute this case.? All of his belongings were returned to me upon his discharge, with the exception of the belt buckle. The police do not have it and the hospital doesn't know what happened to it. Also, I was looking at both citations, I didn't get to the hospital until 2:30 am, and the officer has the time of incident as being at 2:34 am. Does anyone besides me see a problem with any of this? What kind of recourse does my roommate have in all of this?  Thanks from Oklahoma     John A. Weeks III   Tue, 01 Feb 2005 18:16:16 -0500   Re: Question regarding simple assault & battery         You need an attorney right away. You are not going to be able to poke holes in this case with Internet advice. In addition, I's suggest raising the stakes. The hospital obviously knew that your friend was having head problems, and they improperly treated him by not sending him to a psych ward, which allowed the situation to get worse until the point where he assaulted someone. Sue them for malpractice, and make the number big enough to get some serious attention.  -john-  -- ============================== ============================== ========== John A.

If your roommate cannot afford one, contact your roommate's parents about paying for one, or ask about getting a court appointed lawyer. Tell the lawyer that you will help with the case (do administrative stuff, etc) in any way that would help him/her defend your roommate.     .

   S Corp Profit distribution and Bankrupcy.     superprimen...@gmail.com   17 Feb 2005 21:50:52 -0800   S Corp Profit distribution and Bankrupcy.   My uncle declared bankruptcy in 2003 and his case closed in June 2004. If I give him shares in my corporation in Feb 2004 of my S Corporation making him 30% shareholder, and I finally distributed profit this year, will the creditors attempt to that take money from him in 2005?     Thomas Healy   Fri, 18 Feb 2005 06:09:54 GMT   Re: S Corp Profit distribution and Bankrupcy.   On 2/17/05 10:50 PM, in article 1108705852.360452.268...@f14g2 000cwb.googlegroups.com,        Probably not. But if he was required to list the shares in bankruptcy filings, and didn't, the answer may be different. I think, though, that any transaction after the bankruptcy filing date is part of his new life. -- Tom Healy, CPA Boulder, CO Web:     Shyster1040   Fri, 18 Feb 2005 08:32:13 -0500   Re: S Corp Profit distribution and Bankrupcy.   Was the trustee informed of the transfer of the shares? Since you gave your uncle the shares prior to his discharge, the shares should have become assets available to the bankruptcy estate for the satisfaction of debts. If the share transfer was reported to the trustee and the trustee did nothing about them, then you may be ok; however, if you failed to inform the trustee, then your uncle may be liable for hiding assets, which would, at the minimum, invalidate his discharge. Even if the transfer doesn't invalidate the whole discharge, the distribution might be subject to forfeiture to pay creditors' claims if you failed to inform the trustee of the share transfer.  You need to speak to a bankruptcy attorney pronto; this is a bankruptcy matter, not a tax matter.     superprimen...@gmail.com   18 Feb 2005 10:49:15 -0800   Re: S Corp Profit distribution and Bankrupcy.   the bankrupcy filing took place in 2003, but it didnt clear until early 2004 and that was when i gave him the shares. He had no shares in 2003.     Shyster1040   Fri, 18 Feb 2005 14:21:23 -0500   Re: S Corp Profit distribution and Bankrupcy.   Yes, but according to the facts you first gave, he had not yet received the bankruptcy discharge when you gave him the shares. I believe you had said that you gave him the shares in February 2004 but that the discharge didn't come until June of 2004. That means that he received the shares while he was still in bankruptcy, which means that the shares were potentially assets that the trustee could use to pay off creditors.  A bankruptcy case doesn't close until you get the discharge order, and until then everything that the debtor receives is fair game for the trustee. If the trustee was informed of the shares and did nothing about it, you are more likely than not ok, but if the trustee wasn't informed of the fact directly, then you may be in trouble.  If, however, your uncle received the shares after he obtained an order of discharge from the bankruptcy court, then as a general matter the creditors cannot go after the shares, unless they can prove that there was collusion between you and your uncle to hide his assets from them (e.g., by putting his assets in the corporation's name and then waiting until after the bankruptcy to transfer the shares to him).     .

   BTK why is it so difficult to get him?     Jeanne Ketterer   Sat, 19 Feb 2005 16:26:44 GMT   BTK why is it so difficult to get him?   Watching Larry King last night about the BTK killer and something just seems off about the whole thing. I don't understand -- weren't prints taken, etc? they have witnesses and I feel they have a whole lot more stuff. What about prints, DNM taken off of current envelopes, etc., he sent? I ~know~ and realize how difficult it is to get these serial killers, but still. An author plugging his book on LK claims and with a good bit of blow that the investigation was/is as big as Kennedy's. Really? I don't know, still feel something's off.  Jeanne     joyleenseymour   19 Feb 2005 17:21:25 -0800   Re: BTK why is it so difficult to get him?   Okay, I give up. What's the BTK killer?  joy     Lauradog   Sat, 19 Feb 2005 19:58:32 -0600   Re: BTK why is it so difficult to get him?         A serial killer in Wichita, Kansas who killed at least 8 people in the '70s and '80s. BTK stands for bind, torture, and kill. He sent several letters to the police and the media during that time. And now he is communicating with them again, sending tokens from his victims. Or someone is playing a big hoax. I've wondered too, with all the forensic advances in the past 25 years why he hasn't been identified. Here's a link.  Sue D.     raylopez99   27 Feb 2005 12:54:03 -0800   Re: BTK why is it so difficult to get him?   You do well to wonder why the BTK killer was not captured until yesterday.  The informal speculation is that the Wichita police department was not up to the task.  Consider this:  -One of the BTK killer's victims lived on the same street as the killer  -The BTK killer once called up a police dispatcher and told her of the crime he just committed, and still they could not catch him  -the BTK killer was a known nitpicker and nuissance. This is actually a indicator in profiles of serial killers and mastermind terrorists.  -the BTK killer was only found out when his daughter recognized certain traits and turned in her DNA, which was a close match to the DNA on file for her father. Like in the case of the Unibomber, if it wasn't for the foresight and charity of a relative, the BTK killer would still be loose.  I was once reading how a criminal was being tracked in Washington, DC, and how he escaped a police dragnet several times, once by taking a taxi. Though there are very brave police, to a large extent the police have no incentive to capture a criminal, just to stay out of harm's way and to collect facts after the fact. The rich hire private security for a reason--public security is often inadequate.  RL           Joan in GB-W   Sun, 27 Feb 2005 15:18:24 -0600   Re: BTK why is it so difficult to get him?         What does BTK stand for? I read the article in the newspaper this morning and no where did it answer that question. (And it's probably so obvious I will slap the side of my head when I find out.)  Joan     Jr@Ease   Sun, 27 Feb 2005 17:06:26 -0500   Re: BTK why is it so difficult to get him?         I think it's Bind, Torture and Kill. Or something like that.  John P  ____________________________ Where am I going?

I believe Bind Torture Kill = BTK. My point about taking so long ... for thirty years people didn't feel safe. The LE has an obligation to keep safe. I bet the neighbors are going through hell.

   [TAN] Parole     Mark Erikson   8 Feb 2005 10:50:23 -0800   [TAN] Parole   This is just a point of interest, I am not going to jail, and most certainly not in America - and my interest lies in the American jail system.  I've browsed around the internet and can't find the information I'm after.  What's the deal with parole?  If you get out on parole, what happens then, and how long does it last? (and, specifically, who takes you home once you get out of jail, or do you just get turfed out and expected to check in with your parole officer the next day?).  And, again fairly specifically (and I realise this is state specific, but I'm kinda looking for a general answer here): if an eighteen year old gets caught selling marijuana to 12-14 year olds, and gets put away for, say, three years, is this the sort of deal where he's likely to get parole, or just do the time and leave again?  -Mark Erikson     Vinny R.   Tue, 08 Feb 2005 14:22:50 -0500   Re: [TAN] Parole          Getting out on parole is usually a reward for good behavior while serving time. So you're basically free, with the expectation that you will not leave the state (assuming you've been jailed by the state gov't) and you have to check in with your parole officer on a regular basis (I think they give you a schedule). I *believe* you are also expected to get a job, housing, etc. and report this also. In some cases you may be referred to a specific 'halfway' house for reintroduction into society, and provided with a simple job. As for how long it lasts, I would say that it lasts for the rest of your sentence, but I'm not sure about that. Also, you can call someone to come pick you up when you leave, or call a taxi I guess.        Not just state-specific, judge(jury)-specific and case-specific. For some reason, I can't recall if selling drugs to minors qualifies as a jury trial or what. But these decisions are entirely up to the judge/jury, and the decision is usually made in regard to the character of the defendant.        - Vinny R.     Kate Nepveu   Wed, 09 Feb 2005 01:11:36 GMT   Re: [TAN] Parole          This is all based on my experience in New York.  You have to provide a planned residence when you're considered for parole, usually a relative or program of some kind. It lasts as long as the rest of your sentence lasts. You can go back to prison for violating the conditions of your parole, for a period of time up until your sentence runs out. Parole is not a right and its granting is discretionary.  -- Kate Nepveu E-mail: knep...@steelypips.org Home: Book log:     Kate Nepveu   Thu, 10 Feb 2005 02:53:42 GMT   Re: [TAN] Parole          [...]        Indeed, New York's statute says, "Discretionary release on parole shall not be granted merely as a reward for good conduct or efficient performance of duties while confined but after considering if there is a reasonable probability that, if such inmate is released, he will live and remain at liberty without violating the law, and that his release is not incompatible with the welfare of society and will not so deprecate the seriousness of his crime as to undermine respect for law." N.Y. Executive Law 259-i(2)(c)(A).  (Instead, there are ways of getting your parole eligibility date moved up for good behavior, or of creating strong presumptions in favor of parole release.)  --       /     Rich   15 Feb 2005 22:29:04 -0800   Re: [TAN] Parole   One of the factors for the standard Kate mentioned is whether the inmate has rehabilitated himself. Rehabilitation is one of the major goals of prison.  --Rich     .

   OT: Republican election standards     gould0...@aol.com   30 Jan 2005 10:06:08 -0800   OT: Republican election standards   Here on the left edge of the country, we have a unique perspective on election standards.  In Iraq, an election takes place in which one of the three major forces vying for control of the country opts out. A few people will turn out and elect somebody. It is hailed as the greatest triumph of democracy since the defeat of Imperial Japan.  In Washington State, our governor's race may be undecided for months to come. Following the election and recount process exactly as outlined in our state constitution, the democratic candidate won by a margin of less than 200 votes. With roughly three million votes cast in the race, the margin of victory was a few ten thousands of one percent or some such microscopic amount. For all intents and purposes it was a tie- but somebody had to end up with a few more votes and this time around it was the demos.  The same group of people who have said "even if some regions are too unsafe for people to go to the polls and even if large portions of the population will not recognize the legitimacy of the outcome, some election is better than no election, and it's a great day for democracy!"...........are suing to overthrow the results of the governor's election is Washington State because there were some "errors" in the process. (They hollered "fraud" until they got to court, but unable to find any evidence with which to substantiate that charge they have backed down to "errors".)  So the standards are: Any old process halfway resembling an election is just diddly dandy in Iraq, but we won't accept the results of a free and fair election in Washington State because there may have been a human error rate of 0.0000001 percent. In Washington State, the election has to be not only free and fair, but also "perfect". (Of course, the Republicans would have thought the WA State election *was* perfect, had their candidate held the same 100 and some vote margin when all the smoke finally cleared). Funny how the standards change, and so easily, depending on agenda.     Bert Robbins   Sun, 30 Jan 2005 13:52:34 -0500   Re: Republican election standards         We have seen our state's standards. Keep recounting the votes until you get the results you want and if you need to go "find" some more votes in a warehouse, in a box, hidden behind some other boxes.        This is too funny. The ones that are "opting" out are in one of three protected classes within Iraq. The protected classes are Kurd's, Sunni's and Women.        only vote that ends in a tie is where both sides have the exact same number of votes. This didn't happen in Washington State. It took multiple recounts before the vote tabulation was determined to be credible by the Democrats.        Wasn't it King County that had "counted" more votes than registered voters. Please explain how this happens. It seems that the evidence of irregularity in the voting process is extremely apparent.        Yes, it is funny isn't it?     Snafu   Sun, 30 Jan 2005 15:26:13 -0800   Re: OT: Republican election standards          I'm a Democrat, a liberal and probably whole bunch of other labels that you can pin on me. I'm always glad to see people gain the opportunity to change their government from a dictatorship to a democracy. Everyone, everywhere should have the basic right to elect their government.  The problem with this election is that no matter what happens the results are going to be tainted and questionable. Think about this objectively (forget the US is involved), if a foreign country invaded another and set up elections, wouldn't a reasonable person question the validity of the election results? Let's assign some names. Say it's 1942, and the German occupiers in Holland have set up elections with Dutch candidates. Well, not really candidates, but political parties -- you'll be told who the candidates were later. Would you say the results are valid?  Even if you, John H, believe the US held impartial elections in Iraq, don't you think the rest of the world will find the results invalid, or least suspect?     JohnH   Sun, 30 Jan 2005 20:10:39 -0500   Re: OT: Republican election standards   On Sun, 30 Jan 2005 15:26:13 -0800, "Snafu"        If Lou Dobbs, on CNN, at 6:10 Eastern, can say, "This election was a success by any measure," that's good enough for me.  Not even Chris (Kerry's my man) Mathews could find any real fault with the outcome. Our soldiers weren'e even close to the polls. Hell, they couldn't even see the polls in most places, so the intimidation bullshit is just that. Even Brian Williams, when questioned by Chris, had to admit that he saw nothing to show US intimidation. (You could tell it was killing Brian to have to admit that!)  Of course,you probably know better since you were there, right?  Here, go read something from people who are there:  If you look closely, you'll even find some negatives to gloat over.           Bert Robbins   Sun, 30 Jan 2005 20:26:26 -0500   Re: OT: Republican election standards         You have to start somewhere and this election is to get a legislative body to write a constitution for Iraq. The next election will be the one with more legitimacy. Sounds like how our country started doesn't it?     JohnH   Mon, 31 Jan 2005 08:38:01 -0500   Re: OT: Republican election standards   On Sun, 30 Jan 2005 21:38:22 -        Sorry about my hard ass attitude!  The US soldiers were purposely kept well away from the polls during the time the polls were open. They were the outer of three concentric security rings, with the Iraqi police and Army occupying the closest two rings.  I watched a lot (but not all, of course) of the news on most of the different channels, staying up until 5 am (like a real dummy!). I didn't see one instance of US soldiers at polling places. I *did* see a lot of Iraqi soldiers. Except for the US flag on the shoulder and the different weapons, they look pretty much the same. Hell, I noticed that some of the US soldiers were carrying AK's in one place!  John H  On the 'PocoLoco' out of Deale, MD, on the beautiful Chesapeake Bay!

   Turns out the August 2003 crisis was not a crisis     Sam Sloan   Thu, 16 Dec 2004 15:47:26 GMT   Turns out the August 2003 crisis was not a crisis   Turns out the August 2003 crisis was not a crisis  Everyone has heard the story: Beatriz Marinello was elected USCF President on August 11, 2003 in Los Angeles. Immediately after she took office, she found out that the USCF had no money in the bank, zero. The USCF did not even have the money to pay the guaranteed prizes at the just concluded US Open in Los Angeles.  Therefore, on August 20, 2003, bravely Beatriz walked into the USCF Offices in New Windsor and immediately fired 17 staff members. John McCrary resigned from the board as a result.  Of course, it was just a pure coincidence that the 17 people Beatriz fired were the people she had grown to dislike during the year that she worked for the USCF in 1999-2000.  It took six weeks before the USCF paid the guaranteed prizes the prize winners had won at the US Open.  I have just found out something that insiders had known for a long another bank account that nobody knew about. This was not due to any malfeasance. The office accountant for the USCF had set up a separate bank account and had put the entry fees from the US Open into that account. Nobody knew about that separate bank account, except for the accountant herself.  When this was discovered, the accountant explained that she was planning to keep the money in that account until the tournament was closed out. Perhaps the accountant was following a procedure followed by the USCF for scholastic tournaments. At scholastic tournaments, no cash prizes are paid. However, in adult tournaments, the players expect to receive their prizes, and to receive them immediately.  For this act of stupidity which had caused a grave crisis in the USCF, the accountant was immediately fired.  Had the existence of this $85,000 in a secret bank account been known, it would not have been necessary to fire those 17 people right away. Perhaps in the long run it was a good thing to fire them, but it might not have been a good idea to fire them all abruptly, in the same day.  Sam Sloan     StanB   Thu, 16 Dec 2004 20:14:34 -0500   Re: Turns out the August 2003 crisis was not a crisis         Bullcrap. He was embarassed by how Niro misled him into thinking there would be a surplus. He was asked to wait until after the LA meeting was over before resigning.        Right, we shoulda pissed another 85,000 away before we stopped the red ink.     Parrthenon   17 Dec 2004 02:29:13 GMT   Re: Turns out the August 2003 crisis was not a crisis   Frank Niro thanks Sam Sloan in this message to the FIDE newsgroup:   Thu, 16 Dec 2004 21:06:29 EST   Frank Niro comments on the Aug 2003 so-called crisis   Yes, Sam, you are correct. And I knew about it also.  I also knew about the $100,000+ of audit adjustments (and non-adjustments) for inventory, unbilled advertising, newsstand sales, tournament revenues, pension &health insurance over-accruals, multi year membership revenue, etc. etc. that I was too sick to argue with Linda and the auditors about. I knew that they would get corrected as a matter of course during fiscal 2004 resulting in understatement of 2003 income and overstatement of 2004. And, of course, that is what happened. I just had no idea that the new Board would see it as leverage to seize power and pummel the office staff.  Not only was there adequate cash put aside, we had approval for an equity loan on the building to bridge the move. But I didn't want to pay the $10,000 points and interest unless and until it was absolutely necessary. We also had a buyer for the building at a prize much higher than it was eventually sold for and a commitment for 4% bank financing in Crossville.  Staff reductions were clearly in the works pending system changes that would be facilitated by any move, Miami, PBG, Crossville or elsewhere. To make the staff cuts without the system changes was absurd and probably the reason for McCrary &Camaratta's departures.  When I offered to attend the Board meeting in October 2003 to explain and clarify all this, I was told I was not welcome. I sat in New Windsor all weekend waiting for a phone call so I could answer EB questions and shed light on the situation. It is no coincidence that the employees let go included substantially all those who had offered to transfer to Crossville, including (remarkably) the employee of the year!  You can read all this in my book coming out next summer.  Thanks for seeing the truth for a change.  Best wishes to all, Frank Niro  In a message dated 12/16/2004 10:55:45 AM Eastern Standard Time,           .

   Bush has no shame (NPC)     BoMaGoSh Yndit   15 Dec 2004 12:54:29 -0800   Bush has no shame (NPC)   I really couldn't believe what I was watching while Bush put medals on Talent, Franks and Bremer. Talent was in charge of the CIA when two of the most costly intelligence failures in American history happened -- not recognizing the Sept. 11 plot, and wrongly claiming that Saddam had a stockpile of WMDs. Even people who mindlessly defend Bush's policies, like wjb67, don't want to take responsibility for Talent -- they point out that he was originally appointed by Clinton. Franks was in charge of the operation that was supposed to quickly go in, take over Iraq, and then start moving our troops out rapidly -- at this point I think we're going to see our troops over there at least through the end of the decade. And Bremer decided to destroy the existing Iraqi army, leaving it up to us and new recruits to try to impose order.  This is just one more of those wierd, through-the-looking-glass moments when Bush is trying to make something that at the very least has to be seen as troubling, and that I consider an unmitigated failure, into a success.     rpmoria...@aol.com   15 Dec 2004 13:01:46 -0800   Re: Bush has no shame (NPC)   Troubling indeed....I will say go a little easier on Franks-not that he deserves a medal- than the other two idiots though. He was not given very much to work with--Cheney and Rummy are the ones to blame for the screwed up war plans-of course I am sure they will get their medals too. Bush is one of those guys that just sees how he wants to see, and that is a terrible trait for a leader to have---rose-colored something something I beleive it's called. Now THIS is an argument against Bush I can throw my arms around!     JB   Wed, 15 Dec 2004 16:16:16 -0500   Re: Bush has no shame (NPC)   His name is Georege TENET.  If you're going to spread your hatred about someone, spell their name right.  Good thing Bush is easy to spell......           .

They are just trying to produce energy, as we have several nuclear power plants. And all the demands to Syria...this all seems so predictable. And if you were wondering, this is the link I got that from...

Moondog   Thu, 17 Feb 2005 19:52:32 -0600   Re: War with Iran         please. this is a cop-out response. the reason we are so worried is because we are on a higher level than 90% of the world because we have nucler weapons. if countries we don't like start developing nuclear weapons-grade material it makes us nervous. although so far, iran has shown that they are *not* producing weapons-grade material and are in fact using their nuclear power for just that, according to the IAEA. but when you have a sitting president who has an infatuation with provoking other countries into a war, you can bet that he will try everything he can to try to prove his case against iran.        maybe because oil is a much bigger polluting source of energy than nuclear? or maybe because it's more cost effective for them to use nuclear than any other method? why should they run their energy supply off of one of their backbone industries when oil is worth more to them on the open market?  -- "I am not allowed to ever come up with a single original thought.

   There is one Carousel organization again     Rapid T. Rabbit   17 Feb 2005 17:19:51 -0800   There is one Carousel organization again    I just received the latest issue of Merry-Go-Roundup, the quarterly publication of the National Carousel Association . In it was a blurb reporting that the American Carousel Society had recently disbanded.  Some of you may be wondering why there were two carousel organizations in the first place. The National Carousel Association was founded in the early 1970's by a group of art historians and collectors, including Frederick Fried, author of the 1964 book "A Pictorial History of The Carousel" that single-handedly gave the classic hand-carved wooden carousel the respect and appreciation it deserved. Other founders included Charlotte Dinger, who was already a major collector of carousel artwork at the time. The purpose of the NCA is "to promote conservation, appreciation, knowledge and enjoyment of the art of the classic wooden carousel and especially the preservation of complete wooden carousels."  The organization attracted a wide range of members, including carousel enthusiasts, owners/operators, theme and amusement parks, museums, libraries, those in the entertainment/recreation industry, art collectors and even auction houses, among others. It was the presence of these last two named groups that would eventually stir up controversy.  Thanks in large part to the NCA, the art of the carousel was receiving a lot of public attention and appreciation that it had not enjoyed before. However, this new and brighter spotlight on these antique rides also had the unfortunate effect of enhancing the collectibility and monetary value of operational carousels. They had become worth more money dead (i.e. in pieces) than alive (i.e. functioning). As such, during the 1980's many beautiful and unique wooden carousels would be broken up at the auction block, as owners rushed to cash in on the antique marketplace. The liability insurance crisis further aggravated the situation, as amusement park operators sought to cut their losses, while at the same time liquidate underperforming carousels to raise capital for the purchase of newer and more profitable (thrill) rides.  Some collectors of carousel art and auction houses were accused of using their NCA affiliation to gain information about vintage carousels that they could target for breakup to their own personal profit, a practice certainly contrary to the stated goals of the organization. The increasing rift between the "preservationists" and "collectors" would eventually boil over into an internal political struggle that caused many in the collectors faction of the NCA to walk out of the group, including founders such as Charlotte Dinger and others. The preservationists would chose to remain with the NCA, including Fred Fried.  At this time in the late 1970's, carousel artwork collector and printer Marge Swenson was the editor of the NCA's Merry-Go-Roundup publication. The political struggle that occurred within the NCA resulted in two slates of officers being presented for approval to the membership, something that was not supposed to happen. A thicker-than-usual issue of the Roundup would be filled with accusations from both factions in the group each accusing the other of improper behavior. Swenson herself would also leave the NCA. Not much later, she began publishing her own magazine called "Carousel Art", which was essentially a scholarly photo album depicting different carvers and styles each month. Meanwhile, those collectors who left the National Carousel Association banded together to form the American Carousel Society (ACS), whose stated aims of carousel preservation also recognized collectors as a positive asset towards that goal.  For the next couple of decades, the two carousel organizations would co-exist, each attracting its share of members. Some would actually join both groups, and even attend both of their annual conventions.  During the mid-1980's Walter Louck would begin publishing "The Carousel Trader", later renamed "The Carousel News & Trader". This monthly magazine would cover all angles and sides of the story of the carousel and be well received by all carousel enthusiasts. About a decade later, Carousel Art would suddenly cease publication. The NCA would continue to issue the Roundup to its members.  The mid to late 1990's saw the passing of NCA founder Fred Fried, and also that of Charlotte Dinger, both who represented the two opposite points of view in the carousel preservation debate.  Coincidentally and amazingly, the art of building hand-carved carousels (and even bandorgans) has been revived, with firms such as Carousel Works and Carousel Magic again building the popular rides in classic design. This development seems to have greatly alleviated the antique marketplace pressures that have doomed so many legacy wooden carousels over the past several decades.  The turn of the new millenium actually witnessesed a thaw in the relationship between the National Carousel Association and American Carousel Society, as newer and younger leadership took over from the founding generation. The two groups decided that the bickering between them was wasteful, conterproductive and pointless. There was talk of a (re)merger but the regulations governing non-profits prevented that. However, it was decided that NCA and ACS hold joint conventions to save on costs to both the clubs and the members.  Just within the past couple of months though, the American Carousel Society had determined that they did not have the funding to continue with the operation of their organization and officially ceased to exist.  So now, once again there is a single nationwide organization to join if you love carousels!  Rapid T. Rabbit     .

   Carnival Corp - Shareholder Discount on Princess     StephenM   Tue, 22 Feb 2005 08:13:13 GMT   Carnival Corp - Shareholder Discount on Princess   I'm taking a 7 day cruise with Princess in March and applied for my $100 Carnival Corp. Shareholder onboard credit.  Turns out that my travel Agent has a 'group' cruise on this ship and my $50/pp credit due to the 'group' cruise makes me ineligible for the shareholder credit. This really makes a mockery of the Shareholder credit as almost every cruise has some sort of small credit attached.  $100 won't break the bank or make the cruise less enjoyable, nor will I stop being a shareholder, but I do find this sort of thing irritating.  Stephen     George Leppla   Tue, 22 Feb 2005 08:04:07 -0500   Re: Carnival Corp - Shareholder Discount on Princess         This is incorrect. Have your TA get in touch with Rebecca Faroy at Carnival Corp's Investor's Relations department. It seems that some Princess people aren't fully aware of the correct policy. The Shareholder Credit does apply to group bookings.  -- George in PA  Miracle in May - The Mother of All Group Cruises 2 -     rieker5.nospam.e...@hotmail.com   Tue, 22 Feb 2005 10:10:27 -0500   Re: Carnival Corp - Shareholder Discount on Princess          George has it right. I have been on two group cruises and received my shareholder credit for both. (one Carnival Cruise, one HAL cruise)  Anyone have an idea if they will renew the shareholder credit arrangement? As it is now, it expires July 1, I think.     John & Beverly   Tue, 22 Feb 2005 10:23:19 -0600   Re: Carnival Corp - Shareholder Discount on Princess   Liza McDaniel in Yield Management denied us the shareholder discount last Thanksgiving because our TA had included us in a group.  John           rieker5.nospam.e...@hotmail.com   Tue, 22 Feb 2005 11:25:57 -0500   Re: Carnival Corp - Shareholder Discount on Princess FYI         One other item...did you contact Princess to submit your shareholder docs? The Carnival office in Florida only accepts docs for Carnival cruises....the other Carnival properties have to be contacted directly to submit shareholder docs. Ex: I sent my docs to HAL in Seattle for my HAL cruise, even though Carnival owns HAL.     Bob   Tue, 22 Feb 2005 08:33:03 -0800   Re: Carnival Corp - Shareholder Discount on Princess   You can get the larger of the shipboard credits. Until recently you could combine the stockholder credits with the credits for booking on board, but not with those from your agent.  The most recent Carnival report under Shareholder Benefit says, "not combinable with any other shipboard offer".  Therefore I recently sold my stock. (Made a nice profit.)

I cannot figure a place to put my $$ other than the cruise industry. Reports I read sound pretty rosey compared to other parts of the economy.     Tobie Gerbrandt   Tue, 22 Feb 2005 16:54:12 GMT   Re: Carnival Corp - Shareholder Discount on Princess   Don't give up. I believe that clause actually refers to promo cruises etc. and not to discounts, or shipboard credits offered by your TA.  I have doubled up on shareholder credits on both Carnival Corp. cruises and RCL cruises. Maybe you need a different travel agent.  Tobie on an Island in the Pacific            .

   Comments on suggested travel plans through New England     Ringo Langly   27 Jan 2005 22:21:56 -0800   Comments on suggested travel plans through New England   Hi all,  I live in Austin, Tx, and being one who's only been as far as Nashville, Tn two friends and I are planning a trip to New England for a week. I'd love some insight or suggestions on our trip itinerary --  First i went to Expedia and did some flight checks. We're planning on going July 4th week -- what better time to be in Boston I figure :)  Saturday, July 2nd - Fly from Austin, Tx to Boston and stay with friends living in Boston  Sunday, July 3rd - Hang around Boston and stay with friends  Monday, July 4th - Hang around Boston and stay with friends  Tuesday, July 5th - Leave early and drive to Niagara Falls, NY - 467 miles - Stay in Niagara Falls  Wednesday, July 6th - Leave from Niagara Falls and drive to Toronto, On - 85 miles - Drive back to Niagara Falls that evening - 85 miles - Stay in Niagara Falls  Thursday, July 7th - Leave Niagara Falls and drive to Red Bank, NY - 435 miles - Stay in Red Bank for the night - We want to hit-up Jay and Silent Bob's Silent Stash  Friday, July 8th - Drive back to Boston passing through New York -- do whatever -- 262 Miles from Red Banks to Boston but add whatever miles from New York - Stay the night with friends in Boston  Saturday, July 9th - Fly back to Austin  I figure staying in Red Bank, NJ, which isn't far from NYC, is cheaper then staying in the city. Plus while driving back north to Boston we can spend the day in NYC. I know there's WAY too much to do, but I have another friend who works at the MET I'll try to hook-up with. We'll plan our few hours in NYC wisely.  Also we're hanging in Boston for so many nights to visit with the friends there and hit the sights in that area. Also this is a vacation, so we hope to spend some time just chilling.  Any suggestions on changes? We have 3 people going, and Expedia shows the flight (round trip) and a rental car with unlimited miles being $1430, plus I'm figuring about $150 for gas and at $120 a night for hotel that's $360 total for that.  So total cost (without food, spending cash, parking, toll roads, etc) is $1910 or about $637 each. I'm figuring about $850 per person should be plenty for everything -- and that's not bad for 7 nights in New Enland with all the stuff we're planning.  Did I miss anything or does anyone see any suggestions or changes that might either save money or make our trip more worthwild?  Thanks again, and take care,  Ringo  Oh -- what kinda weather can we expect up there during July? Texas is in the 100's normally, so I hope the averages for July in New England are a fare bit cooler :)     B Vaughan   Fri, 28 Jan 2005 13:51:33 +0100   Re: Comments on suggested travel plans through New England          [snip]        Unless there's something in particular you want to see in Toronto, I don't see any reason to make this long side trip. I would suggest heading back to Red Bank or wherever and trying to carve out an extra day in New York City. You can find hotels in your price range, especially with three sharing a room.  You might want to drop off the car somewhere near Red Bank, or as soon as you arrive in New York, if the drop off charges aren't too much. Then you could spend part of one day in New York (and a good part of the next day, assuming you dropped Toronto). Then you could take the train or bus back to Boston. It might work out cheaper in the long run, especially when you consider the cost of parking in New York. -- Barbara Vaughan  My email address is my first initial followed by my last name at libero dot it.     Ringo Langly   28 Jan 2005 06:42:55 -0800   Re: Comments on suggested travel plans through New England          .  Hi Everyone,  Thanks for all the great replies!! This is exactly what I'm looking for :)  The main reason I'd like to goto Toronto and Niagara Falls is mainly because it's so close.. but I agree New York would be nice to spend a few days in.  I know the bulk of our trip is in Boston, but we have friends living up there we hope to spend a few days with visiting. The trip is both to visit with them and to spend time around New England.  As for gas, what is the going rate for gas right now in New England? Here in Texas it's around $1.60-$1.75 for Reg Unleadded, but i'm figuring $1.90 a gallon. Is this not accurate? Here's how I figured the price I'm factoring in -- Boston to Niagara Falls - 467 Miles Niagara Falls to Toronto - 85 Miles and 85 Miles back Niagara Falls to Red Bank, NJ - 435 Miles Red Bank, NJ to Boston (plus spending some time in NYC) - 262  Total is 1334, but I'm figuring 1500 with some extra for around NYC and various towns we visit. We're getting a mid-sized vehicle, so if the car gets 20 mpg that's 75 gallons used. This times $1.90 is $145.50 or around that. Even if gas is $2.00 a gallon that's still only around $150, so I think $200+ for gas is a rather high estimate.  Also is it possible to take a train from Boston to NYC? If so how does that work or what's the cost? I am from Texas where we drive everywhere, and I've never even set foot on a train -- so forgive me if this is a weird question :)  Thanks again for all the insight and help. Though I've never been up there I've always wanted to see both Niagara Falls and Toronto, so being so close I almost hate to miss an opportunity.  Take care,  Ringo     .

   Did you miss the inaugural address ?     Paul Mitchum   Sat, 22 Jan 2005 18:53:52 -0800   Re: Did you miss the inaugural address ?         The administration's approach to history is at odds with what has been described by a communications adviser to the president as the "reality-based community." A dumb phrase, but not a dumb thought: He meant that the administration sees history as dynamic and changeable, not static and impervious to redirection or improvement. That is the Bush administration way, and it happens to be realistic: History is dynamic and changeable. On the other hand, some things are constant, such as human imperfection, injustice, misery and bad government.  This world is not heaven.  The president's speech seemed rather heavenish. It was a God-drenched speech. This president, who has been accused of giving too much attention to religious imagery and religious thought, has not let the criticism enter him. God was invoked relentlessly. "The Author of Liberty.""God moves and chooses as He wills. We have confidence because freedom is the permanent hope of mankind . . . the longing of the soul."        Ending tyranny in the world? Well that's an ambition, and if you're going to have an ambition it might as well be a big one. But this declaration, which is not wrong by any means, seemed to me to land somewhere between dreamy and disturbing. Tyranny is a very bad thing and quite wicked, but one doesn't expect we're going to eradicate it any        This is--how else to put it?--over the top. It is the kind of sentence that makes you wonder if this White House did not, in the preparation period, have a case of what I have called in the past "mission inebriation." A sense that there are few legitimate boundaries to the desires born in the goodness of their good hearts.  One wonders if they shouldn't ease up, calm down, breathe deep, get more securely grounded. The most moving speeches summon us to the cause of what is actually possible. Perfection in the life of man on earth is not.  -- Peggy Noonan  "I hear the rumors on the internets." -- George W. Bush     Surfact   Sun, 23 Jan 2005 06:18:58 GMT   Re: Did you miss the inaugural address ?         god drenched? he's in good company.  read lincoln's rather short 2nd inaugural  it's about as "god drenched' as you could get. way more so than bush's (god, He, the Lord, etc.) over and over and over again. considering the brevity of the speech, you could barely fit any more "god's" and such in the address without buying vowels and consonants from vanna at a 5 fer 1 speshul price.  carry on, peggy  whit            Paul Mitchum   Sun, 23 Jan 2005 03:09:45 -0800   Re: Did you miss the inaugural address ?          To put it simply (for your benefit): Lincoln spoke *of* God, demonstrating the irony of a war fought between people with more similarities (their religious beliefs among them) than differences. Dubya spoke *for* God, demanding that we should all fall in line behind him, because he's got The Plan, and God's On His Side. Pure religious jingoism.  My favorite part of the speech, though, is this line:        You have to admire the sheer audacity of doublespeak like that. Especially when the list of the 'willing' just went into the circular file a few days ago.  Bush's inaugural is an announcement that the Bush Doctrine was as much a sales pitch as the WMD justification; BushCo hasn't abandoned the neocon ideal of a Pax Americana. And you, mr. whit, fell for it.  -- "I hear the rumors on the internets." -- George W. Bush     Surfact   Sun, 23 Jan 2005 14:42:01 GMT   Re: Did you miss the inaugural address ?          bull  and he has made the point repeatedly in interview after interview that he has never claimed to speak for god, nor has he claimed that this is "god's war"  it's a bunch of histrionic rubbish  and complete evasion from the fact tht lincoln's (wonderful) second inaugural was much more "god drenched" than bush's        no. i accept the fact that it's not a bad thing that bush mentioned god.  read the text of bush's 2nd inaugural  read lincoln's  they are both great speeches.  peggy noonan is full of it  whit     Charlie Wilkes   Mon, 24 Jan 2005 01:44:53 GMT   Re: Did you miss the inaugural address ?          I guess it's a matter of personal taste. Some people like Barry Manilow. It seems to me Bush is getting a bit pie-eyed and mystical. He's carrying out God's destiny to liberate mankind, and trusting in God to deliver a favorable outcome for a just cause. That is a fine sounding theory, but the results of Bush's policies look worse every day.  Charlie     .

   When is an election not an election?     ltlee1   3 Feb 2005 06:39:37 -0800   When is an election not an election?   Sunnis say Iraq poll illegitimate. Are there minimal requirements before an election can be considered an legitimate election?  The recent Iraq election was boycott by the Sunnis which constitute about 20% of the population. For example, in a city of 200,000 only 1400 had casted their votes. Many of the 1400 were civil workers and polices are Shiites from the south. In Fallujah, there were 5 voting stations with only ONE vote casted.  Are their boycott reasonable? If so, should that affect the legitimacy of the election?  ------------------  Sunnis say Iraq poll illegitimate A leading group of Iraqi Sunni clerics have said the country's landmark election lacks legitimacy as so many Sunnis did not take part in the vote. The clerics had encouraged Sunnis to boycott the elections because of the presence of US and foreign troops.  The US and Iraqi authorities, as well as the United Nations, have hailed the election as a "victory for democracy".  But the Association of Muslim Scholars says any government elected in the poll will not reflect the people's will.  "These elections lack legitimacy because a large segment of different sects, parties and currents with their influence in Iraq boycotted," the association said in a statement.  "This necessarily means the coming national assembly and government that will emerge from it will not possess the legitimacy to enable them to draft the coming constitution," it said.  The group said whilst it would respect the choice of Iraqis who had chosen to vote, it would regard the new government as having only limited powers.  [...]     PeterL   Thu, 3 Feb 2005 08:29:55 -0800   Re: When is an election not an election?   I guess ltlee is an expert on the legitimacy of an election, as the Chinese have so much experience running elections.          Guru Google   3 Feb 2005 08:33:28 -0800   Re: When is an election not an election?         No.. ltlee is pretty good to see others problem. But he don't see his own problem or problem near him (china). That sounds like our eyes when we are old, see things far but forget the nearby.  Remember the phoilosopher who observe the star in the sky and fall down by kicking a rock he don't see?     urillan   3 Feb 2005 09:46:15 -0800   Re: When is an election not an election?         Sunni say the poll is now illegitimate because they chose not to vote.  Fundamentally, choosing not to vote is actually a vote for the other side. If you choose not to vote, then you choose to give your opponents all the power.  If the Sunni's were prevented, or restricted or otherwise not allowed to vote, then they could claim illegitimacy, but since the simply just collectively decided not to vote, then they declared the vote legitimate of their own volition whilest simultaneously ceding power to all non-Sunnis.  If one slices off one's nose to spite their face, then nobody should be surprised about their complaints of bleeding.  This is another case of "well what did you bloody well expect to happen"?     ltlee1   3 Feb 2005 10:30:01 -0800   Re: When is an election not an election?         You are talking about physically restricted to vote at election day. However, it is not the Sunni clerics' complaints. Rather, their state reason is related to the reality that Iraq is currently under occupation.  Does the presence of foreign troops makes them less free? Were they consulted on setting the date of election and how to distribute seats from the votes gain? In addition, they are restricted from moving freely in their own country and/or their own city, would that not restricted their election related activities?        Well, I raised the question because the situation is novel. America invasion, occupation Iraqis are unprovoked.      urillan   3 Feb 2005 15:32:17 -0800   Re: When is an election not an election?         Their stated reason for not voting was because the country was under occupation. They faced, however, no pressure from the rest of the country, nor from the "occupying" forces to stay away from the vote.  The Sunni's now claim that the vote is not legitimate because they didn't vote. It's not their right to decide the legitimacy of the vote.  The Sunni's had ALL the power about a year ago. Then they, the minority, were toppled, and they used their power to intimidate and threaten Shi'ites through the entire period. Who do you think the insurgents were killing -- shi'ites.  If anyone has a right to call the elections "illegitimate" it would be the shi'ites.        They were invited to participate in each such decision. They are not restricted from moving within their own country. The Shi'ites had no problems turning out in large groups.        The situation is hardly novel. It happened in Japan from 1945 through 1947.     .

America has positioned its pieces on the chess board of global domination very carefully. Here are the options:  1. The US will use Hmong American sentiments against LPDR as the starting point for a regime change in Laos. However, Laos is not the goal; checkmate is the fall of China, and economic control of China. The US will support one or two Hmong individuals to speak out against LPDR human rights violation and Chao Fa resistance fighters. With a precedant set in Iraq for preemptive attacks, Laos will be taken overnight and become a source of invaluable logistics for U.S. military attacks on China.  2. The US's policy of handing out NTR will have the desired effect of reeling in alliances from the surrounding countries of China. Laos already has NTR. We shall wait and see if Chinese fat or American fat taste better to LPDR. If LPDR plays ball with Uncle Sam, then there will be no bloodshed in Laos. When the Americans get into Laos, the artificial cooperation will be sufficient for some strategic political changes. Some Hmong Americans may be reintroduced to Laos. Some Hmong in Laos, namely, Chao Fa, will be a good source of intelligence on Lao-China border activities. This will be Chao Fa's chance to replace their diet of tree roots with rice and fish. Again, America has LPDR under its control, and America can launch airstrikes and ground units from Laos.  3. Regardless of what happens, the U.S. has a direct ethnic connection to China by way of Hmong, which will secure CIA-insurgency operations. Unlike the current situation in the Middle-East, where the number of Arabic-speaking CIA agents are few, there will be plenty of Hmong/Chinese-speaking CIA agents for disposal and use in the looming Sino-US war. Perhaps by route of Thailand, if LPDR does not cooperate, the US will incite insurrection in the southern provinces of China. These provinces have a lot of Hmong people, and have been known to be the fiercest opposition to Chinese rule (aka Remember the Miao Rebellions?). This will be the Hmong's God-given chance to fight for their own country. Let's see if they (and we) agree to a coaltion government like the Kurds in Iraq.  Those are just 3 options. They all involve Hmong people. Read between the lines, the war will not be between the US and North Korea. China is using North Korea to escalate Sino-US relations and test Uncle Sam's temper.  I sure hope I am not sitting and watching when this all goes down. This is the perfect opportunity.  As Hmong people say, "Water runs strongly, engine sounds good."     Born2beHmong   10 Feb 2005 12:01:06 -0800   Re: NORTH KOREA SAYS IT HAS NUCLEAR WEAPONS   Zhen, i thought that you are an expert of fixing things...LOL! now, you are expert of preemptive strike...LOL!

   U.S. provoked Japan?     **bg**   Thu, 27 Jan 2005 17:03:23 +0000 (UTC)   U.S. provoked Japan?   I hear discussion along the lines that the United States was *wanting* to go to war with Japan, and had been trying to bring that about for years.  Any recognized books that develop this thesis; is there a definitive work?  -bg-  --     lesliemills2002@netscape. net   Fri, 28 Jan 2005 17:09:12 +0000 (UTC)   Re: U.S. provoked Japan?          I've read quite a few more rational works describing how the US was doing its best to avoid, or at the very least postpone, a war against Japan, mainly because FDR was trying to provoke Hitler to war and didn't need a distraction on another distant front.        work?  (stuff deleted)  The thesis has been expounded by several conspiracy theorists, mainly the ones who expounded that FDR knew Pearl Harbor was about to be attacked, and let it happen. One of their "proofs" was that the US carriers were out of port during the attack, and "everybody knew" carriers were the capital ship of the future.  However, the two carriers operating out of Pearl at the moment were sent West with light escort, on possibly intersecting routes with the IJN Kido Butai, which had far more carriers and a far heavier escort. Even stranger, the USS Enterprise was scheduled to be at Pearl by Dec 6th, but got delayed by a storm.  Consequently, for the PH conspiracy theorists to believe that FDR kept the carriers out of harm's way, we not only have to grant FDR the full knowledge of Kido Butai's route of approach would not result in either USN carrier fleet getting caught in a hopeless battle, but that FDR could psychically manipulate the weather to prevent Halsey from sailing into Pearl and thus be ambushed.  To make a very long story short, it is foolish to assume that the US wanted to go to war against Japan prior to 1941, considering the weight of evidence arguing against a US desire for war, and the overwhelming lack of evidence (not to mention rational thought) arguing for a US desire for war. --     mtfes...@netMAPSONscape.net   Fri, 28 Jan 2005 17:08:52 +0000 (UTC)   Re: U.S. provoked Japan?          Here's something I wrote as part of a larger article, some while ago:  Wasn't Japan just defending herself when she attacked the US?  This line of reasoning seems to derive from arguments that Japan was being "driven into a corner" by sanctions, and had no choice but to attack the US. Meiji Japan was driven to emulate what it thought the West was doing in every facet of society. They had observed, for example, that the West was able to carve up China into "Spheres of Influence", and was able to do from great distances, while they, the Japanese, had had limited success in their previous attempts to dominate the Korean peninsula, much less China. As part of the catch-up effort, she whole-heartedly entered into the Imperialist game in Asia, being treated as an equal (relative to her power) by the other powers. However, after World War I, Japan failed to recognize a fundamental shift in the attitudes of her former Imperial partners; they began a long, slow process of disengaging themselves from their former Imperial areas, from their colonies, in addition to outright stopping all expansions. Japan chose to read this as a sign that the West had lost its power and resolve, and that Japan was the rightful heir to Imperial mantle in Asia. With the deaths of many of the idealistic leaders who had led Japan's rise to international prominence, and the refusal of the US to intervene in Asian affairs, in addition to the Bolshevik revolution and the stripping of possessions from Germany, Britain found herself alone in dealing with an increasingly aggressive Japan in the area. Having a keen grasp of the obvious, she began a policy of acceding to Japanese hegemony in the area.  Japan continued a policy of acquiring territory for some grand, illusive scheme of a "Greater Asia", subordinate and grateful to Japan. The reality of this was that only a single possession, Manchuria, was profitable to the Japanese, and the rest of the Empire turned out to be a drain. This drain was greatly accelerated by Japan's invasion of China proper in 1936. It was a war that Japan assumed would be ended in "3 to 6 months"; at the time of Pearl Harbor, it had been going on for 5 years, at the cost of over half a million Japanese lives. The war put a tremendous strain on Japan (and was in fact opposed by more radically NATIONALISTIC elements, as taking away from the development of Japan's other possessions, particularly in the areas of scrap metal and fuel.) Domestic consumption fell, consumer goods became scarce, and the use of materiale for war purposes ate into Japan's domestic industry. This cut further into her foreign reserves, exacerbating the economic impact of the war. The war effort took on a life of its own, however, and common sense was subordinated to it. Japan expanded into areas of China and Indochina which had no strategic value to her, but put her in a position to threaten British and Dutch possessions in the area; possessions that both those Allied nations needed in order to continue their fight against Hitler. At this point, the US stopped ignoring the Japanese threat, and imposed a series of escalating sanctions on Japan, cutting off her scrap metal, limitting and then cutting off her oil (Japan imported most of both from the US.) While Japanese officials realized that they had enough of each resource for Japan to do well IF THE WAR IN CHINA STOPPED, they were powerless over the military they were supposed to control. An abortive attack on Soviet positions in Mongolia had placed Japan's focus firmly south, towards the possessions of the US' future allies. For no reason anyone could articulate, Japan felt she had to continue the war in China. To continue the war in China, she had to have resources of oil and metal. To have these resources, she must seize them, if others refused to sell them. In order to seize them, she felt she had to attack and destroy the naval power of the US.  Thus, for a "3 to 6 month" operation in China in 1937, Japan would embark on a war that would strip her of all the possessions and industries she had acquired in 70 years. she must seize them, if others refused to sell them. In order to seize them, she felt she had to attack and destroy the naval power of the US.

   The 1860 Presidential Election     Machiavegli   29 Jan 2005 22:04:38 GMT   The 1860 Presidential Election   In 1860 there was a four-way race between the Republican Party with Abraham Lincold, the Democratic Party with Stephen Douglas, the Southern Democratic Party with John Breckenridge, and the Constitutional Union Party with John Bell. Lincoln won a plurality with about 40% of the vote. WI it was only a two-way race between Lincoln and Douglas? I believe Douglas would have won. This would have delayed secession and the Civil War.     David Tenner   Sat, 29 Jan 2005 17:21:13 -0600   Re: The 1860 Presidential Election   machiave...@aol.com (Machiavegli) wrote in        "One feature of the result must not be omitted. Many careless observers felt at the time that the success of Lincoln was due entirely to the fact of there having been three opposing candidates in the field; or, in other words, to the dissensions in the Democratic party, which divided its vote between Breckinridge and Douglas. What merely moral strength the Democratic party would have gained had it remained united, it is impossible to estimate. Such a supposition can only be based on the absence of the extreme Southern doctrines concerning slavery. Given the presence of those doctrines in the canvass, no hypothesis can furnish a result different from that which occurred. In the contest upon the questions as they existed, the victory of Lincoln was certain. If all the votes given to all the opposing candidates had been concentrated and cast for a 'fusion ticket,' as was wholly or partly done in five States, the result would have been changed nowhere except in New Jersey, California, and Oregon; Lincoln would still have received but 11 fewer, or 169 electoral votes--majority of 35 in the entire electoral college." Abraham Lincoln, A History, Volume 2 by John George Nicolay and John Hay  See for a confirmation of the electoral arithmetic: the states where Lincoln got an abolute majority of the popular vote (i.e., all the free states except Oregon, California, and New Jersey) were sufficient to bring him a majority in the Electoral College. The reason that Lincoln could get an electoral majority with only forty percent of the popular vote was not that his opposition was divided but that he had far fewer "wasted" votes than his opponents--in ten southern states he got no popular votes at all.  It can of course be argued that the candidate of a united anti-Lincoln opposition might have done better than all the OTL anti-Lincoln candidates combined, because the mere fact of the divided nature of Lincoln's opposition might have discouraged anti-Lincoln men and led to fewer of them voting than would otherwise be the case. But given that turnout was quite high in 1860, I doubt this.  One thing seems reasonably clear to me: if there was to be a united anti- Lincoln opposition, Douglas could not lead it. He was hated too much in the South for his opposition to the admission of Kansas as a state under the pro-slavery Lecompton Constitution and for his interpretation of Dred Scott as still allowing territories to exclude slavery through unfriendly local legislation. (See  for Douglas's defense of his position.) He and Breckinridge and Bell would have to withdraw in favor of a compromise candidate--former governor Horatio Seymour of New York was one proposal. But I doubt that Seymour would have been able to do better than all the combined OTL anti-Lincoln candidates in such close states as Illinois and Indiana And his own state of New York was not really close enough for me to believe he could have taken that state from the Lincoln column.  -- David Tenner dten...@ameritech.net     Joseph T Major   Sun, 30 Jan 2005 11:13:09 -0500   Re: The 1860 Presidential Election          Whether it was Lincoln vs. Douglas or Lincoln vs. Fusion Candidate, wouldn't a candidate having won the Electoral College vote with only 40% of the popular vote have provoked protests anyhow?

Someone's BOUND to notice.  Hmmm ... now if the drone aircraft could lift a drone soldier and parachute ......  Oh well, I don't think there's really much we CAN do about Iranian nukes.

   Holocaust Day     Thomas Bauer   Thu, 27 Jan 2005 08:11:09 GMT   Holocaust Day   Yet again I notice that the media see gays as 'invisible' when it comes to Holocaust Day. This morning, when talking about the horrors of Auswitch on the BBC Breakfast programme, they referred to the slaughter of thousands of Jews and others. Surely gays and gypsies warrant more than to be referred to as 'others'. You wouldn't know anything about the slaughter of gays if you only listened to the BBC.     Lyn David Thomas   Thu, 27 Jan 2005 08:21:22 GMT   Re: Holocaust Day   On Thu, 27 Jan 2005 08:11:09 GMT        I have just (in the last 1/2 hour) heard Radio Wales refer to the millions of Jews and other minorites including Gypsies and homosexuals who died in the concentration camps.     Thomas Bauer   Thu, 27 Jan 2005 10:17:33 GMT   Re: Holocaust Day    Good Thomas Bauer           Peter Corlett   Thu, 27 Jan 2005 11:39:03 GMT   Re: Holocaust Day         The 'others' were named on Radio 4's Today.  Seems that those who listen to the BBC know, but those who watch it do not :p  -- This woman did not fly to extremes; she lived there. - Quentin Crisp     Peter Ould   Thu, 27 Jan 2005 13:11:44 GMT   Re: Holocaust Day   Hello Thomas,        As mentioned in "The Final Solution" thread, the number of men killed for being homosexual was at the most 10-15,000. Now that's significant, but compared to the genocide of Jews and Zigeuner it's not as significant (though of course to the family and loved ones of those who died every single one is significant).  Not trying to deny it happened, just trying to see some perspective. I for one said Kaddish this morning and will do so again at dusk.  Peter O     Vicky   Thu, 27 Jan 2005 21:06:15 GMT   Re: Holocaust Day   I was watching the BBC news this morning and they interviewed the man who is going to be in charge of Holocaust Day, certainly in the future. He very specifically mentioned gays, along with blacks and roma, and said that he was going to try and link future Days to the dangers of current prejudice and oppression.           John L   Fri, 28 Jan 2005 01:23:42 GMT   Re: Holocaust Day         This is a bit like rating Stalin and Hitler for badness purely on the grounds of the number of deaths they were responsible for.  It's "significant" if any group of people is identified for liquidation by the government of the country in which they live, surely? If there aren't as many identifiable individuals from a particular group in the general population, then by your significance = headcount yardstick some groups are never ever going to get rated as "significant".  In some ways, it is amazing that the Nazis were able to identify even *two* thousand homosexuals in the Thirties. By a bitter irony, without the burgeoning gay liberation movement in Germany (Magnus Hirschfeld et al) the issue may not even have arisen.  John L     Thomas Bauer   Fri, 28 Jan 2005 11:37:23 GMT   Re: Holocaust Day         That's good. I did get an email back from the BBC saying that they understood what I was saying and would try to be more inclusive. Thomas Bauer     Peter Ould   Fri, 28 Jan 2005 12:14:56 GMT   Re: Holocaust Day   Hello John,        I'm simply trying to get some perspective. The Holocaust of the Jews and Zigeuner was motivated by racial prejudices. The murder of (at the most) 10k homosexuals wasn't. Most homosexuals arrested during the Nazi era were imprisoned in normal jails. If you were homosexually oriented but did nothing with it the law in 30s Germany couldn't touch you. The Jews and Zigeuner on the other hand were killed simply for their ontological state.  Once again, I'm not diminishing the horror of any individual murder, just trying to get it into perspective.  Peter O     Robert Marshall   Fri, 28 Jan 2005 14:13:10 GMT   Re: Holocaust Day          Hang on a moment up there you say        it's shrunk, I think your agenda is showing! And that previous quote says        a rather important qualification. I think the chance of their being only 10000 who were homosexual amongst the how ever million were killed in the camps is rather small.  Records appear to show that 50000 _men_ were convicted of homosexuality during the Nazi rule, finding out how many were sent to a camp and killed there is more difficult especially as some who were sent to normal jails were transferred to camps at the end of their sentence, but 10-15k seems reasonable  Robert     .
