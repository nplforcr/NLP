    i just want to update you on kofi annan's remarks. the u.n. secretary-general did not answer questions on iraq as a result. there's nothing to report on that front. we have just gotten word from the ninth circuit court of appeals that that court has now put on hold its ruling banning the pledge of allegiance in public classrooms. schools in nine western states would have been prohibited from having students say the pledge starting monday. the stay was granted to give the school districts involved in the initial cases 90 days to appeal to the u.s. supreme court here in washington. the appeals court ruled last summer, but the phrase under god which was ad ded to the pledge in the 1950s is an unconstitutional endorsement of religion. we'll continue to follow this court ruling as well. here's how you're weighing in on our web question of the day. remember when we've been asking you this question. who is the number one threat facing the u.s.? is it saddam hussein, kim jong il or osama bin laden? look at the results. 13%% of you say saddam hussein. 14% of you who voted say kim jong il, 41% say osama bin laden. remember, this is not, not a 13, 46, 4 1, those are the numbers. you see them, 13% for saddam hussein, 46% for kim jong il, 41% for osama bin laden. remember this, ask not a scientific poll,     2003-03-04 18:00:35  .

    welcome back. 25 minutes after the hour. time for the cafferty file.   good morning. a crazy world we live in. the supreme court of the united states upheld the toughest three strikes law in the country yesterday. that's california's. they rejected challenges to the law of sentences of 25 years to life without parole for a man convicted of stealing some golf clubs and 50 years for a man who stole some videotapes. the idea is if you have three felony convictions, you're out of here. the voters overwhelmingly passed the law in 1994 to offset the liberal and lenient judges to let bad people off with nothing more than a slap of the wrist. they appealed to the supreme court on behalf of these two people. currently in california, 7000 people serving 25 to year life sentences under the three strikes law. one-third of them -- not that. 300 of them are in there for things like petty theft. 25 other states that have the three strikes law. and that brings us to the question. it was a close vote. 5-4 in the supreme court. here is the question of the day. you can e-mail us at am@cnn.com. it's designed to counter the kind of thing that i found in the new york newspaper this morning where a brooklyn woman who scalded her 4-year-old to death in a bathtub, walked out of court a free woman yesterday sentenced to five years probation. it took the child three weeks to die in the hot from -- hospital from the injuries it suffered at the hands of its mother and she's free. five years probation for killing her 4-year-old by scalding it to death in the bathtub. that is the     2003-03-06 07:30:40  .

    the morning papers, because morning papers around the country and around the world are remaking their front page to include the elizabeth smart case, and we end with that tonight. with her family on a day when their miracle finally came true.   she looks very, very healthy. she's grown a lot. and i'm just so absolutely thrilled. i couldn't believe it. in fact, i had to take a double take and pull her back away from me and say, "is it really you?" all of the children out there deserve to come home to their parents the way -- the way elizabeth has come back to us. and i just hope and pray that congress will quickly pass the amber alert so that those children will have a better chance because they cross the state line and they're out of commission. and we need to have this here. we really do. but i just am so grateful and so thankful. thank you very much.   reporter: can you describe elizabeth's demeanor? you said she looked good, she was bigger, but she's been through this horrible ordeal. is she still scared? she excited? happy?   i don't know. i mean, it was just -- i'm sure she was just thrilled to be back. i just -- such happiness and such love. and i just held her, held her the whole way home.   i just brought her little brother william in. and as william and she saw each other, it was such a wonderful reunion for them to just hug, and they -- he would hug her and look at her and hug her and look at her. and couldn't believe, i think, as a 4-year-old now that his sister is home.   with the darkness that surrounds us in these times of the possibility of war that could be coming upon us and a miracle that has been brought to us, an incredible miracle that has been brought to our family, words cannot express how grateful we are for the prayers around the world. do miracles still exist? and the answer is yes. and we have elizabeth back.   this neighborhood, the federal heights neighborhood, everybody's been ripped up, everybody's helped, everybody's prayed to do whatever they can. we thank god for all the searchers, for all the people. in the history of the world i don't think a little girl's been prayed for more than elizabeth smart. and we thank you for answering those prayers.   thank you.   it's a nice day to have this job. we'll see you tomorrow, 10:00 eastern time. -- captions by vitac -- www.vitac.com ...a ceo is about to announce employee of the year. earlier, several go-getters prepared to accept their award. ...and when i began this journey... ...when i started this journey... me? ...i had no idea i'd     2003-03-12 23:00:51  .

    we are watching activity in baghdad. while we do, we want to tell you marines battling for control of the bridges in the southern city of nasiriyah face stiff resistance from iraqi paramilitary groups today. for some perspective, let's turn to miles o'brien with retired air force general don shepperd.   thank you very much. if you are going to fight on the ground, you have to encounter bridges somewhere along the way. a lot of bridges between where the 3 7 cavalry and the rest of the u.s. forces are now and their ultimate destination, downtown baghdad. we have the city laid out for you here. how many bridges in this city alone?   in this map we have right here, 13 major bridges in downtown baghdad, including the expressway bridge over here. three bridges here attaching east baghdad to west baghdad and the palace area.   this is one technique, one possible way u.s. forces might seize a bridge, a bridge that might be defended by iraqis. let's look at the animation. typical scenario there. it doesn't really matter for this scenario that we're laying out here. this would be representing m1-a1 tanks coming towards the bridge firing.   you have to bundle up and line up to go across that bridge. makes it vulnerable to fire from the other side.   potentially chemical weapons, too.   as we turn the other direction, what you'll see are these iraqi tanks that are kind of fortified there. they have burns in front of them. artillery behind them firing back. and then they there goes the smoke screen. the idea of the smoke screen is to obscure the oncoming forces fire ing at you from being able to see.   it doesn't work, though.   it works both ways. it obscures you but also obscures them.   here's an f-16. he comes in and wants to identify his target and he's got a big --   can't see through the smoke. we've got some techniques we're going to show you.   somewhere near we can put down special     2003-03-25 15:31:13  .

    on we go in the meantime. again, today, there were disturbing hints, and we underscore hints here, that coalition forces may soon face an attack using chemical weapons. yesterday the story centered on intelligence regarding enemy intentions. today the evidence is somewhat more tangible. reporting for us, cnn's david ensor.   reporter: the evidence is accumulating that iraq may be planning to use chemical weapons. gas masks turning up in abandoned trenches. in nasiriyah in a building marked as a hospital u.s. marines found weapons, atropine antidote kits, and that was not all.   they found over 3,000 chemical suits and gas masks as well as a number of iraqi military uniforms.   reporter: the findings are heightening concerns among coalition forces approaching baghdad since, as the iraqis should know, u.s. and british forces do not use chemical weapons. u.s. officials say some intelligence indicates a red line may have been drawn around the capital with republican guard units ordered to use chemical weapons once u.s. and allied troops cross it. there is also intelligence, officials say, suggesting republican guard units have been issued artillery shells containing chemical agents.   there has been intelligence scraps, who knows how accurate they are, chatter in the system, that suggests that the closer that coalition forces get to baghdad and tikrit the greater the likelihood and that some command and control arrangements have been put in place.   reporter: in baghdad deputy prime minister tariq aziz repeated his government's stand -- it does not have any kind of weapons of mass destruction.   translator: when they started to talk about the weapons of mass destruction, we know and we always knew that that was fabrication and lines.   reporter: experts say saddam hussein's forces will likely try to hold out in baghdad for as long as possible without using the weapons his government insists it does not have, hoping to build international pressure on the u.s. and britain to back down.   in that sense any use of chemical weapons would be counterproductive to saddam, because it would only galvanize international     2003-03-25 22:31:09  .

    for some americans who find themselves spending hours on end watching television coverage of the war, it can be hard to break away. that is especially true if you have a loved one in the war zone. but as our candy crowley reminds us, life does and must go on.   reporter: spring-time and a game of catch on the washington mall. a gentle breeze and a good meal beside the pacific ocean. that other place, the one on tv all the time, might as well be on another planet. and that may be the point.   we happen to be at a very nice spot by the beach where this is a chance for people to get away from cnn coverage, everything, and kind of relax   reporter: time to redefine normal again, which on the homefront now seems to mean life as you live it only weirder.   i'm amazed at how unaffected i am by things, how i'm still coming to work and doing the same things and going for a walk in the morning. and it just seems so strange to me that it's almost a parallel universe.   more than 70 percent of americans say they are sad about the war. the barber at hinsville georgia larries that.   they seem more depressed. a lot of them afraid they're going to lose their jobs, you know, the economy is down and all kind of stuff.   life on the homefront seems the same at farmer's market in los angeles, but it's more angst ridden.   i don't think it's affecting our business as much as i was worried that it would, but you never know it's going to happen. if there's any kind of terrorism that happens here, i think that would definitely put a damper on everything.   nationwide, people shopped less in the first week of the war. sales fell 2 percent from the previous week. air travel has fallen 10 mers since the war began and some hotel chains say cancellations are up. 60 percent of the people say they're watching the war.   my boyfriend has been watching the tv like every single day, every time it comes on, he's watching it.   maybe fewer people are shoning because they're watching tv. maybe fewer are flying because they worry about terrorism or they worry about what the war will do to the economy or maybe it's everything.   there's no one economic statistics to point to a downturn, it's an overall feeling, a psychological feeling that everything is frozen, everything is on hold. consumers aren't spending, people aren't buying stock, everything is     2003-03-27 17:01:17  .

    we're getting late word tonight that geraldo rivera may not be be kicked out of iraq after all. originally the central command said the veteran fox news correspond was being expelled because he compromised the location of the unit he's been embedded with. now a spokesman from the central command is saying and i'm quoting "frankly, we have bigger and more important things to do." during a live broadcast geraldo drew a map in the sand showing the location of the unit in relation to baghdad. says he's not aware he's being expelled but says if so, it is because some bitter former colleagues of his at msnbc blew the whistle on him.   it sounds to me like some rats at my former network, nbc, are spreading some lies about me. you know, they can't compete fair and square on the battlefield so they're trying to stab me in the back. it is not first time.   the central command on the other hand says rivera is being kicked out of iraq because "he gave away the big picture stuff." all of this now under review, whether or not geraldo stays or goes. we'll continue to monitor that front on the store yix another veteran war correspondent is being fired for his controversial conduct in iraq. nbc is terminating freelancer reporter peter arnett for statements he made to the iraqi media. we showed you the statements yesterday. he said the coalition's first war plan had failed because of iraqi resistance. today he appeared on on nbc's "today" show and said he was sorry.   i want to apologize to the american people for clearly making a misjudgment over the weekend by giving an interview to iraqi television. now, i said in that interview essentially what we all know about the war, there have been delays in implementing policy, there has been surprises. but clearly by giving that interview to iraqi television, i created a firestorm in the united states. and for that i am truly sorry.   arnett had been covering the war for national geographic, which also fired him as tv reports were given exclusively to nbc and msnbc. late word from london that the tabloid the daily mirror just hired peter arnett to be its correspondent in baghdad. but the question remains did peter arnett and geraldo rivera cross the line? or were they within their rights as reporters? we posed that question to michael wolf, a contributing editor for "new york" magazine, a media columnist, an important article in the new issue of "new york." he's joining us now live from qatar. what do you say to the question, michael?   well, you know, i think i'm     2003-03-31 20:01:29  .

    bombardment of baghdad continues tonight and over the past 20 minutes, explosions rocking baghdad, central baghdad southern baghdad, the outskirts of baghdad, and importantly, as the coalition forces, principally u.s. army forces, move against saddam hussein international airport -- which is about ten miles outside the center of baghdad -- those explosions are intensifies. if we may again going to the wide screen of what appears to me to be abu dhabi television that is providing this picture, 3:20 a.m. in baghdad, live pictures again. that it is very difficult to discern whether or not that is, in point of fact, the missiles that we have become accustomed to striking baghdad and its environs, or whether it is the large 2,000 pound jdam bombs that have been striking targets sclected by the coalition in baghdad, or whether these flashes now represent artillery barrages as fighting continues to take control of the -- to take control of saddam international airport. again, correspondents, our correspondents with the -- embedded with these forces, with them in the field, saying in some cases they can see the lights of the skyline of baghdad. over the course of the past two weeks, since this war began, something like 23,000 coalition sorties have been flown, and over the course of the past 24 hours, 1,900 sorties flown. and we are told that, of those, 850 were strike sorties, motor vehicle most of those directed against the republican guard. as you know, the republican guard just outside baghdad to defend the city and saddam hussein's regime, in principal. two of those divisions absolutely devastated, destroyed. the so-called medina division, and the baghdad division. the baghdad division, of course, getting its name from the fact that it is the republican guard division designated to defend principally baghdad. four other divisions we are told have also been hit very, very very hard and are principally trying to reinforce units va also been hit very hard. so we are seeing a lot of what some of the military officials are calling a method that does not seem to be directed by one person from the center of baghdad. and that raises questions, questions that have been in front of us since that first strike on march 19th against the location that the cia military intelligence thought was a place where saddam hussein, perhaps his sons, were. that preemptive strike they put, i think somewhat elegantly, trying to strike at the head of the snake. new explosions rocking parts of baghdad tonight. we will continue to monitor that. we, of course, will bring the word to you just as soon as the army and coalition forces do take control of saddam hussein international airport, just on the outskirts of baghdad. in southern iraq today, british forces also moving closer to the center of the second largest city in iraq, basra. they captured an iraqi base in an unused factory in the southern suburbs of that city. tim hewart of itn reports.     2003-04-03 18:27:59  .

    looking at like pictures of heirs force one now on the ground at a royal air force base outside of belfast, northern ireland. it's called aldergrove, just outside belfast. the president of the united states coming for a brief two-day summit with the british prime minister tony blair. they'll be talking about a postwar iraq among other important subjects. they'll also have an opportunity to review the so-called road map for israeli/palestinian peace negotiations to get off the ground. they also want to review what the status is of northern ireland right now as that peace process seems to be taking hold. been relatively quiet in northern ireland over the past few years. this is the third time in as many weeks that president bush and prime minister blair will be sitting down to review station, war strategy, as they go forward together. go forward as close allies in trying to help put together a new iraq. there are some significant differences in their strategy, including what role precisely the united nations should have in determining the future of iraq. they'll try to thrash all of that out. you're look at the picture of air force one taxiing in on the tarmac, getting ready for the president. as we watched this picture of the air force one getting into this airport i want to bring in our military analyst general dan crisman to go over what happens happening in baghdad. seems pretty far away from belfast right now, general. but decisions that these two leaders make could have a significant impact on the future of iraq. first of all, general, we'll keep this picture up of air force one, talk about what you sense is happening on the streets of baghdad right now.   wolf, it's clearly the final phase. the engame which is unfoaling right now. i think it's very significant not only in baghdad but basra itself. you have coalition forces there in some strength. apparently three ba talians of the u.s. 3rd division in baghdad three coalition assets, three huge battle groups in basra itself which the u.k. has there, what they've developed here, wolf, over the last several weeks i very clear and increasingly clear intelligence as to what the final remnants of the regime leadership are in terms of where they are embedded in the cities. what they're doing is going in now, very carefully, obviously some symbolic raids against palaces. but the more important presence is to go after what intelligence delivers and that's where these key leaders are located. they're going to be defended fanatically but intelligence is so crucial from aerial platforms and special ops personnel to give the three assets the intel which they need to close with and eliminate final remnants of the regime in those citys. this is a very important final phase here, wolf, and it looks like the closure is coming here now more rapidly than we anticipated.   as we continue to watch air force one, now on the ground outside belfast, northern ireland, we'll be watching president bush emerge from the plane momentarily. we'll continue to have live coverage of that. when walter rodgers, our embedded reporter with the 3-7th cavalry says three battalions of troops are on the ground, inside baghdad itself, have taken up positions they're going to spend the night there presumably, how many soldiers are we talking about right now?   between 700 and 1,000. the task forces really, wolf are probably built around the m-2 bradley the basic infantry fighting vehicle. it is the equipment of choice for a task force like this to go into baghdad. it's cannon, it's ability to implace troops and fire through the firing ports in that bradley vehicle to take them in under protection. it's a very, very important piece of equipment. these are probably mechanized heavy task forces that have overhead aerial platforms to provide direct support. it's significant the degradation of the iraqi air defenses has allowed a-10s, predators, u-s, other assets to hover and loiter and provide the overhead protection to these task     2003-04-07 13:31:46  .

    welcome back n case you're just tuning in, our top story this hour, the discovery of suspect chemical weapons materials at an agricultural complex in central iraq. troops from the u.s. army's 101st airborne division went to the site on friday, finding a number of large drums buried in bunkers. initial tests were inconclusive. the general benjamin frankly of the 101st says today a more sophisticated test indicated the presence of nerve and blister agents. he says that type of test that is required sometimes shows false-positives and further testing will be done to determine whether the materials are indeed nonweaponized chemical agents or perhaps simply pesticides. general frankly says it is hard to believe u.n. inspectors would have found the facility hidden as deeply as it was near the euphrates river. we'll are much more on this developing story coming up in a few minutes. for the latest, though, on the air war, cnn's gary tuchman is joining us now live from an air base not far from iraq. what's happening there tonight, gary?   reporter: well, wolf, the air force is continuing its 24-hour air coverage over baghdad. there will always be multiple warplanes, fighter     2003-04-07 17:31:43  .

    a live picture of the president united states landing at an air field in northern ireland. once he gets out of the helicopter he'll transfer to air force one to come home after a 20-hour visit with the prime minister of great britain. they talked about a lot of things, about what peace in the middle east could look like, what post-war iraq could look like. they talked about problems in northern ireland. we're going to pause for a second to see if we see the president hopping off this chopper. as you probably know, the prime minister of the great britain has been under great pressure at home and much of europe to support giving the united nations a very strong role in stabilizing iraq. the white house had signaled consistently it wants the united states and great britain to create a lead role. we learned from john king, traveling with the president, that the new iraq run neither by u.s./british coalition or united nations, but by the iraqi people. that some of what the prime minister and president shared with reporters at news conference following their meetings. the president went on to say that an interim authority composed of iraq grs inside and outside the country will run iraq until a permanent government can be established. do you want to hang with the shot? okay, we're going to stay with this shot. we'll talk more about what the two leaders discussed at the joint news conference following their series of meetings. they really wanted to let folks who had any concerns about what the u.n. involvement might be to not worry. they said there will definitely be some kind of role for the united nations, they think it's very important for the european nations to be on board with the plan, but once again, they very much view the future of iraq as being that in iraqi hands. the president greeting a number of dignitaries as he gets ready here to board air force one on his way home. a little earlier this morning, i spoke with an iraqi dissident who teaches at writes extensively on the middle east. he wrote a book called the republic of fear. the politics of modern iraq. and i asked him about the news that saddam hussein was targeted in yesterday's strike and how iraqis would react if saddam was killed.     2003-04-08 09:55:01  .

    now that saddam hussein's regime has fallen is democracy the answer to iraq and its people. in his book, fareed zakar ericks a joins us now to talk about democracy and iraq's future. good to see you.   thank you, paula.   good to see you on a different network for a change.   that's what happens when you sell books.   i know. let's talk about what barbara starr was reporting from the pentagon. she says there is an acknowledgment from those officials that there are not enough ground troops in place and particularly in baghdad to control what our nic robertson is saying is a stage of anarchy in some parts of iraq. do you think the administration underestimated the day after?   i think because the day after came so fast and so suddenly in way. i think that there's been a pattern here not just with this administration, but over the last ten years, bosnia, kosovo, afghanistan, where we don't quite recognize when the old order collapses, you very quickly have to rush in and fill it with some kind of new order. in the short-term, that's going to have to mean the american military. but the key question, which i try to address in the book, is what do you do after that? what kind of authority do you create in a society going through this kind of transition.   and how do you know that the local iraqi citizens will make up this government or, in fact, interested in democracy? there's no proof of that.   well, the key here is the only way to get that kind of legitimate government to have it look good is to hold elections. but if you hold elections, you stop the whole process of building a rule of law, creating courts, creating administration. we've seen in the past in bosnia for example, you held elections and all of the old ethnic thugs get into power because they have organization and they have money and they stop the process of genuine building of democracy. there is this tension here which is the only way to make this look good is in some way get legitimate iraqi authority, but the faster you get that, the more likely you stop this process.   so what do you think of this interim government? you got deputy defense secretary paul wolfowitz saying that american and british military forces would play a leading role in setting up an iraqi government and then later draw civilians into the process. is that going to work?   i think it will work if it's truly broad-based and truly consensual, try and include all different people and including them in creating a constitution which would take a few years. what i point out is the plays where you've had quick transitions     2003-04-11 08:31:54  .

[ applause ]d the extra $400 per child to american families this year, 2003. all together these tax reductions will help 92 million americans. and a significant part of the benefit to our economy will come within the first two years of the plan. a family of four with an income of $40,000 would receive a 96% reduction in federal income taxes. instead of paying $1,178 per year, the family would pay $45 a year. [ applause ] that means extra money in the family budget year after year. that money can cover a lot of bills. that money can help families with purchases they have been delaying. that money will be in circulation, which will be good for our economy. [ applause ] and this plan will help our small business sector. the benefits of the growth plan will come from uncreased consumer spending and, as importantly, from a lower income tax rates on the small businesses themselves. it is important for our fellow citizens to understand that most small businesses pay their business taxes at the individual rates. most small businesses are sole proprietorships, limited partnerships, are subchapter ss, and, therefore, when you reduce individual tax rates, you benefit small business formation. as a matter of fact, under this plan, some 23 million small business owners will see their taxes cut. which leaves more money for investment, more money for growth, more money for job creation. a growing economy also needs small business investment. and our tax code should encourage investment. today a small business can deduct a maximum of $25,000 in the year in which they buy equipment. we need to triple the amount that can be deducted in the year in which they buy equipment. [ applause ] so i propose to congress that they ought to limit -- limit ought to be increased to $75,000 and that limit ought to be indexed to inflation. by doing so, we promote greater investment in machinery. and when a small business bias machine that enhances their company's product divty as well as it means machinery manufacturer is likely to have more work available. more investment equals jobs. and what we are interested in in this administration is helping people who look for work find a job. [ applause ] we can also promote economic growth and job creation by removing the double tax on dividends. [ applause ] taxing corporate income once is fair. it is not fair for the federal government to tax the same money twice. the burden of double taxation falls on the millions of individuals who receive dividends. falls especially hard on seniors who receive half of all dividend income. removal of double taxation would put more money in the hands of investors. it would encourage more investment in american businesses. economists say that this plan will help our stock markets, and since half of american families own stock, the reform will help them save and help our economy grow. now, these measures were presented to congress in the first week of this year. the pro growth package was urgent in january. it's even more urgent today. [ applause ] it is important for you all to understand and for our fellow americans to understand the tax relief that i have proposed and will push for until enacted would create -- [ applause ] will create 1.4 million new jobs by the end of 2004. in two years time, this nation has experienced war, a recession and a national emergency. which has caused our government to run a deficit. the best way to reduce the deficit is with more growth in our economy, which means more revenues to our treasury, and less spending in washington, d.c. [ applause ] i am pleased that both the house and senate have passed budget resolutions that show real spending restraint. and now the congress must focus on a robust and effective growth package. we need at least $550 billion in that package because the more tax relief that goes to the american people, the more jobs we will create in this economy. [ applause ] the last few months have been a time of challenge for america. our resolve has been tested. yet we have the great resources of national strength. and national character. to overcome every challenge we face. our confidence an our optimism have never waivered. we are defending the peace of the world. we're bringing freedom to corners of the world who haven't seen freedom in years. we're all building the prosperity of our country. this is a unique moment in our history and the american people are rising to meet it. i want to thank each of you for your hard work. i want to thank each of you for the faith you have shown in this country's future. may god bless you, and may god continue to bless america. [ applause ]     2003-04-15 11:42:46  .

    the coroner examining the remains of two bodies recovered near san francisco bay yesterday was unable to determine the cause of death. police are now considering the possibility that the remains are those of laci peterson and her unborn child. peterson disappeared on christmas eve of last year. paul vercammen joins me now from martinez, california, with the latest for us. paul?   reporter: well, lou, one thing that the coroner has been able to determine is that the skeletal remains are those of one, an adult female, and two, the remains of the almost full-term baby boy. and of course, this is significant because laci peterson, when she disappeared from her modesto home, was 7 1/2 months pregnant. that was on christmas eve. her husband, scott, at the time said that he was fishing in the berkeley marina. now, in a strange twist in all of this, just yesterday separate from the skeletal remains i alluded to earlier a man hiking near the berkeley marina found a bone, and they are now looking at that as another possible lead in this case.   this person came across the bone at the shore. he brought it home and contacted the authorities, and we took possession of it.   and you're trying to connect it to the other --   well, we're trying to find out if it's a human bone and whether or not it is related to the others.   reporter: and yet another reason why that bone could be a key link, there are reports that have surfaced that in terms of the female remains that were found the skeleton was not completely intact. now this case is also taking on a rather, we should say, almost a tv episodic forensic pathology angle because they're going to bring in an expert on what's called alufating decay, and basically this person is going to come in here and look at the body. this is in the damage aspect of it. and they say these experts will be able to tell how long the body had been in there and if the remains of the almost full-term baby boy were inside the female's remains at the time of death. also, the coroner could know right now but is not saying if there was some sort of trauma to either of these skeletons, for example, if they could see the bone compromised in some way they could tell if there had been a stab or a shooting. we may learn a lot more on this in just 15 minutes. that's because modesto police have scheduled a news conference and while they may not say much at all they could also drop some major bomb shells, lou. reporting live from martinez, california, i'm paul vercammen, now back to you.   paul, let me ask you, if i may, quickly, are we expecting -- is there any reason for us to expect that there would be the ability to identify those remains as a result of these autopsies this afternoon?   reporter: it sounds like all of this will be too quick, and it seems underlying all this is there could be an absence of dental records. that's particularly important for the adult female remains. so now they're going to have to turn to dna, and that's why they're calling in these experts. some dna testing can be very quick, but sometimes it can take up to weeks, even more, lou.   okay. paul vercammen, thank you very much. as paul just reported, the modesto, california police department will be holding a news conference just a few minutes from now, and cnn of course will be carrying that news conference live. stay with us.     2003-04-15 19:01:11  .

    general brooks talking about three major points. one is the capture of number 24 as it's described, samir who is responsible for the baghdad district, indications are the kurds in the north handed this man over so this is number 4 out of that playing card deck of 55 that the u.s. is after. top leaders in iraq. also that bomb site in baghdad hit about a week and a half ago, the mansour district. no remains identified just yet, general brooks says, but only the initial surveys have been completed so far. there is strong speculation that saddam hussein may be his two sons were inside of that building when it was hit by coalition bombs, or may have left prior to the bombing taking place. again, all this is an outstanding issue right now. in the north, you're going to hear a lot about the shallow graves today. at least 1500, maybe 1600 graves located in the north. jane arraf has made her way to that location and we heard her first live report about an hour ago and we will talk with jane again. we know that, quote, work will be done with the iraqis and that work will come, we are told, in the coming days. a wrap from centcom and here is fredricka whitfield at the cnn center.     2003-04-18 07:39:01  .

    tariq aziz's sun ziad looks worried. he's willing to talk with us, but not be interviewed. as he explains how his father negotiated his surrender. he says his father's night-time handover was dignified, that u.s. forces offered medical support for his father's heart condition, that has caused two heart attacks recently. they don't know when to expect him back, and have been told he faces lots of questions. outside, u.s. troops provide occasional protection. nearby, a neighbor hopes all will be well. another neighbor comes to our car to give his opinion. he was a normal person, he says. a good neighbor, but a bad politician. at their nearby store, they prepare to open for their first day of business since the war. aziz was a politician he said. it's saddam and the others americans have problems with. maybe he gives us information about the missing people, and perhaps saddam hussein. further down the road, these men wait for a ride. neither have anything bad to say about aziz. we call him mr. aziz, and i'm proud of him, says this former traffic cop. he was cultured, and i wish someone like him rules us. his friend adds, if all the leaders stayed in baghdad, then the americans will catch them. across town in a less affluent neighborhood, reactions to aziz's arrest are profoundly different. i didn't hear about it, explains this man, because we didn't have electricity. when we explained the news to the crowd, a bystander steps forward. america is playing a trick on us he says. where is our government and our security? at the pickle store, passions are enflamed by the lack of services. aziz is a war criminal says ahmed. he should get the death penalty, just like saddam, 60 times over. we give mr. bush six months to get things right he says, going on to explain, if not, we will fight the americans. the biggest problem tariq aziz' family says they now face is that aziz is now safely in u.s. custody, they don't know how safe they are out on baghdad's streets. nic robertson, cnn, baghdad.     2003-04-25 14:43:14  .

    we'll continue to watch this cramma unfold off key largo in florida. let's much on to another important story. it's happened, of course, several times during the war in iraq, journalists caught in the line of fire and killed. israeli troops are facing a similar situation with two journalists killed in just the past two weeks. here's cnn's cly wallace.   reporter: friday night in the gaza strip and a journalist is about to lose his life. shortly after several shots are heard an israeli bulldozer can be seen uncovering the israelis say, a tunnel used to smuggle weapons. moments later, three journalists who were covering that israeli action appear. one with tv labeled on the back of a bullet-proof vest, another carrying a white flag. judging from the videotape, they appear difficult to see in the darkness. and difficult to hear. after the journalists shout, another gunshot. moments later, another shot and the sound of someone in pain. 34-year-old british journalist james miller died on the scene after israeli soldiers come to his aid, the israeli defense sources says. he is best known for his work on two award-winning documentaries which appeared on cnn exposing the world to the taliban rule in afghanistan. now the foreign press association in israel is calling for an independent investigation.   james was not shooting and he was not with somebody shooting. so, again, to know exactly what happened we need a full-fledged inquiry.   the israeli government said its forces were returning fire and that miller was shot in the back, suggesting he could have been hit by palestinian gunmen. those close to miller believe he was shot by an armored israeli personnel carrier. we know the israelis fired. whether or not he was shot by israelis gunfire, we are not certain at this killed covering the israeli-palestinian conflict. with palestinian cameramen, shot and killed by an israeli soldier on the west bank in mid-april. with back-to-back deaths making a total of at least seven journalists killed covering the conflict in the past two and a half years.   this is very worrying and i believe the israeli army should take special measures to prevent this. the message from the israeli government is that its soldiers are not targeting journalists, but that journalists who travel to places where there could be live fire exchange between israeli forces and palestinian gunmen have a responsibility to take greater precautions.   they have to realize that this is not a game going on there. it's a life and death situation. soldiers are basically thinking about their own lives at that moment. they don't have time to hesitate. the israeli spokesman says the soldier his no choice, but to be there. journalists say     2003-05-06 17:32:57  .

    arthritis. * * we liberated the people of iraq from a brutal dictatorship. [translator speaking] we brought greater security to people of all nations. i want to thank the president for spain's diplomatic support before the conflict. [translator speaking] and for the use of spanish air space and bases as the war grew closer. [translator speaking] i also offer my condolences to the family and friends of the two members of the spanish media who lost their lives while covering the hostilities. [translator speaking] both spain and the united states are committed to a stable, democratic and peaceful future for the people of iraq. [translator speaking] spain has shown that commitment by sending engineering and medical units to help the people of iraq. [translator speaking] and i thank you for that help. [translator speaking] today, i have moved to ease sanctions imposed by the united states against iraq's old government. [translator speaking] first based on the authority recently given to me by congress i'm suspending the iraq's sanctions act, which restricts the export of certain commitment necessary for iraq's reconstruction. [translator speaking] secondly,'m directing the secretary to relax sanctions on american countries and citizens conducting business in iraq that contributed to humanitarian reconstruction. [translator speaking] soon, at the u.n. security council, the united states, great britain and spain will introduce a new resolution to lift the sanctions imposed by the united nations. [translator speaking] the regime that the sanctions were directed against no longer rules iraq. [translator speaking] and no country in good conscience can support using sanctions to hold back the hopes of the iraqi people. [trance lay or the speaking] across the globe, spain and america will continue as strong allys in the war against terror. [translator speaking] today, the united states took steps to cut off financing for the organization because of its ties to the eta. [translator speaking] we believe that the people of spain like everywhere have a right to live free from terror. [translator speaking] we'll also work for a better world beyond the war on terror. [translator speaking] we're committed to expanding trade which builds prosperity on both sides of the atlantic.

    "vanity fair's" come lumist daniel fair is here. quiting in the june edition, he describes the journey. he said he found evidence that hussein's day of reckoning well over due. christopher hitchens joins us from california. good to have you with us.   thanks for having me.   your journey, particularly to southern iraq, what is evoked there a sense of both that you evoke is a sense of history of this regime. give us your insights as to what you think the future holds.   do you mean if i start with the past?   not at you will. not at all i.   not much of a trip. i wasn't up the sharp end. i wasn't taking risks. i wasn't in a position that my dear friend was in when he was killed outside bagdad airport but i had long thought and i was in iraq in the previous war that really all the talk that had been about the rush to war, the push for war, the drive for war, all that propaganda, was essentially nonsensical because in 1990, saddam hussein made the only self criticism. he said, i could either invade kuwait or finish developing the nuclear weapon. maybe before the weapon and then later he said, oh, i should have got the nuclear weapon before i invaded. he was right about that. but that means that he inaugurated at that point like a dozen-year's war where the united states could be criticized for doing too little and acting too slowly but all we're arguing about lately is to do with those that should have been finished in '91 when it could have been finished. should have taken the side of the rebels then. taken the risk of supporting a shiite insurrection at that point. helping the kurds, removing the regime.   absolutely.   we'd be 11 years into nation building by now if we'd done that. that seems to be the core of the argument.   as you point out, of course, for the fact of the matter is, the mistakes of saddam hussein made possible his removal from power ultimately. the mistakes of the united states, again, as you point out, norman schwarzkopf making a peace, permitting helicopters to fly.   still hurts me to read this. the little town i was in this southern iraq, as far as i got, i can't boast of further, is where the talks took place. we have the transcript of the meeting. they say, okay, we have lost this round. do you mind if we keep your helicopters in the air just to be able to transport things? and he says, yeah, that's all right. they ask again, are you sure they mean that? they can't believe the luck. they use the gunships to kill, we think, not less than 50,000 inhabitants of southern iraq and trying to do that to the kurds, as well, so it was a knife edge. and it's not just been wise after the event, i believe, to say that there was an argument in realtime between the bush administration members. mr. cheney's the only one i know that changed his mind. most of those that took the view at that time, think until recently they were correct in saving saddam hussein.   of course, mr. cheney was in the chain of command with swars cough and --   many others.   when they made the decision not to move toward bagdad with bad information. namely, the republican guard absolutely devastated.   yes. and, well, we know now the harvest of all that. it hurts to think of how many wonderful people in iraq at the academic community, lawyers, human rights activists, civilians, intellectuals, people -- would now be alive. who have been horribly murdered and tortured and reduced to misery since by a half application of violence through sanctions and overflights.   mistakes made then, mistakes part of human experience, but now we have an opportunity not to make mistakes. is it your sense that the united states is on the right track? that there is the prospect here a commitment here on the part of the united states to     2003-05-08 18:33:04  .

    there's some shocking new information about the life of john f. kennedy, both before and during his days in the white house. the revelations are part of a just published biography about the 35th president. our jonathan karl takes a look inside the pages.   reporter: the revelations about kennedy's alleged affair with an intern make up just a couple lines in historian robert dowd's 700-plus page biography. the information comes from a single source, an interview with a former kennedy staffer who says she does not remember the intern's last game. although he finds the reports of kennedy's womanizing credible, he believes new information about kennedy's health problems is more significant. jfk's public image was one of youthful vigor but in truth he battled serious medical problems his entire life. twice before becoming president he was so sick, a priest was brought in to give him last rites. while researching his new book on jfk, dallic uncovered previously sealed medical records that detailed the ek tent of his medical troubles and the lengths he went to conceal them from the public. there are many stories about politicians who used political influence to get out of military conflict. but dallic shows he youed his family's influence to get into the navy just as america was on the verge of world war ii. in 1941, he flunked two military medical exams. his powerful father intervened, getting yet another exam. reading the report of his exam, one would think he never had a serious physical problem in his life. it was a complete whitewash that would never have been possible without his father's help. kennedy entered the navy earning hero status for saving his ship mates when his boat pt-109 was sunk by the japanese. dallek says kennedy's brushes with death, combined with his t deaths of his sister and brother, fueled the ambition to led him to become the youngest person elected president in american history. kennedy told a friend before he entered politics, you've got to live every day like it's your last day on earth. that's what i'm doing. jonathan karl, cnn, washington.   and we'll have much more on this story coming up later today on "wolf blitzer reports." the biographer will be among my guests later today 5:00 p.m. eastern, 2:00 p.m. pacific. the vice president dick cheney is now speaking in washington at a luncheon honoring the secretary of defense, donald rumsfeld, the vice president will be presenting the jimmy doolittle award to the secretary of defense. we'll be monitoring to hear what both of them have to say. we'll have some coverage of that coming up. but up next, andrew jackson is getting a makeover of sorts. and it's all in the name of fighting crime. we'll     2003-05-13 13:01:23  .

    we are back. it's been a few days since we had any new developments in the laci peterson case. it appears we do have something to talk about this morning. perhaps a search for some new evidence under way. let's check in with our rusty dornin, out in modesto, california, with the latest on that.   reporter: we knew it was a matter of time before police got back into the water in san francisco bay looking for more evidence in the laci peterson case. that happened this morning. numerous agency r agencies boats with sonar technology and divers into san francisco bay. they came from the richmond marina as well as the urbuinano island, the coast guard station. it's being used as a staging area. they are going to be launching a search for what may be left in the bay here now. as you know about a month ago laci peterson's body washed up right here. an area called point isabelle. right across the channel here is an area known as brooks island. they believe -- police say that is where scott peterson told them that he did go fishing the day that laci peterson did disappear. now, a source close to the investigation has told me that what they are really looking for are concrete anchors or weights which may have parts of laci peterson's body or clothing or something attached to it. that they did discover a concrete weight in scott peterson's wearhouse. if it matched, that would be something that could link scott peterson -- it would be like a smoking gun in this case. inevitably they are looking for something linked to laci peterson, whether     2003-05-16 11:33:19  .

    a series of commercials people are not as fond of featuring carrot top as he pitches for one of the oldest and most reared corporations in the land, at&t.   we're training here?   train your finger to dial up the center. it's free for you, and cheap for them.   carrot top's major exposure on the tube isn't just something that makes us curious. "fortune" magazine looked into his commercial appeal. there must be some. andy can explain why he's a hot commodity.   no, i can't explain at all. i want to sound off. this blows my mind. probably the most annoying person on the planet. i don't say that lightly. the most annoying person on the planet. here is this old blue chip company that uses him as a pitch man. i've never heard of this guy before they started doing these commercials. now he's more and more famous. he's hitting on girls, advertising long distance. what this is carrot top? does anyone like carrot top? it's disgusting.   i actually -- he flew under my radar. i called atlanta to get background on this guy. the san francisco chronicle did a survey with its readers of most annoying celebrities famous for just being famous. carrot top. kathy lee gifford number two.   he hasn't a celebrity until at&t ever made him one. anybody call you carrot top? auburn top?   nobody's a celebrity until the media makes him one. don't be picking on my friend susan. you're really exercised about this. he's trying to make a living. has somebody from your magazine spent time with him?   yes, and hates him as much as everyone else does. he spent ended up liking the guy.   maybe he's a nice guy, it doesn't have to be stockholm syndrome.   in defense of carrot top, he knows he's insane and annoying and acknowledges it.   he wrote carrot top is one of those c list celebrities who wormed their way into your consciousness without you knowing how it happened.   here's a story about a kid who's stormed into our consciousness, lebron james. the high school basketball phenom out of ohio. he just signed, only 18, a senior, has not played one nanosecond in the nba yet. yet already signed a sneaker deal that ap reports is worth more than $90 million. lebron james is expected to be cleveland's top pick after they won the number one pick in the nba lottery. nike is hoping the phenom will help boost their sales of basketball shoes to that crucial team market. and of course everybody's got an opinion whether the kid is going to skip college and go right into the pros, worth this kind of money. this is mega bucks. they only paid tiger woods $40 million for his deal coming out of stanford university. but he had an amateur golf career where he posted scores and did things comparable to what is done on the pga tour. nobody knows if this kid can play against shaquille o'neal or not.   nike and nba are looking for the next big thing. it's not only of course his basketball skills, which is unquestionable. but his personality. then if in fact the team he ultimately plays on, whether the cleveland cavaliers, or somebody else, whether they actually are any good.   name the starting five of of the cavaliers.   i can't, that's my point.   they had the lowest attendance in the nba. i checked it out. this guy,     2003-05-25 16:03:37  .

    as we said, earlier this week, christine todd whitman stepped doup and now a whole lot of analysis is taking place as to why she stepped down, the job she's done when she was in office and the job that has yet to be complete. from our new york bureau as i was introducing a moment ago, dan fagen, the environment writer for news day and dan, whitman did consider herself sort of the republican environmentalist. but now there's been an awful lot of monday night quarterback quarterbacking taking place now that she's teped down. what do you suppose took place here?   i think many people have watched thisstration in action and watched chis tee whitman in action. the mystery is that she took the job in the first place or didn't leave earlier. she was quite a misfit for this administration, and she showed that over and over. she was not good at all at communicating the administration's message to the public and certainly to the environmental groups and she was even worse at bringing the epa bureaucracy, the epa environmental policy makers' message to this administration because she saw herself undercut over and over.   that's interesting because leading into it, while she was new jersey governor, she sued the epa and she was very much considering herself to be an environmentalist, and then only to end up becoming the head of the epa and then of course, there was a lot of criticism over relaxed regulations. let's hear what she had to say last wednesday here on cnn just after announcing her resignation.   i'm not leaving because of clashes with the administration, in fact, i haven't had any. i report to the president, and he has always asked me to give him my best unadulterated advice. we have have been on the same page. i was never supportive of protocol because it didn't do what everyone needs to get done as far as climate change is concerned. i'm leaving now because it's the appropriate time to do it.   dan, do you agree with that? she says the appropriate time. do you suppose for personal reasons or perhaps she was out of step with the administration?   i'm sure that it was difficult for her personally, but i think the commuter marriage perhaps would have been less stressful if everyday she didn't see herself being undermined and overruledded. i mean if christy whitman and the white house were on the same page, i don't think i've seen a book large enough to contain a page that big. over and over there were many, many instances over the last     2003-05-25 17:33:42  .

    let's talk a little bit more about what the navy does to prevent such tragedies. we were talking about it this morning and we put together some graphics for you. i'll try to explain it the best i can from what i remember from being on the "uss abraham lincoln" this is an amphibious ship, rather, but this is what the navy does with regard to prevention. everybody that is, every sailor that's entersing the navy does take a swim test. they learn how to tread water and do the dead man float and they have to pass that in order to continue on. also drills take place before sailors get on to any ship, before any deployment, usually twice a day, they're practicing man overboard drills, knowing where to go, where to report to if indeed a man overboard takes place and as the deployment begins, those wane off, but they know where to go quickly. they also wear float coats. you can see them here. the yellow shirt is wearing a yellow float coat. everything is color coordinated. you see the gentleman here wearing a brown one and they have toggles to pull and inflate. they also have a manual device so if the toggles don't work they can blow air into the inflation device. they have dive goggles and they're able to find them. it also has a strobe light and a whistle. also such location devices, some ship have smoke floats they can toss out so the man overboard will be able to use smoke signals as a way of trying to find or locate, let the rescuer locate them. also 24/7 there are individuals on watch. all throughout the ship, all around the ship. and indeed, there is netting on most parts of the ship, not on entire all around the entire ship, but on most parts there is a very thick netting. now let's talk about the man overboard rescue and when indeed there is a man overboard situation. you will hear a p.a. announcement around the entire ship. there is a man overboard so everyone knows they have to react quickly. a ship-wide search will happen f. they don't see that person go overboard, but if indeed they do see someone go overboard, the ship starts to circle that area continuously. also small boats sometimes go out into the water, but even more importantly, helicopters are launched immediately. inside those helicopters rescue imswimmers. if indeed the man overboard is located, well the hoister is dropped down with usually a torso harness. if the man overboard is injured then they may use a basket, but more than likely those swimmers will go right into the water and try and help the swimmer hook up on that harness and pull them up into the helo and pull them back on to the ship for treatment and usually a search takes about 24 hours. the search crews will go 24 hours before calling off that search. why call it off? there's a number of reasons to look at. depending on the water temperature, it's very possible that or very common in cold water that someone will not survive a certain amount of time. also the reason for the 24-hour search is they fail they've exhausted all resources by that the "uss nassau" as those investigations continue for the two missing sailors.     2003-05-26 14:46:40  .

    night opens on the "uss john c. stennis." on this deployment they primarily fly after dark so the ship's schedule is upside down, the crew sleeps by day and works all night. this is day two of war time operations for the "stennis" and "operation iraqi freedom." for the next 12 hours into the morning, planes from the carrier will fly missions over afghanistan. there is only a faint orange light on deck, punctuated by this. to adjust their eyes for night vision, crew members make their way through passageways glowing in dim red light. on the flight deck, a walkover check for debris is lit only by flashlight. the dangers of the flight deck being blown overboard by jets, slight sliced by propellers or other hazards that are hard enough to avoid in daylight are all the more intense at night. the intricate coordination of launch and recovery plays out as a dance in the darkness. the complexity of it all has been described as a ballet and if it is a ballet, the choreographer of the flight deck is this man here. he is the handler.     2003-05-26 19:22:32  .

    adrenaline is high on the flight deck of this carrier at war. soon after dawn on this fourth day, confirmation of the ship's first strike.   fourth day of combat operations today bore fruit for the air wing and the ship team here. we had f-14 aircraft drop laser-guided bombs, f-18s drop joint direct attack munitions or j-dam weapons into eastern afghanistan today this is the first of an unknown number of strikes we'll conduct during our watch in "operation enduring freedom."   they'll come back high fiving and feeling pretty good about it but it is a bit of a somber event that they're going through out here. but the biggest thing you're seeing is the intensity.   reporter: the fighter jets dropped their ordnance in a coordinated atack on a convoy near the afghan city of choft. the pentagon says the convoy was taliban and al qaeda troops.   there was an attack on a convoy of leadership that was identified through various intelligence means. that was done within the last 24 hours.   reporter: but the strikes prove controversial. local afghans in the convoy say it was a group of elders on their way to the inaugural ceremony for interim afghan leader hamid karzai. analysts believe some tribal warlords may have taken advantage of american firepower by accuse ing rife aal leaders of being taliban and misguiding u.s. intelligence.   the consequence of injuring or hurting someone who is friendly or nonparticipant in combat is very difficult to deal with. a. and we go extreme details in -- and do a lot of training as well to make sure that doesn't happen.   we have dropped ordnance today. and i'm sure we'll continue to drop ordnance. and do it with precision, do it with accuracy, and do it on call when needed first time every   reporter: as the "john c. stennis" ends its first week of operations in the arabian sea, christmas is only a few days away. though a choir rehearses in the chapel for a christmas event, for the crew, it is another workday, their first day off won't be for another three weeks.   it is another day for me. when i'm out here, i don't look at a calendar, i don't think about it. i stay busy at work.   reporter: but there are other chances for the smip to gather like this moment of pride to honor sailors who earned a promotion in rank. it is called a frocking ceremony.   there is a sense of respect that you'll agree as you walk around this crew is there. as they take care of one another the whole community comes together they follow together as a team or they win together as a team. and i always encourage them to take care of themselves. because if they don't care of themselves, then it kind of all falls apart at the seams.   reporter: last time we saw this sailor he was washing dishes in the ghali. now he's been promoted. and pilots sarah "clutch" joiner and russ "gladys" knight say their final good-byes.   goggles down, let's go.   reporter: before boarding a cargo flight off the "uss stennis." they'll be home in time for christmas.   i've been here for four and a half years. it is probably family right now, or my family away from my family.   reporter: savoring every last minute on the ship, commander knight rushes to the flight only seconds before the door closes.   had is the best tour of my life. 19 years in the navy, it has been the best tour of my life.   reporter: for the rest of the crew, there is five more months to go in this deployment. and no one knows how long america's new war on terrorism will keep the "uss john c. stennis" engaged in battle. on highest alert as a carrier at war.   we continue with the pride and professionalism we have shown to date, we can't do anything but be successful. please make sure you take care of your ship, take care of yourselves,     2003-05-26 20:03:43  .

    first an update on a long running air safety investigation a year and a half near an airline crashed near new york's kennedy airport there is controversy whether the disaster could have been averted. 265 people died in the november 2001 crash of flight 587. hard to forget those images. after the pilots lost control of the plane, and the jet's tail fin broke off. airbus strongly denies claims it failed to provide sufficient warning. but critics say airbus should have sounded a stronger alarm after a similar incident occurred in 1997. that is when american airlines flight 903 ran into trouble on a trip from boston to miami. the pilots of that plane forcibly applied their rudder to recover from a stall, and as a result the plane's tail section exceed its design limits. pilots managed to land safely, only after a terrifying ordeal for passengers. melanie joyceon joins us from dallas. thanks for being with us. can you tell me about the flight five years ago. what happened to you?     2003-05-27 20:09:43  .

    that standing ovation that sammy sosa got at wrigley field last night. a major league baseball official is skilledded to conduct interviews in chicago. those interviews could be a factor as the league decides how sammy sosa will be punished for using a court-filled bat. our gary tuchman is live. good morning.   reporter: the cub's player this afternoon, once again, sammy sosa will be in the lineup but he could find out as early as today what his punishment will be and how many games he'll be suspend for. last night when he went to play for the first time, most of the fans on wrigley field gave him a standing ovation. in all fairness, not all of them totally believed sammy sosa but he's a hero here and they want to believe sammy sosa. he hit the ground ball on the first inning, that scored a run, but the run was taken away. sosa was quicked out of the game after he was found out he had a cork during the bat. he meant not to use it during the game, but he did use it during the game. major league baseball took 76 of his bats and x-rayed them for cork.   those x race were negative. that was conducted by a trained radiological technician. we believe the x-ray process was sufficient to determine the state of those bats and we're very confident that all of those bats were clean and had no foreign substances within them.   it was a mistake. we're all human and we all made a mistake. nobody's perfect in this world upon.   reporter: last night with the bat, we assumed was not cork, sammy sosa struck out the first three times up. he did hit a single in the ninety inning in a losing effort for the chicago cubs. back to you.   there's a concern with the huge series there this weekend with the yankees coming to town that sammy would be suspended during that.   the yankees vpts been to wrigley field since the 1930s since they played the cubs in the 1930s. sosa could get a suspension, but he could appeal suspension. so if he wanted to play against the yankees, he probably will be able to.   gary tuchman in chicago. thanks so much. let's bring jack back in with the question of the day and bill's also joining us from d.c..   hello, william.   over your shoulder, jack.   keeping an eye on us. martha stewart unfairly singled out for prosecution or is she getting what she deserved? jim in new york, i've des piesed martha stewart for years before the imclone scandal, but all this prosecution does is how bias prosecutors are when they deal with moguls who strip the hopes of investors. ceos, sleaze walk free, market should be free to stroll right along with them into the ceo hall of shame. joe in michigan, prosecute, when your skit in life is professing trust and integrity and you violate that responsilibity to your believing public, then you should be done.   jude nith florida, says eye never liked martha, but now she's a part of good     2003-06-05 09:34:02  .

    all lumber, no filler. that's the verdict after baseball officials x-rayed sam why sosa's entire inventory of bat and found no evidence of cork or any other substance. that seems to support his contention that the bat got him ejected tuesday night was a fluke. still a decision on what, if any punishment he will face in the wake of that incident tuesday night. gary tuchman standing by in chicago, with the latest on the sosa saga outside of wrigley field.   reporter: leon, hello to you. three hours from now the chicago cubs take the field against the tampa bay devil rays here at wrigley field and sammy sosa will be out there with them but how long will he? we could find out today. his punishment, suspension for using a corked bat for use -- which is illegal during a game. since the incident 33,000 fans in the stands for a night game he received a standing ovation from almost all of them. i heard a few boos but almost everyone standing. not everyone believing this man's story, which is it was a mistake but he's a hero here. these people want to believe his story. it happened tuesday night. in the first inning he hit a ground ball. scored a run. when he hit the ball, the bat broke. the umpires found cork in the bat. it's illegal because when you put it in the bat it makes the meat lighter. they hollow out the bat and stick the cork in there to mask the hollow sound. then you can swing it lighter and you can swing it faster. they took 76 of his bats for analysis. they x-rayed the bats. the x-rays all came back negative. but did major league baseball have all of sammy sosa's bats?   we are, as i said, confident, based on not only the presence of security in the club house but also the level of cooperation, the record keeping that we reviewed and so forth, that we have all of the bats. so i don't want anyone to misconstrue what i said. it is conceivable because we didn't have physical presence in the club house that we do not have them all but we are very confident that we do.   i'm man enough to take everything that i've done for. and i still walk yesterday like a man and take the blame. but the media today, they got it like i'm a criminal and that's something that really bothered me and hurt me as a man.   reporter: now, why did sammy sosa have this corked bat? well, he says he has it because he uses it for batting practice to put on a show for the fans. they asked him how many times he's used it during batting practice and he says three or four times. that raises the question does major league baseball have a rule about using corked bats during batting practice. we asked     2003-06-05 11:34:10  .

    bringing you up to date on a breaking story out of the middle east. in gaza, a pair of israeli gun ship attack, aerial attacks that have threatened to derail the road map to peace, as it is called. in the first attack, a car carrying rantissi, a senior member of the hamas group, a militant organization, was targeted. he survived, with wound, but two people were killed. 27 others were injured in that attack. the second attack occurred after some rocket firings aimed, apparently, toward the israelis, apparently in retaliation. we're checking our facts on that one. that is just unfolding. the white house saying, and the president directly quoted as saying, he was deeply troubled by that initial attack. still no reaction to the second attack. the details on that still inconclusive. the president, quoted by ari fleischer, his spokesman, is saying he's concerned the strike will undermine efforts by palestinian authorities to bring an end to terrorist attacks and does not contribute to the security of israel. clearly some frustration with the sharon government in israel in the wake of these attacks in gaza.     2003-06-10 13:33:42  .

    welcome back to "people in the news."   the intifada, the spontaneous 1987 palestinian uprising against the israeli occupation, heralded the rise of the muslim fundamentalism. in what had been a mostly secular palestinian movement. the most popular of these groups hamas, an acronym for islamic resistance movement. in english it means zeal, its aim -- the destruction of israel.   hamas is an islamic movement. at the very beginning, it was encouraged by israel because they thought it was a counter weight to palestinian nationalism which is, of course, a secular movement.   hamas was founded in 1988 by a blind paraplegic cleric who was influenced by the islamic muslim brotherhood, with backing from israel, he set up sharities in the improverished strip in the 1970s.   slowly it became more and more politicized, and more and more extreme in its demands for an islamic state.   the extremism took the form of suicide bombings and terrorist attacks. but hamas had already become an important part of palestinian society through its charity work and its influence increased over time by providing community services when the palestinian authority did not.   hamas plays on the palestinian authority's failure to produce. its basic message, the palestinian authority is corrupt, it fails to deliver, hamas is not corrupt. hamas cares about the person on the street and it does deliver. unfortunately, those same charitable organizations, those same charity committees that funnel the funds to needier palestinians, also serve to support terrorist attacks.   israel and the united states say arafat has not been tough enough on terrorism, and have attempted to force him out of the current peace process. the prime minister known as abu mazen must now contend with the rejection of side by side palestinian and israeli states. a cornerstone of the new peace plan. he's trying to get hamas to co- exist with israel. conservative israelis are skeptical.   he is not working against hamas, he is working in tandem. he is negotiating with them. he is not telling them to disband and regulate their weapons, so i have no faith in the ability of abu mazen to put terror aside.   reporter: settlers call the just concluded israeli-american- palestinian summit a surrender, and were not impressed.   translator: the armed intifada must end and we must use and resort to peaceful means in our quest to end the occupation and the suffering of the palestinians, and the israelis, and to establish the palestinian state.   hamas and other palestinian militant group rejected abbas' call to end their attacks with a deadly raid on an israeli army outpost in gaza.   we are all saying that the resistance will continue despite the summit in aqaba.   israel retaliated on hamas, namely al-rantissi, it missed him and killed civilians.   translator: hamas will not drop our weapons, even if all leaders are assassinated.   reporter: since the second intifada began in 2000, over 700 israelis have been killed, during the same time there have been more than 2,000 palestinian deaths according to the red crescent. including hamas leaders targeted for assassination.   if you want an end to terrorism, if you want an end to violence, you have to give people hope and you have to give them a stake in the political process. i think that hamas is ready to join the political process, however, if the only price for the political price is you must fight hamas, if that's what they are requiring abu mazen to do, they are almost mandating that he will fail.   the main test of mahmoud abbas, will be to establish an overall command of all armed groups, if not, it doesn't have a chance. you know, leaders have to do things     2003-06-14 18:04:27  .

    seven minutes before the top of the hour. at the beginning we told but this incredible story about the rescue of three fishermen in the waters off the coast of vancouver, stuck in the waters, gail force winds, small boat, they were rescued by a cruise ship that happened to be in the neighborhood. those three men didn't realize how lucky they were until they were plucked out of the water. we have with us captain kent ringboard, on board the royal caribbean "radiance of the seas." i understand you were on board when this rescue happened. were you in charge?   yes, that's correct i was in charge.   tell us about what happened here. what was it you were looking at when you looked out over the waters?   well, it was quite windy, gusty winds up to 40, 50 miles an hour. and it came from southeast. and we got the alarm this distress situation just before 5:00 in the morning. and we were on relatively slow speed for the time being, but we of course, speeded up to the position, which was given, and we -- after an hour, we spotted the fishing boat in the waters.   these men were in some water that was quite frigid. if they stayed out there for long they could have suffered severe tragedy, perhaps. i want to ask you, have you ever done anything like this? have you ever seen anything like this done?   no, i have never seen this type of operation where you have a fishing vessel disappear, more or less. and that the survivors, they had to go into the water, pick them up from the water.   was there any point at which you didn't think you would be able to pull it off?   sorry, please say again?   was there any point at which you thought you wouldn't be able to pull it off?   no, absolutely not. we -- we were 100% sure we could make it, absolutely. because we came very close to the vessel. we had our rescue boat out soon. so i felt confident about it. i saw the fishermen also had the surviving suits on. so that gave me more time to help.   that was a good thing for them. what about your crew that was actually involved in the rescue here? are they trained for this sort of thing?   yes, they are very much well-trained. we train for this type of operation at least every 14 days.   i'm hopeful those three fishermen bought you a glass of wine once you got them on board.   we gave them some.   these incredible pictures. i'm not sure if you have been able to see some of these pictures playing on the television sets around the world but we look at these pictures and think there's no way a cruise ship, as big as it is, will be able to maneuver into position in these kinds of heavy seas to save three corks out there on the water. amazing.   it was interesting. but we had a good maneuvering capability on     2003-06-17 12:03:37  .

this could stop the whole thing   sure. we got calls that morning saying "did you hear that they're halting all travel?" and we put in a call to the agency. we were going. and we put a lot of trust in our agency. and they were great. you know, unless we were absolutely stopped, we were going.   right. after two years of working towards it, we were almost more afraid not to go than to go at the very end.   you know, mark, i hope this isn't too personal a question. if it is, just simply tell me to shut up. but when -- in the story i saw abby was abandoned on the side of the road, which is just -- it's unthinkable. you can't even imagine a parent doing that. what do you think you're going to tell her when she grows up about how she came to live with you?   well, i get emotional every time i -- someone asks that. but we're going to give her the best love and affection we can and give her a strong self esteem and we're going to teach her     2003-06-17 20:03:36  .

    the nasa and the european space agency both launch missions to mars this month sending rovers and ashters to probe the red planet. one of the big questions about mars is when or whether humans will ever be able to visit. it's an idea plagued with unsolved problems. the latest issue of "popular science magazine" takes a look at the challenges nasa is facing. joining us is the contributing editor. good to see you, jeff.   thank you.   it was only about 30 years ago when we went to the moon. so what's the difficulty in being able to go to mars?   it's unimaginably difficult and different. mars is at most trip. then if we stay there for about a year or two, the whole trip could last about three years. we're talking about conditions where there's radiation in space cosmic radiation that could cause cancer. the communications conditions once you're on mars, just to talk to people on earth, there's a 20 minute delay in the conversation. so the -- you know, the issues are so much larger than going to the moon.   and for now, it's 250 days, which seems to be the maximum for astronauts in space anyway. but as you say, it's a much further travel. but let's talk about some of the hurdles that hamper humans to be able to survive there. the dust, for one thing. cataracts another. let's talk about the right kind of spacecraft that would be able to allow humans to actually get that far and to survive.   right. well, first of all, the spacecraft would not be launched from earth. you'd have to launch is from in space already, which means we would have to build it in space. so that means we need a good shuttle that's going to take us back and forth to build the spacecraft. then we have to come up with the fuel that will take it out of the earth's orbit all the way to mars. that's probably going to be nuclear propulsion at this point again something we haven't really developed yet, because we couldn't carry that much fuel, obviously. liquid oxygen would be way too heavy to carry all the way to mars. the bigger issue is once we get there, we can't carry oxygen or water or food to stay there three years, so we're going to have to do all of that on the surface of the planet. and think of it. mars is carbon dioxide. so we can't breathe there. so we're going to have to come up with some conversion technique to create water, to create oxygen and then some way of growing food on the planet itself. all of this is in the works now, but i think it's going to take quite a few years to develop it.   you talk about the cosmic radiation. then of course there is the zero g bone loss, almost like the eroding of bone to humans that would be at risk as well.   absolutely. there could be as much as 50% bone loss in astronauts in mars.   why?   during the time in mars. because when the body has -- when there is no dpravity as there is on mars, the body doesn't pick up the calcium in the bones, so it doesn't keep getting the bones stronger and stronger. so they will just lose it. they will be almost like old people even at the age of 40.   jeff rothfeder. thank you for joining us. looks like it will be some time before we make our way to mars. that's it for us. but before we go, a look at what's coming up next week. a controversial incinerator just about ready to destroy weapons at an anniston, alabama, military facility. what might be the risk to people downwind. that story and much more coming up next week. coming up next on "cnn live sunday" a look at america's storage of gas. that's followed by "people in the news" profiling harrison ford and harry potter. at 8:00 eastern, cnn presents road to baghdad.     2003-06-22 18:03:01  .

    an occasion that marked the formal establishment between our two countries. since then this relationship has grown in importance to us both through good times and bad. both of my generation and britain have special pause to remember the unacceptable sacrifice the russian people made to defeat fascism in the second world war. nothing, not even the fact that our countries became estranged in the war's aftermath, has ever dimmed our memory of the scale of your loss. that experience should continue to inspire us, as we seek to build a more peaceful and secure world. when i visited your country in 1994, i recall saying to president yeltsin that he and i spent most of our lives believing such a visit would never happen. and that i hoped he was as delighted as i was to be proved wrong. i'm just as delighted now, nine years later, to be able to welcome you here and to learn about the great changes which have occurred in your country since i was there. russia has established itself as our partner and our friend. we work together bilatarily and on the international stage. and we are developing new links all the time in fields of commerce, culture, counterterrorism, energy, education environment. i know you will be seeing evidence of some of this during your visit. mr. president, it is, i believe, a sign of genuine friendship that we are able to have disagreements, but remain firm partners. it is no secret that the significant differences between our two countries earlier this year on how best to handle iraq. but we are now able to look forward together firmly in agreement on the route we have decided in the united nations. although, the tragic loss of british lives today reminds us all of the difficulties to be faced. but as we look ahead, we know that our long-term partnership is of profound importance to both of us. this is clearly evident, if we look beyond the challenges of international politics. in the last few months alone, we have heard the announcements of major investments in russia by british companies. we have also heard a different sign of sir paul mccartney playing to enthusiastic crowds in red square. and we, in turn, have been enthralled by the celebrations of your own city in petersburg. at the same time, work continues to bring the young people of our countries closer together through language, teaching, school exchanges and university programs. we have a vibrant and exciting relationship from which we both derive mass benefit. mr. president, your country is rich --     2003-06-24 15:56:33  .

    how could so many people end up in prison for crimes they didn't commit? the story behind the defendants of tulia, texas, is our "headlines timeline." july 23rd, 1999 -- there was a massive drug bust in a predominately african-american neighborhood in tulia. of the 46 people arrested, 39 are african-american. the case against them was based on the testimony of undercover officer thomas coleman. coleman claimed he bought drugs from the defendants, but offered little or no supporting evidence. after the first of several trials ended with convictions and harsh sentences, most of the other defendants pleaded guilty to avoid hard time. march 17, 2003 -- with coleman's credibility under serious attack, new hearings for the tulia defendants get under way. the hearings are stopped when the judge, defense attorneys and prosecutors agree that coleman lied under oath and is a racist. coleman denies doing anything wrong. it took a special act of the texas legislature to clear the way for monday's release. but these men and the others caught up in the tulia tragedy are still convicted criminals. now it's up to the appeals court and the board of pardon and paroles to officially clear their names.     2003-06-16 23:25:58  .
