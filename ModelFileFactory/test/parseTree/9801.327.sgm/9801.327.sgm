0 485 9801.327 NEWS STORY SOURCE : The Washington Post SECTION : A13 ; LENGTH : 872 DATE : January 13 , 1998 HEADLINE : Embattled Census Director Quits ; Riche Leaves in Midst of Sampling Dispute , Preparations for 2000 Count BODY_LEN : 824 The nation 's census director , after fighting with Congress for two years over how to conduct the next population count , announced yesterday she is quitting , leaving unfilled a critical leadership position as the nation heads into the 2000 census .
486 760 Martha Farnsworth Riche said that the dispute with Republican congressional leaders did not directly lead to her resignation , but several people who know her well said she was frustrated by the political battle and the prospect that it would continue for another two years .
761 983 `` This is going to be a brutal fight , '' said Rep. Thomas C. Sawyer -LRB- D-Ohio -RRB- , who has been closely involved in the census and is among those who believes the ongoing debate played a role in Riche 's departure .
984 1226 Replacing Riche will be , by all accounts , enormously difficult , given the disagreement over the census that divides the Clinton administration and the Republican leadership in Congress , whose approval is necessary for Senate confirmation .
1227 1500 The dispute centers on a technical question with broad political repercussions : Republican leaders , particularly in the House , are adamantly opposed to the administration 's plan to combine head counts with statistical estimates to arrive at a national population count .
1501 1813 Riche , backed by a National Academy of Sciences panel , has argued steadfastly that in order to improve its accuracy , the census should rely more than ever before on sampling , which gathers information from a random selection of households and then uses that to extrapolate characteristics for a larger group .
1814 2027 The idea is to get a better gauge for accounting for millions of Americans , predominantly poor and minorities , who have been missed when the government has relied almost exclusively on a door-to-door head count .
2028 2189 Sampling , because it would increase the numbers of minorities counted in the census , is generally considered likely to benefit Democrats more than Republicans .
2190 2347 With that issue unresolved , the bureau is heading into the final planning stages for the 2000 census , a $ 4 billion effort that will employ 300,000 people .
2348 2382 Rep. Dan Miller -LRB- R-Fla . -RRB-
2383 2488 , who heads the House subcommittee that oversees the census , said he was startled by Riche 's departure .
2489 2606 `` I have expressed my concern that we are rapidly headed toward a failed census in 2000 , '' he said in a statement .
2607 2655 `` Riche 's sudden departure adds to my anxiety .
2656 2861 ... '' Riche said yesterday she was leaving to pursue other interests , including writing and teaching , and an administration source said she had been offered a lecturing position at Princeton University .
2862 2995 `` I have done what I came to do , '' she said , citing improved methods of collecting and managing the nation 's statistical system .
2996 3089 She said she had not made a commitment to the administration to stay through the 2000 census .
3090 3320 Riche has in the past expressed her frustration that the controversy over sampling had forced her to focus most of her attention and energy on the 2000 head count , while the agency is also responsible for numerous other projects .
3321 3352 `` I want a life , '' she said .
3353 3376 `` This is a tough job .
3377 3445 I ca n't tell you how many people say , ` That 's a thankless job . '
3446 3542 Why would somebody want to stay in a thankless job when they 've done what they wanted to do ? ''
3543 3729 Riche , 58 , an economist who helped found American Demographics magazine , took office in 1994 , the day before the electoral victory that gave the Republican Party control of Congress .
3730 3780 Others say Riche was in an nearly impossible role .
3781 4041 `` The difficulty in that position is being stuck between the scholarly community , advising her how to take a good census , and the political community , reacting to political forces , '' said William O'Hare , a demographer with the Annie E. Casey Foundation .
4042 4204 A Commerce Department spokesman said the administration would begin the process of appointing an acting director soon and then search for a permanent replacement .
4205 4422 However , several congressional sources expressed concern that replacing Riche with someone who meets Republican approval could be difficult , because any nominee 's position on sampling could emerge as a litmus test .
4423 4593 It is unlikely the White House would nominate a successor who did not support sampling , and equally unlikely Republican leaders would look favorably on such a candidate .
4594 4799 That raises the prospect that the position could go unfilled for a long period , even as the Census Bureau conducts its rehearsal of the census this spring and begins final preparations for the 2000 count .
4800 5010 According to the administration 's plan , census employees would attempt to collect a questionnaire from every household , but then contact a statistically representative sample of people who failed to respond .
5011 5182 The results of that sample would be used to arrive at a total population figure and the race , income and other characteristics of those who could not be counted directly .
5183 5361 Republicans , particularly those in the House , have maintained that such a process is subject to manipulation , less accurate than a traditional head count and unconstitutional .
5362 5526 In the appropriations bill approved late last year , Congress allowed the bureau to test sampling this spring , but vowed to renew the fight before the 2000 census .
