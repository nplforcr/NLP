0 95 CNN19980325 .1600.1536 NEWS STORY The man at the helm of Titanic is setting records of his own .
96 163 James Cameron won three statuettes at the Academy Awards on Monday .
164 225 Dennis Michael talked with him about what makes Titanic sail .
226 253 I 'm the king of the world .
254 397 James Cameron may not be a world ruler , but his crown as the reigning king of Hollywood is pretty secure following Monday night 's Oscar gala .
398 561 He came home with three personal Oscars for editing , for best director and , of course , best picture , something that has never happened before in Oscar history .
562 661 Hollywood 's King James the first still finds his position at the pinnacle something of a surprise .
662 720 There 's a certain aspect of how the hell did this happen ?
721 804 You know , um because i - it sort of uh goes against everything you think you know .
805 858 uh Not that I did n't believe in the picture , I did .
859 946 But I - I certainly never thought that it would enter these , you know , higher strata .
947 996 uh And I do n't think anyone did , quite frankly .
997 1147 I mean , we thought you know , we 'll break even , make a little money , and we 'll have felt good , very worthwhile doing it , but nothing like this .
1148 1210 For Titanic , it was a virtual parade of winners Monday night .
1211 1344 The film 's art direction , costumes , sound and sound effects , music and song were all honored , as were the heroic visual effects .
1345 1451 But Cameron says no single element , even his script or direction , is responsible for Titanic 's success .
1452 1492 It 's greater than the sum of the parts .
1493 1529 The spectacle alone would not do it .
1530 1567 The love story alone would not do it .
1568 1647 A love story , as separated from Titanic , would not have been a - as powerful .
1648 1751 A Titanic story without the love story to give you an investment in it would not have been as powerful .
1752 1889 But you put it all together and it 's doing something u - t - clearly to the hearts of audiences in all cultures , you know , everywhere .
1890 1924 It 's a chemistry of the elements .
1925 1982 And if you take one thing away , there 's a diminishment .
1983 2037 You take another thing away , there 's a diminishment .
2038 2141 You put them all together , and you achieve an effect that 's , you could call it a synergistic effect .
2142 2231 And Cameron 's acceptance speech at Monday night 's academy awards may have been a first .
2232 2335 He asked for a moment of silence to remember the souls lost aboard the real Titanic in nineteen twelve .
2336 2457 But an awareness of the reality of the tragedy has always been at the heart of the effort to bring Titanic to the screen .
2458 2539 The film does , you know , uh try to embrace a kind of uh a kind of noble spirit .
2540 2684 And that that 's a lot of what is intriguing about Titanic as a , as a subject , and I , uh , you know , y - you want to try to live up to that .
2685 2824 And I think that that 's a lot of what was going on during the making of the film , too , for the , for the crew , for the people involved .
2825 2874 We were all trying to live up to the the subject .
2875 2932 Oscar night caps a titanic achievement for James Cameron .
