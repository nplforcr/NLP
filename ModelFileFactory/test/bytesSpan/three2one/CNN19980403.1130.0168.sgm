0 144 CNN19980403 .1130.0168 NEWS STORY Independent counsel Kenneth Starr may be considering a new strategy in his investigation of President Clinton .
145 171 Bob Franken has the story .
172 355 With the Paula Jones case set aside , at least for now , independent counsel Ken Starr is deciding exactly how he will pursue the allegations against the president and his associates .
356 503 The crimes that we have been charged with , uh , investigating are subordination of perjury , intimidation of witnesses and obstruction of justice .
504 574 Sources tell CNN , Starr 's office is discussing a tough new approach .
575 737 Some of his more aggressive prosecutors are recommending he indict Monica Lewinsky and name President Clinton an unindicted co-conspirator in an alleged cover-up .
738 951 While the conventional wisdom has been that Starr would turn over his findings to congress , the new scenario would give him a better opportunity , advocates argue , to publicly air evidence against the president .
952 1116 Lewinsky would be charged with perjury and subordinating perjury for trying to get Linda Tripp to lie under oath during her deposition with Paula Jones ' attorneys .
1117 1283 One hitch , sources say , is the fight with Lewinsky 's lawyer over his claim she has already been offered a binding immunity deal which would preclude this scenario .
1284 1339 That fight is awaiting a ruling by the presiding judge .
1340 1454 Starr continued to push his investigation calling White House chief of staff Erskine Bowles before the grand jury .
1455 1527 The real question that we 're examining is , wh - were crimes committed ?
1528 1638 But some lawyers challenge whether Starr still has grounds to continue this probe because of the Jones ruling .
1639 1681 Among them , a former independent counsel .
1682 1869 Under the federal statutes , even though a person lies under oath or gets somebody else to lie under oath , unless it 's material , unless it hurts someone , it 's not , not prosecutable .
1870 2028 There are also still several important witnesses yet to appear before the grand jury , including Linda Tripp , and Lewinsky , depending on the immunity fight .
2029 2058 And there 's Kathleen Willey .
2059 2224 CNN has learned that she was scheduled to give another deposition in her home town of Richmond to Paula Jones ' attorneys this Saturday over the objections of Starr .
2225 2252 That problem has gone away .
