Times News Service dLR ; dQC ; dQL ; NAGANO , Japan _ The final Winter Olympics of the 20th century opened Saturday with a spare , traditional celebration of Japanese culture that broadened into an idealistic call for international peace and brotherhood .
711 906 With a U.S. military attack on Iraq possibly imminent , the president of the International Olympic Committee called on all nations to refrain from conflict during the 16 days of the Winter Games .
907 1141 It was his hope , said Juan Antonio Samaranch , that the IOC 's appeal for a worldwide Olympic truce `` will foster international dialogue and diplomatic solutions to all conflicts , in an effort to bring human tragedies to an end . ''
1142 1411 After 2,450 athletes from 72 countries marched into Minami Stadium , and the revered Japanese figure skater Midori Ito lighted the Olympic flame , nearly 20 minutes of the two-hour opening ceremony were devoted to a soaring performance of Beethoven 's `` Ode to Joy . ''
1412 1625 The climactic movement of Beethoven 's Ninth Symphony is performed at every Olympics , according to the wishes of Pierre de Coubertin , the French baron who is considered the father of the modern Olympic movement .
1626 1776 But Saturday 's performance was particularly ambitious and stirring as it incorporated both musical and technological virtuosity of the highest order .
1777 2047 As 50,000 spectators gathered under a milky midday sky , jubilantly filling a stadium ringed by the majestic Japan Alps , `` Ode to Joy '' was performed by choruses from five continents , linked simultaneously by satellite and symbolizing the interlocking Olympic rings .
2048 2226 Seiji Ozawa , music director of the Boston Symphony Orchestra , conducted 200-member choruses in New York ; Berlin ; Beijing ; Sydney , Australia ; and Cape Point , South Africa .
2227 2376 They were all connected by time-lag technology to 90 singers in the Nagano Prefecture Culture Hall and 2,000 singers at the opening-ceremony stadium .
2377 2577 The performance , accompanied by 80 ballet dancers ringing the floor of the stadium , was an inspiring , if temporary , validation of the symphonic and Olympic ideal that all men will become brothers .
2578 2686 The themes of transporting unity and accord into the 21st century resonated throughout the opening ceremony .
2687 2815 Some 2,000 balloons shaped like doves were released into the air , carrying messages of peace written by the children of Nagano .
2816 2989 An underlying message in the third postwar Olympic Games in Japan is the country 's desire to reckon with an expansionist past by promoting a future of peace and friendship .
2990 3188 `` The Japanese have a considerable responsibility for the wars of the first half of the century , '' Keita Asari , the executive producer of the opening ceremony , told reporters earlier this week .
3189 3276 `` From that perspective , peace in the century ahead has a particular significance . ''
3277 3370 The opening ceremony avoided ostentation in favor of simplicity , hospitality and efficiency .
3371 3489 As well as a festival of solidarity and athleticism , the Nagano Games are viewed as a homage to the beauty of nature .
3490 3604 The exterior of the opening-ceremony stadium is shaped like petals of a cherry blossom , Japan 's national flower .
3605 3722 Saturday 's ceremony began with the solemn ringing of a bell from the Zenkoji temple , the spiritual heart of Nagano .
3723 3851 Eight wooden pillars , hewn from trees felled in local forests , were erected in pairs to signify the four gates of the stadium .
3852 3963 Akebono , the massive grand champion sumo wrestler , then entered the stadium to perform a purification ritual .
3964 4179 Dressed in a loincloth in the 30-degree chill , the 6-foot-8-inch , 516-pound wrestler stamped his feet to drive out evil spirits , symbolically readying the Nagano Games for contests of sportsmanship and fair play .
4180 4320 `` Being from Hawaii , I do n't know too much about the Winter Olympics , '' said Akebono , a native of Oahu whose given name is Chad Rowan .
4321 4339 `` It 's exciting .
4340 4421 We 're probably the first sumo wrestlers to ever be in the opening ceremonies . ''
4422 4549 Sumo wrestlers also accompanied each of the 72 Olympic delegations into the stadium , walking hand in hand with schoolchildren .
4550 4641 The children wore sweaters bearing the flag colors of the country that they were escorting .
4642 4806 Included in the parade of nations were Kenya , Azerbaijan , Venezuela , Macedonia and Uruguay , which were all participating in the Winter Games for the first time .
4807 4980 Carrying the flag for the U.S. delegation , which consists of 196 athletes , was the four-time Olympian Eric Flaim , a speed skater who has previously won two silver medals .
4981 5140 He seemed a curious choice to many , considering that Flaim qualified as a pool member of the short-track relay team and may not compete at these Winter Games .
5141 5279 Flaim , 30 , of Boston , said he was dedicating his flag-carrying honor to his late father , Rico , who got him involved in winter sports .
5280 5373 Greeting the Japanese delegation from the royal box were Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko .
5374 5515 The country has enjoyed limited success in the Winter Games , and its most famous medalists played significant roles in the opening ceremony .
5516 5675 Yukio Kasaya , a ski jumper and the only Japanese athlete to win an individual gold medal in the Winter Games , helped carry the Olympic flag into the stadium .
5676 5790 Kenji Ogiwara , who won two gold medals as part of the Nordic combined team event , delivered the athletes ' oath .
5791 5970 And Ito , whose silver medal at the 1992 Winter Games is the only medal ever won by a Japanese figure skater , lighted the Olympic cauldron dressed in a traditional Japanese robe .
5971 6279 -LRB- STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS -RRB- Preliminary rounds of the Olympic hockey tournament began after Saturday 's opening ceremony , with the first full day of competition set for Sunday in the men 's downhill , snowboarding , speed skating and the pairs short program in figure skating .
6280 6354 Heavy snow is forecast , which could force a postponement of the downhill .
6355 6595 After exorbitant budget increases , early lack of public support and a bitter controversy over placing the start of the downhill in an environmentally sensitive national park , the Nagano Games began with a sense of anticipation and relief .
6596 6720 `` The Games will work , '' said Anita DeFrantz of the United States , the only woman to serve as vice president of the IOC .
6721 6769 `` Nobody thought they would , but they will . ''
6770 6970 While transportation concerns persist in this clogged city of 360,000 , IOC members seemed satisfied that Nagano would avoid the traffic and technological failures of the 1996 Summer Games in Atlanta .
6971 7164 `` This shows you can actually plan an Olympic Games ahead of time and not write code as the spaceship is heading toward the moon , '' said Dick Pound , an influential IOC member from Montreal .
7165 7291 What remains to be seen is whether the IOC appeals for an Olympic truce will hold during the Nagano Games , which end Feb. 22 .
7292 7480 The Japanese foreign minister , Keizo Obuchi , has urged the United States to refrain from hostilities with Iraq during what he called the `` last sports festival of peace this century . ''
