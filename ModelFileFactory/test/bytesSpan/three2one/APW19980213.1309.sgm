MONEGRO dQC ; dUR ; Associated Press Writer dQC ; SANTO DOMINGO , Dominican Republic -LRB- AP -RRB- _ Dominican authorities have arrested a doctor sought by U.S. authorities for defrauding the Medicare system for millions of dollars while practicing in New York .
508 769 The arrest of the politically well-connected Dr. Rafael Gonzalez Pantaleon represents another step by Dominican authorities toward increased cooperation with the United States , which is seeking extradition of numerous suspects hiding out in their home country .
770 950 Gonzalez Pantaleon , a former government official and political party leader in this Caribbean nation , was convicted in New York in 1996 of defrauding Medicare of dlrs 20 million .
951 1080 He was sentenced to six and one-half years in prison and fined dlrs 5 million , but he fled the United States while free on bail .
1081 1343 Officials said Gonzalez Pantaleon was arrested Thursday , one day after U.S. Undersecretary of State John Hamilton met with President Leonel Fernandez to ask for the extradition of 30 drug trafficking and murder suspects believed to be in the Dominican Republic .
1344 1437 Extradition of Dominicans is a controversial topic made more complicated by conflicting laws .
1438 1562 While a 1910 treaty permits extradition , a law passed in 1969 prohibits Dominicans from being turned over to other nations .
1563 1618 But the latter law did not abolish the previous treaty .
1619 1684 Fernandez has urged a new law be passed to clear up the conflict .
1685 1829 Last year , Fernandez handed over to U.S. authorities two suspects accused in U.S. courts of multiple murders , drug trafficking and conspiracy .
1830 1938 Fernandez justified the extraditions by saying that the country could not become a haven for fleeing felons .
