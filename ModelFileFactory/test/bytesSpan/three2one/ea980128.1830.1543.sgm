250 358 And he said he had no personal knowledge of any sexual relationship between Mr. Clinton and Monica Lewinsky .
359 461 So finally tonight , our regular report on some of the ways in which the government spends your money .
462 488 Medicare fraud is one way .

613 661 But how about career criminals being in the act ?
662 753 ABC 's John Martin reports tonight on a man who will tell his story to the Senate tomorrow .
754 795 Miami , Florida , a glamorous night life .
796 865 Perfect for a con artist who ran nightclubs and laundered drug money .
866 909 But his most lucrative business , Medicare .
910 941 Is it a good way to make money ?
942 962 That 's a gold mine .
963 975 A gold mine ?
976 983 um Yes .
984 1004 Call him John Smith .
1005 1085 He took the federal government for fourteen million dollars before it caught on .
1086 1121 Was it easy to fool the government ?
1122 1126 Yes .
1127 1140 Really , yes .
1141 1159 The fact is , yes .
1160 1197 I did , and many like me still do it .
1198 1324 Here 's how , they buy patient ID numbers from doctors or thieves , then bill the government for services they do n't provide .
1325 1404 The information they buy costs about two hundred and fifty dollars per patient .
1405 1473 The Medicare payments they receive run nearly three times that much .
1474 1521 Some crooks do n't even provide real addresses .
1522 1605 This windy , noisy runway at Miami International Airport is the scene of the crime .
1606 1674 The crooks used this address for a phony medical equipment business .
1675 1770 They got away with two million dollars because the government never sent anybody here to check .
1771 1811 Crooks count on that lack of inspection .
1812 1886 They listed this laundry , these drop boxes , even this empty store front .
1887 1912 You laundered drug money .
1913 1956 You were in w - i - the nightclub business .
1957 1993 And you 're in the medical business .
1994 2030 Which is the best way to make money ?
2031 2037 Bueno .
2038 2047 Medicare .
2048 2093 Medicare was better than drugs or nightclubs ?
2094 2097 Si .
2098 2203 The problem is Medicare does n't pay enough attention to screening out unethical people at the front end .
2204 2326 That allows completely bogus businesses with no experience in health care at all to get into the system and to rip it off .
2327 2450 On the eve of Senator Collins ' hearings into Medicare 's failures , the government finally says it plans more inspections .
2451 2535 Last year , the lack of them helped lead to losses of more than two billion dollars .
