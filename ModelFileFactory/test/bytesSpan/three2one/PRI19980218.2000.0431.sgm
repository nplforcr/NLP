113 264 As Kofi Annan prepares for his last-ditch try for a diplomatic solution to the Iraqi crisis , he 's getting good wishes and warnings from US officials .
265 369 The UN secretary general departs this weekend for Baghdad to meet with Iraq 's president Saddam Hussein .
370 551 A White House spokesman says there 's been no indication from Iraq that would lead anyone to be optimistic about the trip , but , he continued , it is important to make this effort .
552 597 Even Annan admits he has a difficult mission .
598 754 US and British officials have cautioned that they wo n't accept any settlement short of complete , unfettered access to all suspected weapons sites in Iraq .
755 888 Joseph Nye , dean of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard , puts the secretary general 's chance of success at less than even .
889 958 But he does envision a scenario for a short term diplomatic solution .
959 1348 It 's conceivable that if Saddam believes that the punishment that he would a - absorb from the military strike can be avoided and that he can reap the gains of diplomatic support and domestic support while avoiding the punishment , he just might feel that it 's worth acceding to what Kofi Annan would ah put forward and then uh play the whole game again in six months or a year from now .
1349 1413 Do you think Kofi Annan is going to have to offer him something ?
1414 1790 I think Kofi Annan has to he may be able to offer him some cosmetic things like adding additional groups or or nations to the inspector teams and so forth , but he ca n't , I believe , accept uh Saddam 's desire to exclude large areas as he now uh is excluding from inspection or to have what you might call rigged inspections in which you have teams without technical skills .
1791 1867 So I think those are going to be the parameters within which he has to work .
1868 1960 All of this comes as the UN announces it 's pulling out humanitarian personnel from Baghdad .
1961 2022 It sounds like they 're preparing for a strike , does n't it ?
2023 2176 Well , I think as I said , I think the chances are are better that even that Saddam will not cave in at the last minute and that there would be a strike .
2177 2413 But uh it 's certainly important for Kofi Annan to go to Baghdad and see if he can get the UN inspections back in because that 's probably the uh one of the best ways to keep Saddam 's weapons of mass destruction programs under control .
2414 2534 And if we have a strike and lose the inspection system , we 're not the better off for it , we 're the worse off for it .
2535 2578 How do you rate Kofi Annan as a negotiator ?
2579 2636 I think uh Kofi Annan is a extremely skillful negotiator .
2637 2690 I think he 's been an excellent uh secretary general .
2691 2806 I think what he 's doing now is what a secretary general should do , but he 's got a very narrow window to work in .
2807 2891 Will he have enough respect in Baghdad , or will they see him as an American puppet ?
2892 2995 Well , I think they 're , they have to uh see him as the , the best interlocutor they 're going to get .
2996 3178 He has to , obviously , steer his way through a security council where there 're some divisions among the major powers , and uh they will hope that they can play on that uh division .
3179 3330 But uh Kofi Annan has at the same time to realize that if he loses support of any of the five major powers , his mission will not have been successful .
3331 3543 So Baghdad 'll try to put Kofi Annan in an awkward situation , and , and Kofi is going to have to see whether he can negotiate something in the narrow constraints that would meet approval of the security council .
3544 3582 Thank you for joining us on The World .
3583 3604 You 're very welcome .
