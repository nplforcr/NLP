165 440 Probe Enters New Phase BODY_LEN : 871 Democratic contributor Johnny Chung has told Justice Department investigators that top Democratic National Committee officials knowingly solicited and accepted improper donations from him , according to sources familiar with his account .
441 641 Chung , as part of a plea bargain deal with the department , has claimed that then-DNC finance director Richard Sullivan personally asked him for a $ 125,000 donation in April 1995 , the sources said .
642 817 Sullivan took the money despite having previously voiced suspicions that Chung was acting as a conduit for illegal contributions from Chinese business executives , they added .
818 887 Sullivan 's lawyer said he denies Chung 's account of their dealings .
888 1061 Chung 's accusations come as the Justice Department 's 19-month investigation of 1996 campaign fund-raising enters what law enforcement sources characterized as a new phase .
1062 1376 Having brought charges this spring against four contributors who allegedly funneled illegal foreign funds to Democrats , the task force handling the campaign probe is now determining whether there is sufficient evidence to charge any of the DNC officials or Clinton-Gore campaign operatives who accepted the money .
1377 1596 `` The task force is moving to another stage that is going to involve people in responsible positions in campaign fund-raising and whether those people should be charged , '' an official close to the investigation said .
1597 1943 But Chung 's allegations have not persuaded investigators to designate Sullivan or any other DNC official as a target of the probe , a formal step that can be a prelude to an indictment , and the task force still hopes that other witnesses will agree to cooperate , including possibly Sullivan himself , according to sources close to the inquiry .
1944 2169 Justice Department officials emphasized that there is a considerable distance between a witness 's allegation that an individual should have known an action was wrong and establishing criminal intent to support an indictment .
2170 2435 Chung , a Los Angeles businessman , became the task force 's first major cooperating witness in March as part of an agreement in which he pleaded guilty to orchestrating an illegal `` straw donor '' scheme to give money to the 1996 Clinton-Gore reelection campaign .
2436 2651 Chung provided the task force with its first explicit account of foreign funds coming into the 1996 campaign , telling investigators that a Chinese aerospace executive gave him $ 300,000 for political contributions .
2652 2891 `` Johnny Chung is fully cooperating with the entire probe and that includes providing details of his interaction with DNC officials , including Richard Sullivan , his primary point of contact there , '' said Brian Sun , Chung 's attorney .
2892 2953 Overall , the DNC took $ 366,000 from Chung in 1995 and 1996 .
2954 3101 All of that money was eventually returned after the election when the committee determined it had `` insufficient information '' about its origins .
3102 3410 Chung , who visited the White House at least 49 times , is perhaps best known for an incident that was the subject of extensive congressional testimony in which he offered to make a $ 50,000 contribution to the DNC if he could bring five Chinese businessmen to a March 11 , 1995 , presidential radio address .
3411 3461 Sullivan has testified that he rejected the offer .
3462 3608 Instead , Chung sought help from aides to Hillary Rodham Clinton in gaining access to the radio address and the DNC eventually accepted the money .
3609 3917 In congressional testimony last summer , Sullivan said he had grown suspicious because `` Johnny had a very nervous kind of an outward , aggressive personality , '' and that he eventually concluded that the money Chung was offering to contribute was not his own but came from the Chinese business executives .
3918 4266 Sullivan 's attorney , Bob Bauer , said , `` Richard 's testimony , which is fully corroborated , is clear that he was concerned with the way Chung operated and on that basis he would not accept Chung 's offer of money as the price of admission to a presidential radio address or for any number of other initiatives that Chung was interested in . ''
4267 4457 According to Chung , however , Sullivan contacted Chung less than a month later and solicited $ 125,000 from him for an April 8 , 1995 , fund-raiser at the home of director Steven Spielberg .
4458 4667 Sullivan has denied to investigators that he asked Chung for the donation , although he has acknowledged that he was involved in accepting the funds at the DNC , according to sources familiar with the inquiry .
4668 4924 Chung has also told Justice Department investigators , the sources said , that DNC and Clinton-Gore officials were aware that he was bringing foreign guests to a September 1995 Los Angeles fund-raising dinner when he arrived with an entourage of 20 people .
4925 5080 At the event , campaign officials rejected Chung 's $ 20,000 check because contributions to the dinner were subject to a legal limit of $ 1,000 per person .
5081 5204 The following day Chung had 20 friends and employees write individual $ 1,000 checks , which were accepted by the campaign .
5205 5348 Chung later reimbursed the check-writers in what he acknowledged in his guilty plea was an illegal scheme to evade federal contribution limits .
5349 5614 `` Chung claims it was transparent on that occasion and virtually every other that he was producing contributions on behalf of foreign nationals who could not legally give to political campaigns , '' said a source familiar with Chung 's statements to investigators .
5615 5897 With the task force 's chief prosecutor , Chuck LaBella , preparing to leave his post this summer , Justice Department officials expect that decisions will be made in coming weeks on whether to press charges against DNC and Clinton-Gore officials who accepted illegal foreign funds .
