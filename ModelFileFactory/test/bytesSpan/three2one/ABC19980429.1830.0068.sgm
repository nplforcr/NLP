0 287 ABC19980429 .1830.0068 NEWS STORY Ever since the country learned as much as it did about President Clinton 's relationship with Monica Lewinsky , the crucial questions were , what did they do together , if anything , and what did he ask her to say about their relationship , if anything ?
288 355 And has the President told the country the truth or broken the law ?
356 509 From the beginning , Miss Lewinsky 's attorney has insisted she would certainly not talk to a grand jury unless she were given immunity from prosecution .
510 580 ABC News has now learned that her lawyer has lost an important battle .
581 624 We go to Washington and ABC 's Jackie Judd .
625 804 For weeks , the case involving Monica Lewinsky and President Clinton has been in virtual limbo while the judge considered what the ground rules would be for Lewinsky 's testimony .
805 991 Her lawyer , William Ginsburg , had gone to federal court arguing that Kenneth Starr had reneged on a deal to shield Lewinsky completely from prosecution in exchange for her cooperation .
992 1154 Sources say Lewinsky was prepared to admit that she did have a sexual relationship with the President , but not that he encouraged her to lie about it under oath .
1155 1272 Now , lawyers familiar with the investigation have told ABC News that Judge Norma Johnson has ruled against Ginsburg .
1273 1291 There was no deal .
1292 1334 Ginsburg and prosecutors declined comment .
1335 1365 Starr now has several options .
1366 1444 He could force Lewinsky to appear before the grand jury with limited immunity .
1445 1537 That would still give him the ability to prosecute her based on evidence provided by others .
1538 1659 Or Starr could bypass the grand jury altogether and indict her as a means of presenting evidence involving the President .
1660 1693 Lewinsky has an option , as well .
1694 1816 If she is brought before the grand jury , she could refuse to testify , although that could land her in jail for contempt .
1817 1877 It 's high stakes for the central character in this scandal .
1878 1911 And the next move is up to Starr .
1912 1918 Peter ?
1919 2058 Jackie , if I understand it correctly , a grand jury in Arkansas today heard the testimony that Mrs. Clinton gave on videotape on Saturday .
2059 2094 Current questions or old questions ?
2095 2109 Old questions .
2110 2140 No Lewinsky-related questions .
2141 2250 Questions relating to the mid eighties when she was a lawyer , when Mr. Clinton was the governor of Arkansas .
2251 2409 Her lawyer said today Mrs. Clinton refused to answer two questions about conversations she 'd had with her husband , the President , citing spousal privilege .
2410 2490 That is , a husband and wife can not be compelled to testify against each other .
2491 2545 we do n't we do n't know the subject of those , right ?
2546 2560 That 's right .
2561 2580 Okay , many thanks .
2581 2607 Jackie Judd in Washington .
