0 507 9804.390 NEWS STORY SOURCE : The Washington Post SECTION : A14 LENGTH : 594 DATE : April 04 , 1998 HEADLINE : Leader of French Far Right to Appeal Ruling That He May Not Hold Office BODY_LEN : 581 PARIS , April 3 - PARIS , April 3 Jean-Marie Le Pen , the leader of France 's far-right National Front party , today said he will appeal a court ruling denying him the right to hold office for two years , hinting at a government scheme to suppress his movement when it is showing its latest ripple of strength .
508 816 `` It 's only in totalitarian countries that courts are used to eliminate political adversaries of the powerful , '' Le Pen said the morning after a judge in Versailles ruled that Le Pen had shoved and insulted a Socialist candidate running against his daughter in last year 's national legislative campaign .
817 973 The incident occurred in Mantes-la-Jolie , in a tightly-contested district near Paris , at a rally for Marie-Caroline Le Pen , the National Front candidate .
974 1190 Witnesses and video footage indicated that Le Pen and his bodyguards had accosted a group of counter-demonstrators that included Annette Peulvast-Bergeal , the Socialist candidate and eventual victor in the district .
1191 1381 `` We 've had it up to here with you , '' Le Pen told Peulvast-Bergeal , yanking the tricolor scarf around her neck and pushing her to the ground , shaking off efforts to break up the melee .
1382 1475 He and his bodyguards also punched and verbally abused other demonstrators , the court found .
1476 1595 Later , Le Pen , 69 , a former paratroop commander in Algeria , was quoted as saying , `` That made me feel younger . ''
1596 1745 The judge 's ruling also stripped Le Pen of the right to vote for two years , fined him $ 3,800 and gave him a three-month suspended prison sentence .
1746 1940 The judgment could force Le Pen to give up his seat in the European Parliament and his place on the regional governing council in southern France , where the National Front 's political base is .
1941 2245 Le Pen 's status in the European Parliament may not protect him from prosecution by German authorities for another incident , in Munich last December , when Le Pen repeated a favored belief that the systematic extermination of 6 million Jews by the Nazis would be remembered as a `` detail '' of history .
2246 2407 The prosecutor 's office in Munich asked the German government today to lift Le Pen 's parliamentary immunity so it can prosecute him for inciting racial hatred .
2408 2516 The request is to be referred to the European Parliament , where Le Pen is one of 11 National Front members .
2517 2693 A French court in December fined Le Pen $ 50,000 for the Munich statement , which was nearly identical to one he made in France 11 years ago , for which he was fined $ 200,000 .
2694 2818 He and other National Front leaders have been censured frequently by French courts for making antisemitic or racist remarks .
2819 3019 Le Pen 's party , which these days draws 15 percent of the vote in French elections by espousing a credo of French nationalism and racial purity , has roiled the political waters here in recent weeks .
3020 3207 The center-right presidents of three regional councils elected March 15 have wrested power from Socialists , the top vote-getters , by accepting the support of National Front councillors .
3208 3404 The controversial deals were the first concrete admission by the French mainstream right that it may have to do political business with a party the French Establishment is loath even to recognize .
3405 3684 President Jacques Chirac , responding to the crisis unleashed by the National Front 's inroads on the regional level , is trying to formulate a `` renewal '' of the French political system and , less overtly , a rescue of the political right that includes his own battered party .
3685 3827 Chirac 's ongoing discussions with top political figures across most of the spectrum do not include any consultations with the National Front .
