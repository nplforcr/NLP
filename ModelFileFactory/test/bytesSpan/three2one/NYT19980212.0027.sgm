McQUISTON dLR ; dQC ; dQL ; dUR ; c. 1998 N.Y. Times News Service dLR ; dQC ; dQL ; ROOSEVELT , N.Y. _ A Long Island school administrator known as a problem solver has been named to head a state panel struggling with the task of reforming the troubled Roosevelt School District , the first ever to be taken over by the state .
582 839 The state Board of Regents appointed Dr. Anthony J. Pecorale , who has served as superintendent of several Long Island school districts , to be chairman of a three-member panel that will exercise state authority over Roosevelt schools through the year 2000 .
840 1066 Pecorale succeeded Dr. Daniel Domenech , the former superintendent of the Western Suffolk Board of Cooperative Educational Services , who resigned several months ago to become superintendent of schools in Fairfax County , Va. .
1067 1280 His departure , which followed several disputes with Roosevelt officials over budgetary matters and the direction of the 2,800-student school district , came at a crucial midpoint in the five-year takeover effort .
1281 1579 The takeover of the district 's six schools was ordered in January 1996 by the Board of Regents , which cited poor academic performance by a disproportionate number of Roosevelt students , lack of textbooks , poor sanitary conditions and buildings in disrepair and in violation of fire safety laws .
1580 1816 Although the fire violations and many of the other problems have been addressed over the last few years , disputes within the community have hampered the local school board from functioning effectively and continue to threaten progress .
1817 1942 Of immediate concern is a dispute over whether the district should condemn its 70-year-old Washington-Rose Elementary School .
1943 2072 The district operates on a tight $ 33.3 million budget , which was approved after much debate and community resistance last year .
2073 2144 Pecorale said he was prepared to address Roosevelt 's problems quickly .
2145 2238 He said his first priority was to consult with community leaders before making any decisions .
2239 2369 `` I have high expectations for the school district and my No. 1 priority will be quality education for the students , '' he said .
2370 2466 `` I want to hear from the students as well as their parents and members of the school board . ''
