499 771 It has been 28 months since Nigeria 's military government executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa and other dissidents to quash demands of local tribal communities , notably that they be allowed to share in billions of dollars of oil profits pumped from beneath the Nigerian delta .
772 873 Authorities keep tight military control on the delta , with frequent arrests of suspected dissidents .
874 1023 But opposition to the government and its oil policy is growing , especially among the young , according to residents and Nigerian political scholars .
1024 1109 The government has long contained dissent by co-opting or intimidating tribal elders .
1110 1363 But the delta 's continued poverty and environmental problems have radicalized youths who `` no longer recognize the elders ' authority , '' said Chinedu Uchegbu , a researcher for the Port Harcourt-based Institute for Human Rights and Humanitarian Law .
1364 1491 Protests and violence that began with Saro-Wiwa 's Ogoni tribe continue to spread among other groups , crimping oil production .
1492 1727 As Nigeria 's military ruler , Gen. Sani Abacha , appears to be aiming to keep power despite his promise to permit elections and civilian rule by autumn , many Nigerians worry that political uncertainty could slide into civil upheaval .
1728 1768 The worries appear deepest in the delta .
1769 1987 Tangled in the conflict are oil companies -- including American firms Texaco Inc. , Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. -- that for years have been the government 's business partners in pumping and selling the delta 's oil .
1988 2238 Environmental and human rights groups have condemned oil companies -- particularly the British-Dutch giant , Royal Dutch\/Shell Group of Cos. -- for environmental damage and accused them of complicity in the repression of dissidents , notably Ogonis .
2239 2377 Shell is trying to repair its image with a year-old human rights policy and funding for a broad development program for delta communities .
2378 2570 But Nigerian scholars warn , and some company officials concede , that the effort can do little against political repression and poverty in the delta as long as the military continues to rule .
2571 2620 Nigeria 's oil industry boomed in the late 1960s .
2621 2763 The more money it earned , the more the military tightened its control , declaring in 1969 the government 's sole ownership of mineral rights .
2764 2929 For decades , the delta 's mostly rural farmers and fishermen have seen little benefit from tens of billions of dollars ' worth of oil pumped out of their homelands .
2930 3099 In Nigeria 's joint venture with Shell , which produces almost half the country 's oil , the government takes about 70 percent of the sales price , Shell officials said .
3100 3200 Twenty percent pays production costs , Shell gets about 5 percent and minor partners share the rest .
3201 3318 Theoretically , the government is supposed to send 13 percent of gross oil revenues to develop `` oil communities . ''
3319 3484 But villages still lack electricity , running water , schools and clinics , and residents say the development money is being diverted to enrich government officials .
3485 3616 `` The only safe thing to say is that money is flowing '' for what are supposed to be development projects , a Shell official said .
3617 3665 `` We do n't know what is flowing or to whom . ''
3666 3823 In 1990 , the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People launched protests , demanding a share of royalties , a halt to oil spills and political autonomy .
3824 3931 The government responded brutally , with sweeping arrests and military raids on villages seen as dissident .
3932 4140 The protests radicalized and violence spread , in part , according to Nigerian scholars , because authorities used government-appointed tribal chiefs to encourage fighting among Ogonis and neighboring groups .
4141 4204 By 1993 , Shell was forced to halt its operations in Ogoniland .
4205 4341 In 1994 , after four Ogoni tribal leaders were slain , Abacha 's government charged Saro-Wiwa and eight other Ogoni leaders with murder .
4342 4458 A special tribunal , widely criticized as unfair , convicted them of murder the following year and they were hanged .
4459 4552 The executions shattered the Ogoni protest campaign , forcing many of its leaders into exile .
4553 4695 In Ogoniland , a farming district east of Port Harcourt , a military unit , the Rivers State Internal Security Task Force , continues to rule .
4696 4868 In its latest crackdown , in January , it arrested at least 40 Ogonis , `` not bringing charges -LRB- but -RRB- simply locking them away , '' said Uchegbu , the researcher .
4869 5000 Troops recently have raided churches , warning ministers to stop preaching about environmental or other political issues , he said .
5001 5148 Nineteen Ogonis , imprisoned on the same murder charges made against Saro-Wiwa , have yet to be put on trial nearly four years after their arrests .
5149 5268 Beyond Ogoniland , there has been `` an unprecedented militarization of the -LRB- delta -RRB- region , '' Uchegbu said .
5269 5465 He and others said a new anti-crime patrol by police and troops , called Operation Flush , is intimidating people in oil field villages where protests and violence have increased in the past year .
5466 5664 Last year , hundreds of people died around the city of Warri when young men of the Ijaw and Itsekiri tribes battled for weeks with cutlasses and automatic weapons over control of a local government .
5665 5737 Government troops eventually regained control , but the dispute simmers .
5738 5874 Protesters routinely occupy and close oil platforms and other facilities to get government attention for their communities ' grievances .
5875 5994 Near Warri last year , protesters seized several pumping stations , holding 127 Shell workers hostage for several days .
5995 6089 In the Nembe district , young men often shut down Shell 's oil pumps , as they did last month .
6090 6248 At the same time , youths of the Koluama tribe occupied a Texaco offshore oil platform , demanding electricity , potable water and work for their communities .
6249 6321 Such protests routinely crimp oil production by 5 percent to 10 percent .
6322 6577 Delta communities complain that continued oil spills foul their lands and waterways , but Shell says most leaks in recent years have been caused by people drilling or cutting into pipelines in hopes of getting compensation from the company for the spills .
6578 6771 Isaac Osuaka , an activist with a Nigerian group , Environmental Rights Action , said there is no way to verify Shell 's account because government agencies are underequipped to monitor spills .
6772 6907 `` And this government is the majority owner '' of the Shell-run production company , `` so how independent do you think it will be ? ''
6908 6917 he asked .
6918 7080 Following global protests about police brutality and the Ogoni leaders ' executions , Shell has distanced itself from the government 's use of force in the delta .
7081 7212 In earlier years , Shell worked closely with Nigerian security agencies , helping to fund the police that protected its facilities .
7213 7387 The company now resists calling for police help and `` will not operate behind a security shield , '' said Victor Dania , Shell 's public relations director in Port Harcourt .
7388 7646 Shell says it has `` on many occasions publicly appealed for an early and fair trial '' of the 19 Ogonis still held in connection with Saro-Wiwa 's case , and Dania said the company has delivered that message privately `` at the highest government levels . ''
7647 7732 But Dania conceded there has been `` no public response '' from Abacha 's government .
7733 7884 Human rights groups say Shell is failing to exert the influence it holds as Nigeria 's business partner in exporting nearly half of the country 's oil .
7885 7952 They say Shell should publicize its position widely within Nigeria .
7953 8179 Given that oil provides the military government with 80 percent of its revenues , `` I understand how people think we have a lot of influence over the government , '' said Rob Cornish , a senior Shell manager in Port Harcourt .
8180 8200 `` But we do n't . ''
8201 8201 .
