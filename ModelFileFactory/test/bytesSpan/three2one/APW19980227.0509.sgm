407 631 More than 100 delegates from 26 countries attended a seminar at Ewood Park , home of Blackburn Rovers Football Club , to discuss ways of combatting violent troublemakers during this summer 's month-long tournament in France .
632 831 With a record 32 nations taking part , teams criss-crossing the country for each game and demand for tickets far outstripping the supply , hooliganism shapes up as the World Cup 's biggest nightmare .
832 923 `` The football hooligan is a violent criminal , '' said British Home Secretary Jack Straw .
924 997 `` He is a coward who hides behind the good name of the decent supporter .
998 1179 My message to the hooligan is simple : We know who you are , we know what your plans are and we will do everything we can to stop you bringing disgrace and shame to this country . ''
1180 1320 While hooliganism has been largely brought under control in England , traveling English fans continue to pose a huge security threat abroad .
1321 1443 `` We have to deal with the tiny minority who want to use football matches as an opportunity for violence , '' Straw said .
1444 1498 `` Modern professional football originated in England .
1499 1562 I am proud that we exported the game to all parts of the world .
1563 1703 `` But I am ashamed that we also exported football hooliganism , and that we have such experience of dealing with hooliganism in England . ''
1704 1886 Straw announced that Britain was re-launching its `` Hooligan Hotline , '' giving fans a chance to call a toll-free number to tip off police about planned activities by soccer thugs .
1887 2068 He said the British government was negotiating with the French to help prevent hooligans convicted in France from then traveling back to cause further trouble during the tournament .
2069 2221 In addition , courts in Britain have the authority to impose `` restriction orders '' on convicted hooligans , preventing them from traveling to France .
2222 2367 Straw said British intelligence officers and `` police spotters '' would track known troublemakers and report their movement to French officials .
2368 2443 `` The French will welcome with open arms the law-abiding fan , '' he said .
2444 2625 `` However , they will bring the full force of the law down on those who cause trouble and there will be 24 hour judges near the stadia to mete out swift justice to the hooligan . ''
2626 2799 With England allocated only 9,128 tickets for its first three games , there are fears that large number of fans will travel to France to purchase tickets on the blackmarket .
2800 2921 `` The sale of tickets to rival fans in the same part of the ground is just a simple recipe for disaster , '' Straw said .
