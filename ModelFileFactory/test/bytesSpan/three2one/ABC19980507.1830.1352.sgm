82 143 Tomorrow , something called Deep Impact is scheduled to open .
144 201 And later in the summer , we 're going to get Armageddon .
202 346 They are both trying to capitalize on the notion that here on Earth we are in danger from monster asteroids or comets hurtling in our direction .
347 433 So , given what we 're going to go through with the movies , let 's go to the science .
434 460 Here 's ABC 's Ned Potter .
461 485 Annihilation from above ?
486 519 It 's all over the movie screens .
520 547 Somebody dial nine one one .
548 577 It happened to the dinosaurs .
578 629 And scientists believe such calamities are routine .
630 743 Things that could send civilization back into the Dark Ages probably happen every several hundred thousand years .
744 780 There 's now evidence to prove that .
781 909 A new report says two hundred fourteen million years ago , eighty percent of life on Earth may have been wiped out by asteroids .
910 1054 We now suggesting that there may have been five such ah events ah that may have been ah occurred within as brief a period of time as four hours .
1055 1135 David Rowley 's team studied impact craters that seem unrelated on a modern map .
1136 1315 But when you turn back the clock two hundred million years to where the continents were before they drifted to their current positions , the craters are almost in a straight line .
1316 1384 Indicating that the body that collided with Earth came in in chunks .
1385 1419 And you know , bang , bang , bang .
1420 1556 That 's precisely the kind of bang , bang , bang that happened only four years ago , as fragments of a comet went crashing into Jupiter .

1619 1706 ah The firestorm that resulted was ah in in each case was as large as the planet Earth .
1707 1828 As large as Earth or as small as sand , at cosmic speeds , even the tiniest debris in the solar system can spell trouble .
1829 1896 Each November , the Earth passes through the orbit of an old comet .
1897 1973 Once every thirty-three years , the dust from that comet is unusually thick .
1974 2100 The problem is that we 've never had one of these cosmic dust storms when there were five hundred working satellites in orbit .
2101 2144 Some of them could actually be knocked out .
2145 2181 Every satellite is going to get hit .
2182 2235 The question is how often and by what size particles ?
2236 2267 It is still safe to go outside .
2268 2357 A mile wide asteroid hits us , on average , only once every three hundred thousand years .
2358 2440 To scan the sky for danger , NASA 's doubling its budget to three million dollars .
2441 2519 But of course , the comet movie that opens tomorrow cost seventy-five million .
