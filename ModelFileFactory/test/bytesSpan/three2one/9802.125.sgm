428 609 British and Irish officials went to Belfast to inform Sinn Fein leaders that two recent slayings police blamed on the IRA disqualify the party from a place at the negotiating table .
610 694 But the officials made clear they were acting reluctantly and wanted Sinn Fein back .
695 833 They specified that the suspension will last until March 9 but warned that Sinn Fein could be expelled permanently if the IRA kills again .
834 965 They also agreed to hold back-door communications with Sinn Fein so that it can be heard in the negotiations during the suspension .
966 1202 -LRB- Late Friday , a car bomb exploded near a police station in Moira , 20 miles south of Belfast , causing widespread damage and minor injuries to about a dozen people , police and hospital personnel said , according to news services .
1203 1254 There was no initial claim of responsibility . -RRB-
1255 1324 Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams called the suspension `` disgraceful . ''
1325 1439 `` The process by which this decision was reached lacks any notion of natural justice or fairness , '' Adams said .
1440 1482 But he urged supporters to show restraint .
1483 1642 `` I want to appeal to everyone to stay calm , to channel their anger and their frustration , if they wish to , into calm and disciplined protest , '' he said .
1643 1917 Many people in Northern Ireland fear that any violent street demonstrations or new attacks by the IRA in response to the suspension will effectively end the talks , which aim to end three decades of violence between the province 's Protestant majority and Catholic minority .
1918 2004 Reacting to the decision , several hundred people chanted `` No justice , no peace ! ''
2005 2147 outside police stations in Catholic west Belfast and in Londonderry , Northern Ireland 's second-largest city , the Associated Press reported .
2148 2238 In north Belfast , protesters scuffled with police and soldiers guarding Protestant homes .
2239 2292 Bigger weekend protests are scheduled in both cities .
2293 2449 British and Irish officials said they had no choice but to suspend Sinn Fein once police in Northern Ireland linked the IRA to two killings there last week .
2450 2574 Under the rules of the discussions , political parties may take part only if their paramilitary allies respect a cease-fire .
2575 2745 `` The principles -LRB- of nonviolence -RRB- have been demonstrably dishonored , '' British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Marjorie Mowlam said today in Belfast .
2746 2880 `` Therefore Sinn Fein is no longer entitled to take part in these talks ... We can not have the integrity of the process violated . ''
2881 3045 Sinn Fein filed suit Wednesday in Dublin to try to block the suspension , contending it is separate from the IRA and should not be held accountable for IRA actions .
3046 3111 Sinn Fein withdrew its court action following today 's expulsion .
3112 3290 Britain and Ireland ejected Sinn Fein reluctantly , since any hope for lasting peace hinges on the support of the IRA , the province 's most powerful Catholic paramilitary group .
3291 3461 `` I look forward to their return on March 9 , '' said Irish Foreign Minister David Andrews , who with Mowlam met with Adams and other Sinn Fein leaders in Belfast today .
3462 3646 Meanwhile , reports of another apparently sectarian slaying in Northern Ireland underlined how often the cease-fire is violated and how difficult it is to determine who is responsible .
3647 3753 On Wednesday , a Catholic man was found shot dead in a deserted farmhouse , his arms tied behind his back .
3754 3867 A Protestant paramilitary group that operates in the area , the Loyalist Volunteer Force , denied responsibility .
3868 3943 Sinn Fein 's suspension was intended in part to satisfy Protestant leaders .
3944 4070 But representatives of Protestant parties contended today that Sinn Fein received special treatment even as it was thrown out .
4071 4261 They noted that a small Protestant group , the Ulster Democratic Party , was given no return date when it was ejected last month after its paramilitary ally admitted killing three Catholics .
4262 4375 Britain and Ireland announced today the Ulster Democratic Party will be allowed to return to the talks on Monday .
