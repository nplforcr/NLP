0 450 9802.161 NEWS STORY SOURCE : The Washington Post SECTION : A23 LENGTH : 678 DATE : February 19 , 1998 HEADLINE : Trip to Iraq Last Chance , Annan Says ; Not an ` Easy Mission , ' U.N. Leader Admits BODY_LEN : 676 UNITED NATIONS , Feb. 18 - Having won backing for a diplomatic mission from the five permanent members of the Security Council , U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan said today that his trip to Baghdad was the last chance to head off a war .
451 609 Annan intends to leave Thursday carrying a compromise by the Security Council intended to allow Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to back down while saving face .
610 769 The compromise would have diplomats tag along with U.N. weapons inspectors to the eight presidential palaces that the Iraqi government has declared off-limits .
770 911 Diplomats here said that Iraq was aware of the proposed face-saving compromise on Tuesday when it formally welcomed Annan 's announced visit .
912 1148 But they said there is no indication at this point whether it might be an acceptable cover for Saddam Hussein , allowing him to backtrack on months of provocations that have led the United States to prepare a massive air attack on Iraq .
1149 1439 While acknowledging that `` this obviously is not going to be an easy mission , '' Annan said today that he has been in frequent touch with the Iraqi government and is `` encouraged by the message coming from Baghdad that they are prepared to engage me constructively to find a solution . ''
1440 1597 Annan , a Ghanaian facing by far the greatest diplomatic challenge of his 13 months as secretary general , is due in Baghdad on Friday after a stop in Paris .
1598 1700 He said he will stay in Iraq for no more than two days before returning to brief the Security Council .
1701 1958 Under the proposal , said one senior U.N. diplomat , diplomatic observers `` can stand around '' and provide the Iraqi government with a `` fig leaf '' of international respect for its sovereignty as U.N. inspectors do their job with no time limits imposed .
1959 2087 Baghdad 's most recent offer had been to open the closed sites to inspection for 60 days -- an offer the United States rejected .
2088 2217 American support for Annan 's mission was couched today in language that ranged from carefully supportive to bluntly pessimistic .
2218 2365 White House spokesman Michael McCurry said , `` There 's been no indication from the government of Iraq that would lead anyone to be optimistic . ''
2366 2463 Bill Richardson , the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , was only slightly more encouraging .
2464 2593 He wished Annan `` Godspeed , '' described him as `` very skilled '' and said he had the `` full support '' of President Clinton .
2594 2806 But Richardson insisted that nothing Annan does -- short of coaxing Saddam Hussein into giving U.N. weapons inspectors `` unconditional , unfettered '' access to suspected weapons sites -- will defuse the crisis .
2807 2919 `` If Iraq does not comply , there are going to be some very , very serious consequences , '' Richardson warned .
2920 2996 The United Nations has been down this foggy road before with Saddam Hussein .
2997 3119 In 1991 , then-Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar made an abortive trip to Baghdad trying to head off the Gulf War .
3120 3246 Saddam Hussein kept him waiting an entire day before seeing the U.N. leader and then refused to pull his troops out of Kuwait .
3247 3342 Annan suggested today that he has given considerable thought to his predecessor 's humiliation .
3343 3436 He said that in recent days he has been on the phone to Paris to speak with Perez de Cuellar .
3437 3534 `` I know about his experience and probably will see him on my way through Paris , '' Annan said .
3535 3667 Asked about Annan 's mission , Perez de Cuellar told reporters that he is hoping the secretary general will produce a `` miracle . ''
3668 3891 A senior U.N. diplomat said Annan understands the trip to Baghdad puts him in a vulnerable position that may damage the image of the United Nations , but added that the secretary general believes he has no choice but to go .
3892 4040 `` It 's not going to be good for the United Nations to fail , but it would n't be good for the United Nations to do nothing , '' said the diplomat .
4041 4248 Besides being in the dark about whether Saddam Hussein is prepared to back down , the diplomat said Annan also is unclear about whether the U.S. government regards his Baghdad trip as a meaningless exercise .
4249 4291 `` It is hard to know about the Americans .
4292 4355 They might have already decided to bomb , '' said the diplomat .
4356 4356 .
