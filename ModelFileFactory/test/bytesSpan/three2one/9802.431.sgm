6215 6551 According to Tass and the Interfax news agency , Saddam had agreed to permit inspectors access to the eight sites , all of which are presidential compounds , so long as the team included technicians from of each of the five permanent member states of the U.N. Security Council -- the United States , Russia , China , Britain and France .
6552 6648 The inspections would also have to take place in the company of diplomats from each of the five .

6770 6994 The Iraqi leader put a further condition on the visits : Although the inspectors would be permitted to visit the buildings , they could not inspect the territory surrounding them , according to an account issued by Interfax .
6995 7094 That would fall short of the U.S. and British insistence that the inspectors have unlimited access .
