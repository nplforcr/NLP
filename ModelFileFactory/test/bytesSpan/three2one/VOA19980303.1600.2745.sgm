0 246 VOA19980303 .1600.2745 NEWS STORY While the expansion of the Internet has been a blessing for researchers , students and the just plain curious , the new opportunities mentioned by Mr. Gates are also being used by some rather unsavory characters .
247 365 A new report says there has been a dramatic rise in the growth of hate groups in the United States over the past year .
366 453 And many of them are using the Internet to spread their messages of racial superiority .
454 514 VOA 's Jim Teple has details from our southeast news bureau .
515 664 The Southern Poverty Law Center , a civil rights monitoring group based in Montgomery , Alabama , has long monitored such groups as the Ku Klux Klan .
665 807 More recently it has followed the growth of the militia movement and church groups that preach a message of white supremacy and anti-semitism .
808 999 The new study written by Mark Potach , who edits the Southern Poverty Law Center 's Intelligence Report , warns that such groups grew rapidly last year , mostly by recruiting younger members .
1000 1128 Mr. Potach says the growth is surprising since membership in hate groups usually declines during periods of economic prosperity .
1129 1275 We in fact have seen hate group numbers dropping through the nineties , uh but this year they jumped up uh twenty percent , quite a dramatic rise .
1276 1497 Mark Potach says over four hundred hate groups have been identified and many are becoming increasingly successful at recruiting younger members through the use of Internet web pages and the promotion of racist rock music .
1498 1718 The Internet has certainly helped uh hate mongers to organize and uh to feel that they are part of a larger community , even if uh they are essentially uh , you know , angry people sitting in their bedrooms uh all alone .
1719 1810 Uh , in addition , white power racist music has become uh quite popular in certain sectors .
1811 1908 Uh , there are over fifty thousand CDs a year sold with uh lyrics that are quite uh unbelievable .
1909 2098 Many of these new members are joining chapters of the so called Christian Identity Movement which cites Biblical scripture as a foundation for a belief in white supremacy and anti-semitism .
2099 2185 Mark Potach says such members are also intensely attracted to apocalyptical fantasies .
2186 2280 The approach of the year two thousand has many of these groups in a kind of millennial frenzy .
2281 2494 Uh , uh a - they believe , or at least many of them believe , uh that they are approaching the Battle of Armageddon in which they will be pitted against the uh kind of Satanic forces trying to take over the world .
2495 2672 Mr. Potach notes older , more traditional groups like the Ku Klux Klan are also opening new chapters , thanks in part to their ability to use new technologies like the Internet .
2673 2790 The Federal Bureau of Investigation says it received more than eight thousand reports of hate group crimes last year .
2791 2964 Law enforcement authorities say such reports are likely to increase as police departments are now beginning to more accurately report hate crimes than they have in the past .
