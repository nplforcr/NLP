290 495 yesterday launched a drive to block Senate confirmation of David Satcher as surgeon general , setting the stage for a potentially rancorous fight over his nomination after Congress reconvenes next Tuesday .
496 828 At a news conference sponsored by the conservative journal Human Events , Ashcroft and representatives of the Christian Coalition and the Family Research Council objected in particular to Satcher 's support for President Clinton 's stand opposing passage of legislation to ban what critics describe as `` partial-birth '' abortions .
829 912 `` The nation 's chief medical officer should be above reproach , '' Ashcroft said .
913 971 `` Unfortunately , this is not the case with this nominee .
972 1178 Dr. Satcher joins with the president in support of ` partial birth ' abortion , a position that places him squarely at odds with the professional and ethical judgment of the American Medical Association . ''
1179 1344 But in separate statements yesterday , the AMA and American Academy of Family Physicians reaffirmed their support for Satcher and called for his prompt confirmation .
1345 1579 `` The American Medical Association continues to enthusiastically support Dr. David Satcher ... He will bring a wealth of experience from both the private and public sectors to the office , '' said AMA President-elect Nancy W. Dickey .
1580 1764 The surgeon general 's office `` has been vacant far too long , '' and `` the American public needs a credible voice they can turn to in times of a public health crisis , '' she added .
1765 1946 Satcher , a former president of Meharry Medical College who has served as director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention since 1993 , was nominated last year by Clinton .
1947 2077 His nomination was approved by the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee and he appeared to have broad support in the Senate .
2078 2179 But final Senate action was held up , largely because of conservatives ' abortion-related objections .
2180 2336 While Ashcroft indicated he will keep trying to hold up action on the nomination , the timing is up to Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott -LRB- R-Miss . -RRB-
2337 2466 , who said in a CNN interview Sunday that he intends to seek a vote `` in the first couple of weeks '' after Congress reconvenes .
2467 2570 He would have to consider any `` new information available from Sen. Ashcroft or others , '' Lott said .
2571 2648 `` But I think at some point the responsible thing to do is to call it on up .
2649 2742 Let 's have a debate on his qualifications and his positions and have a vote , '' Lott added .
2743 2839 Lott appeared to be a major focus of the conservatives ' effort to derail Satcher 's nomination .
2840 3105 Randy Tate , executive director of the Christian Coalition , noted that Lott said Congress is the proper arena for action on abortion in a letter to the Republican National Committee before it voted last weekend against penalizing GOP candidates who oppose the ban .
3106 3242 So Lott should `` exercise leadership in the U.S. Senate and defend these innocent children by defeating this nomination , '' Tate said .
3243 3552 Meanwhile , on another contentious nomination , the Justice Department disagreed with two influential senators who contend that Bill Lann Lee , whose nomination as assistant attorney general for civil rights was stalled in the Senate last year , can not serve in an acting capacity in the job beyond 120 days .
3553 3662 In letters to Senate Judiciary Committee Orrin G. Hatch -LRB- R-Utah -RRB- and Sen. Robert C. Byrd -LRB- D-W .
3663 3864 Va. -RRB- , Assistant Attorney General Andrew Fois said it has `` long been the position '' of the Justice Department that it does not fall under the 120-day limitation prescribed by the Vacancies Act .
3865 3985 In any case , the limitation would no longer apply when Clinton renominates Lee , as he has said he will do , Fois said .
3986 4037 There was no immediate response from Hatch or Byrd .
4038 4038 .
