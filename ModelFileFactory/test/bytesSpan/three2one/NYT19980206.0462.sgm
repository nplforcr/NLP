376 440 In the distant era known as Watergate , it was Carson who ruled .
441 646 Such was his cultural authority _ and restrained exercise of it _ that his belated inclusion of White House scandals in his `` Tonight '' show monologue was the certain sign that Richard Nixon was through .
647 1017 But Carson is retired now , and there 's no stronger indication of how much the world has changed than this week 's news from the Center for Media and Public Affairs : There have been more Leno and Letterman gags about President Clinton 's sex life , an average of 16 per show per night , than on any other topic in the center 's 10-year history of monologue monitoring .
1018 1188 They 're so tasteless that , as the non-late-night comedy writer Larry Gelbart puts it , `` It could n't have been this bad in the last 10 minutes of the Roman Empire . ''
1189 1231 And what difference has all the gags made ?
1232 1345 The raunchier they are _ and the raunchier the news that inspires them _ the higher Bill Clinton 's poll numbers .
1346 1432 Carson is n't the only essential compass we 've lost on the waves of dizzying scandal .
1433 1579 Sam Ervin , the trust-inspiring chairman of the Watergate hearings , is dead , and Fred Thompson , let alone Al D'Amato , proved no reincarnation .
1580 1706 Howard Baker , the senator who demanded what the president knew and when he knew it , is now a shill for the tobacco industry .
1707 1820 Instead of the apolitical , no-nonsense Watergate Judge Sirica , we have the partisan , Malibu-bound Judge Starr .
1821 2028 For all the hand-wringing about how Clinton 's alleged deeds have supposedly debased the values , ethics and morals of the nation , who in American public life has the standing to lead us to judgment of him ?
2029 2054 Not the celebrity clergy .
2055 2254 Billy Graham , who never met an embattled president to whom he did not grant absolution -LRB- Richard Nixon included -RRB- , turned up on Thursday to embrace Clinton at the National Prayer Breakfast .
2255 2401 Jesse Jackson is on the White House TV spin team , providing reassuring bulletins from phone chats he 's had with the first daughter in Palo Alto .
2402 2488 Jerry Falwell is a peddler of crazy , hateful videos accusing the president of murder .
2489 2689 That oily paragon of big money and hypocritical political cynicism , Pat Robertson , has so little credibility that you have to wonder if his campaign to save Karla Faye Tucker hastened her execution .
2690 2700 The press ?
2701 2868 The many retracted Oralgate stories have taken their toll ; yesterday 's Pew poll found that 63 percent of the public dismisses news reports as `` often inaccurate . ''
2869 3213 The fire-and-brimstone broadcast preachers on Presidential morality include the past-gate scoundrels G. Gordon Liddy and Oliver North _ as well as George Will , whose own elastic ethics allowed him to coach Ronald Reagan for a 1980 debate while keeping his role a secret from ABC News viewers to whom he then effused over Reagan 's performance .
3214 3226 Politicians ?
3227 3275 Very few have been heard from , and we know why .
3276 3511 Newt Gingrich , third in line for the presidency , was branded with the scarlet A by the right-leaning New York Post three years ago , when it gave its front-page imprimatur to allegations that he `` made whoopee '' on his office desk .
3512 3689 Phil Gramm , who chastises Clinton for having `` no bearings , '' was revealed in his '96 Presidential campaign to have invested in a soft-core movie called `` Beauty Queens . ''
3690 3967 Some of the sternest Capitol Hill attacks on Clinton 's `` moral fiber '' have come from none other than Helen Chenoweth , the Idaho congresswoman who publicly fed false militia-spawned rumors of malevolent government helicopters in the months before the Oklahoma City bombing .
3968 4207 No wonder Ralph Reed has now advised his fellow Republicans to find `` someone who is beyond reproach personally '' to take on the president _ a casting call that has had few takers beyond the self-appointed national scold William Bennett .
4208 4369 Nor have Democrats done any better : they 've found no above-the-fray leader who can either defend or disown Clinton from an impartial , nonpartisan moral plane .
4370 4407 So far only Al Gore has even applied .
4408 4632 Thus does the fate of this White House hang , incredibly enough , on the American people , who so far seem to be reserving judgment and ignoring the pronouncements of press , clergy , politicians and late-night comics alike .
4633 4676 Moral fiber aside , democracy is on a roll .
