72 169 The Middle East peace talks in London are going into overtime , but no one is predicting victory .
170 344 Secretary of state Madeline Albright , Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yassir Arafat have all agreed to spend tonight in the British capital .
345 496 They will continue to discuss a US proposal for Israel to hand over more occupied land to the Palestinians in exchange for tougher security guarantees .
497 567 The World 's Allen Dow has been monitoring the negotiations in London .
568 655 Allen , the peace process , as you know , has been deadlocked for more than a year now .
656 745 Is there any sign that these talks in London could achieve the uh necessary breakthrough ?
746 793 Well , it 's anybody 's guess eh at the moment .
794 831 The talks uh went ahead all day long .
832 933 They uh , in fact , they talked longer than they thought they would , the first round of talks today .
934 1017 Um , secretary of state Albright met with the Israeli leader for nearly five hours .
1018 1061 Um , that was longer than anybody expected .
1062 1150 She met with uh the leader of the Palestinians , Yassir Arafat for about ninety minutes .
1151 1484 But afterwards , you know , nobody was very optimistic , including the , uh , h - her spokesman , James Rubin who said to reporters a little bit later on that , ah , that the optimism was not high based on the evidence that uh has been seen so far , but they 're going to continue to work at it , th - ah , meaning the United States .
1485 1514 And what else are we hearing ?
1515 1618 What have the parties themselves been saying so far , if anything , about what 's been happening today ?
1619 1702 Well , the parties uh themselves are , are basically finger pointing at each other .
1703 1875 The Is - the Israeli leader , Benjamin Netanyahu came out and said that um , after tha - those five hours of negotiations that that he thought that progress was being made .
1876 2150 But the Palestinians have said all along that they think this is just a stalling tactic , that in fact , uh the Israeli leader is is just trying to buy some time here and make it look like he 's negotiating when , in fact , there are no ah real solid proposals on the table .
2151 2333 And the way these talks are happening , uh no face-to-face talks apparently right now , the different parties , Yassir Arafat and Benjamin Netanyahu are actually in different hotels .
2334 2348 That 's right .
2349 2472 the - Madeleine Albright has been sort of shuttling back and forth uh through the day and the night speaking to both sides .
2473 2515 Um , the two sides will not meet together .
2516 2590 Uh , they may at some point , but right now that 's just not in the cards .
2591 2680 The US proposal is for Israel to withdraw from another thirteen percent of the West Bank .
2681 2746 Uh wh - why is it that uh Benjamin Netanyahu can not accept that ?
2747 2900 Well , he says that ah Isr - i - i - it 's a question of security and that Israel ah really ca n't give up anymore than nine percent uh of the west bank .
2901 3054 If you look on a map , Tel Aviv - v , the capital , is very close to uh , to uh the west bank , which , of course , is is the biggest occupied territory .
3055 3180 They say to give up any more more of that , it would uh , it would place t - the the capital in jeopardy from further attack .
3181 3241 And is there anything new on the table in these talks today ?
3242 3305 At the moment i - it 's not clear exactly what is on the table .
3306 3344 These talks are being held in private .
3345 3388 Nobody 's letting us know what is going on .
3389 3484 But um e - everybody seems to be pessimistic right now that uh things are not looking too good .
3485 3535 The World 's Allen Dow speaking to us from London .
3536 3561 Thanks very much , Allen .
3562 3572 Thank you .
3573 3573 .
