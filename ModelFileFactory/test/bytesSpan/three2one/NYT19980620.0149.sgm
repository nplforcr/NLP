Times News Service dLR ; dQC ; dQL ; MOSCOW _ The warmth and lingering daylight of a Moscow summer could make even the harshest periods of Soviet rule seem less demented .
461 683 The appearance of flowers and fresh fruits and vegetables in barren markets temporarily lifted the city 's spirits , creating the illusion that this was just another European capital marking time until the August holidays .
684 716 Now it is no longer an illusion .
717 785 Moscow may not be Paris or Rome , but it is no longer a world apart .
786 897 The differences of dress , demeanor and politics that made Moscow so distinctively depressing have melted away .
898 1086 From its monumental traffic jams to its supermarkets , boutiques and elegant restaurants , Moscow is a big , bustling , brash metropolis exploding with energy and entrepreneurial activity .
1087 1315 To see the city again after an absence of three years , and to compare it to the Soviet citadel of 10 years ago where I worked as a correspondent , is to appreciate anew how far Russia has traveled since the demise of Communism .
1316 1586 The economy is shaky , corruption is ubiquitous and the power of the wealthiest bankers and businessmen remains largely unchecked , but these and other deformities should not overshadow the political and economic changes that have transformed Russia in just a few years .
1587 1787 Almost as swiftly as the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution sealed Russia in hermetic isolation , the arrival of democracy and capitalism have set it free and tied it to the West , culturally and economically .
1788 1868 Moscow is the epicenter of change , and the locus of wealth , in the new Russia .
1869 2037 It will be some time before the rest of the country , including St. Petersburg , comes anywhere close to matching the standard of living now enjoyed by many Muscovites .
2038 2159 One of the best seats for observing the new Russia is on the terrace outside the cavernous McDonald 's at Pushkin Square .
2160 2301 Though the novelty of Big Macs has faded , the restaurant still has cachet with Russians and serves as a mecca for affluent young Muscovites .
2302 2379 They arrive in Jeep Cherokees and Toyota Land Cruisers , cell phones in hand .
2380 2553 The men are dressed nattily in light-weight pleated trousers , colorful sport shirts and tasseled loafers , the women in short skirts , tight tops and stylish Italian shoes .
2554 2629 The scene seems almost unimaginable to someone who lived here a decade ago .
2630 2778 The McDonald 's also attracts working-class customers who have become indistinguishable in appearance from their counterparts in London or New York .
2779 2904 The nondescript Soviet wardrobe has almost entirely vanished , replaced by jeans , colorful outfits and Nike or Reebok shoes .
2905 2946 Even eyeglasses and sunglasses are sleek .
2947 3088 After decades of enforced conformity in everything from clothing to politics , Russians have seized the chance to assert their individuality .
3089 3192 Across from the McDonald 's is a small plaza that is part of the boulevard that circles central Moscow .
3193 3424 Once a cheerless place with a few scruffy benches and an expanse of dirt , it is now the site of a leafy beer garden where people congregate after work , engaging in easy conversation as the daylight stretches far into the evening .
3425 3491 The talk is of business and politics , romance and vacation plans .
3492 3583 The fear that once permeated Moscow and made it so inhospitable to such gatherings is gone .
3584 3687 The press is full of lively debate and invective , the television news a cascade of irreverent reports .
3688 3808 Even more remarkable is the Internet , where information of all kinds is available about the government and the economy .
3809 3987 Where implacable customs agents once enforced Soviet censorship at Sheremetyevo airport , there is now an unobstructed `` green channel '' for passengers with nothing to declare .
3988 4025 The new Russia is an unfinished work .
4026 4157 It is a land that favors the young and those unbroken by Communism and has little patience or compassion for those unable to adapt .
4158 4233 But Moscow , at least , is increasingly a city where people can enjoy life .
4234 4281 Considering its history , that is no mean feat .
