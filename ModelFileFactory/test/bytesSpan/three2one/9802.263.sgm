0 422 9802.263 NEWS STORY SOURCE : The Washington Post SECTION : A29 LENGTH : 739 DATE : February 12 , 1998 HEADLINE : Chinese Vice Premier Pushing Controversial Plan to Streamline Government BODY_LEN : 675 BEIJING , Feb. 11 - Vice Premier Zhu Rongji is pushing a controversial plan to streamline China 's bloated government bureaucracy that would take effect just after next month 's session of the National People 's Congress .
423 482 Zhu wants to merge several ministries whose duties overlap .
483 562 Sources suggest 10 or more ministries could be merged with others or abolished .
563 756 In addition , Zhu is planning to take ministries overseeing industries and convert them into state-owned companies that would be expected to run on a more efficient , economically viable basis .
757 953 `` At present , governmental agencies manage a lot of things they should n't manage and ca n't manage well , '' said Zhang Xiuxue , vice president of the Chinese National School of Administration .
954 1031 `` The expansion of government agencies has hindered economic development . ''
1032 1107 But Zhang said the proposed government overhaul `` is still very difficult .
1108 1178 Some people do n't want to give up the authority they already have . ''
1179 1337 `` Few people oppose Zhu 's idea for streamlining government , '' said a government official , `` except when it comes to their own ministry or department . ''
1338 1509 Despite widespread opposition to the plan from people who would lose status , authority or even their jobs , most analysts said Zhu will , for the most part , get his way .
1510 1685 The powerful vice premier , who has been the government 's chief economic policymaker , is widely expected to become China 's new premier during the Party Congress next month .
1686 1900 With the rest of Asia in the throes of economic crisis , few Chinese leaders would want to undermine the authority of the person who is considered most responsible for helping China avoid the fate of its neighbors .
1901 2154 In what appeared to be an effort to divert some flak away from Zhu , Hu Jintao , another member of the Communist Party 's all-powerful seven-man Standing Committee , is leading the working committee nominally in charge of devising the streamlining plan .
2155 2334 In the past , many government departments were created to serve as power bases for political groups within the ruling Communist Party and as rewards for long-serving party cadres .
2335 2481 There are 40 ministries under the State Council , China 's cabinet , plus eight institutions , 13 administrations and bureaus , and seven offices .
2482 2555 Now , Zhu is proposing to merge bodies that duplicate each other 's work .
2556 2684 For example , the State Commission for Economic Restructuring might merge with the State Council 's Development Research Center .
2685 2751 The Ministry of Labor and the Ministry of Personnel could combine .
2752 2839 The Ministry of Communications could join the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications .
2840 2957 The Ministry of Culture and Ministry of Radio , Film and Television also have been tapped for possible consolidation .
2958 3054 The ministries dealing with particular industries are likely to become state-owned corporations .
3055 3135 At the top of that list is the Ministry of the Chemical Industry , sources said .
3136 3257 Other possibilities are the ministries for railways , the electronics industry , machine-building plants and coal mining .
3258 3319 Most of these ministries are swollen with unneeded employees .
3320 3409 Conversion to state-owned corporations is no guarantee of improved performance , however .
3410 3575 The petroleum ministry was converted to the Chinese National Petroleum Corp. several years ago , but it still is struggling to trim its staff and improve efficiency .
3576 3796 The corporation employs a staggering 1.51 million people in a wide range of tasks , from running universities to building roads , from drilling wells to making watches , from maintaining pipelines to operating hospitals .
3797 3906 On Sunday , the corporation said it would launch a new set of reforms , including laying off 250,000 workers .
3907 4065 It said it also would seek to delegate managerial responsibility to subsidiaries and list certain parts of its business on domestic and international markets .
4066 4137 The airline and railway industries also have announced massive layoffs .
4138 4336 The current drive to streamline government is not the first time Zhu has taken on entrenched interests within China 's system of governing , but in the past they were mostly at the provincial level .
4337 4561 As vice premier and president of the People 's Bank of China in 1995 , Zhu clamped down on the free flow of credit from provincial branches of the bank to projects and state-owned enterprises favored by provincial officials .
4562 4679 He also overhauled tax revenue sharing to stop the slide in the central government 's share of national tax revenues .
