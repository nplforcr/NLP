Times News Service dLR ; dQC ; dQL ; If you are willing to pay a premium up front and put up with plenty of annoyance in exchange for bargain prices on spoken-word programming , the digital world has a gadget for you .
599 709 The Audible Player is a pocket-sized 3.5-ounce plastic device shaped like a child 's mitten without the thumb .
710 841 It costs about $ 200 and is designed to play audio books and other programs that you buy and download in digital form from the Web .
842 1150 In other words , it is a lot like a standard Walkman-style cassette or CD player , except that the Walkman is cheaper , has high enough fidelity for music as well as words , takes just seconds to swap material , plays in stereo , runs quite awhile on standard batteries and does not require Windows 95 or NT .
1151 1213 But the Audible Player weighs less and has fewer moving parts .
1214 1487 The Audible Player , made by Audible Inc. of Wayne , N.J. , comes with headphones , a carrying pouch , an adapter that slips into a standard cassette player and a cradle , which must be connected to AC power and a serial port to transfer data from a computer to the device .
1488 1746 An accompanying CD-ROM supplies the requisite plumbing software as well as several hours of audio programming , including poetry by Robert Frost , humor by Dave Barry and selections from Frank Herbert 's `` Dune , '' The Harvard Business Review and Car Talk .
1747 1854 Those trial programs are also available free at www.audible.com in exchange for information about yourself .
1855 2039 You do not need the stand-alone player to listen to this or any of Audible 's other programming ; player software that works on Windows 95 and NT computers is free for the downloading .
2040 2260 The site offers more than 4,000 programs , from Sue Grafton 's `` A is for Alibi '' to Zora Neal Hurston 's stories , at prices as low as 95 cents for some short subjects and as much as $ 12.95 for a few business titles .
2261 2492 Because Audible delivers digital bits rather than a physical package , Frank McCourt 's 4 -LCB- - hour abridg-ment of `` Angela 's Ashes '' costs just $ 8.95 ; the same reading on CD-ROM from Amazon.com goes for $ 21 plus shipping .
2493 2631 An unabridged version of George Orwell 's `` Animal Farm '' costs $ 6.95 from Audible ; at Amazon , the cassette is $ 11.87 plus shipping .
2632 2668 These bargains have their drawbacks .
2669 2934 Audio clips played directly on my 90 megahertz Pentium machine stammered to the point of uselessness whenever other programs were doing anything of consequence ; things worked without a hitch on a 400 megahertz machine , so the cutoff point presumably lies between .
2935 3114 Even at its best , though , Audible 's compression scheme reduces audio quality to the point where some `` programs with substantial musical portions are currently unavailable . ''
3115 3284 Buying programs over the Web is simple enough , but downloading can easily take half an hour for a 4-megabyte , 2-hour program , which is as much as the player can hold .
3285 3309 And the site needs work .
3310 3507 When I tried downloading the 2-hour April 3 edition of National Public Radio 's `` Talk of the Nation Science Friday '' for $ 2.95 , the excerpt I received was only an hour long and the wrong show .
3508 3573 Programs in that series are available free at NPR 's site anyhow .
3574 3676 The player has a volume knob plus five buttons that serve multiple functions and take getting used to .
3677 3826 The buttons let you jump from section to section of a program , bookmark favorite passages and skip forward or backward seconds or minutes at a time .
3827 3965 But you can not sample the audio at fast forward , and aside from an LED that flashes puzzling colored patterns , all feedback is audible .
3966 4101 That means you can not really tell where you are in a program , and you can not tell by looking what programs are stored in the device .
4102 4149 The unit cries out for an alphanumeric display .
4150 4311 For cars and other places where more than one person might want to listen , the player can transmit an FM radio signal that can be picked up by a standard radio .
4312 4400 First you tune the radio to an unused channel , which is not always easy in urban areas .
4401 4589 Then you set the player to generate a steady tone , slowly turn an unmarked dial on the back until you hear the tone through the radio speakers , and switch to programming from the device .
4590 4720 Getting all that to work is neither easy nor worth the bother , because the signal tends to break up at the slightest provocation .
4721 4783 I finally gave up and switched to the cassette-player adapter .
4784 4852 It did not deliver particularly good sound , but at least it worked .
4853 5027 Air travelers take note : According to the manual , the player 's FM radiation makes it a potential navigational hazard if it is turned on while the headphones are unplugged .
5028 5166 Because the unit lacks removable memory and can hold only about two hours of content , you must return it to the cradle often for refills .
5167 5299 Uploads from the computer take about 10 minutes and are usually smart enough to avoid erasing what you have not listened to already .
5300 5350 But recharging the battery takes 60 to 90 minutes .
5351 5462 A full charge is supposed to last at least three hours , but not necessarily long enough for two full programs .
5463 5559 An extra battery costs $ 25 and can be recharged separately in a well on the back of the cradle .
5560 5690 The device can also accept a downloadable format called Mobile RealAudio , not to be confused with the popular standard RealAudio .
5691 5797 It may conceivably catch on , but only one site , www.dailybriefing.com , offers programming that uses it .
5798 5833 The player is hardly a work of art .
5834 5975 The volume control on the one I tried moved jerkily , and the case nearly came apart when I inadvertently inserted the battery the wrong way .
5976 6147 The button on the cradle does not match the one that appears in on-screen instructional messages , and tends to make the cradle slide across the desk whenever you push it .
6148 6251 Though there is a 30-day unconditional refund policy , the warranty against defects lasts just 90 days .
6252 6471 The Internet will undoubtedly be a major conduit for audio programming in the coming years , and the Audible Player is probably worthy of a minor footnote in the annals of Internet commerce despite its many limitations .
6472 6505 But the next Walkman this is not .
