0 138 VOA19980624 .1800.1997 NEWS STORY China 's human rights record has dominated much of the debate about Mr. Clinton 's trip in recent weeks .
139 199 Especially his agreement to be welcomed in Tiananmen Square .
200 254 That 's the site of the nineteen eighty-nine massacre .
255 332 And also about Mr. Clinton 's refusal to meet with dissidents while in China .
333 459 But there 's also a lot of controversy about the apparent provision of missile technology to China by Clinton campaign donors .
460 579 VOA 's Roger Wilkison reports from Beijing , it frames an ongoing debate over America 's military relations with China .
580 844 A debate between hawks and doves among defense strategists and theoreticians in both countries is taking place at the same time as Beijing and Washington step up military exchanges , and identify common interests , such as avoiding tension on the Korean peninsula .
845 1081 Tensions over Taiwan in nineteen ninety-five and nineteen ninety-six , when the United States deployed aircraft carriers in the area , after China launched missiles near the island , have also prompted a search for better understanding .
1082 1346 Paul Beaver , an analyst with the respected Jane 's Defense Publications in London , thinks that deployment caused the Chinese military to think twice about using force to capture the island they regard as a renegade province , at least for the foreseeable future .
1347 1490 I think that the , uh , the Chinese believe , then , that uh the Americans have the capability of , uh , rushing aircraft carriers to the area .
1491 1570 They did n't believe that they would actually have the political will to do it .
1571 1686 It made them reexamine , for example , any plans they may have had for causing a , uh , a naval blockade of Taiwan .
1687 1885 But US defense analysts say Chinese military studies continue to portray the United States as a superpower in decline , with a gradually eroding commitment to defend Taiwan against a Chinese attack .
1886 2019 The analysts say those studies also conclude that US high tech military capabilities are vulnerable to attack by electronic sabotage .
2020 2124 But the analysts say that essays by senior Chinese officers suggest their views are medium to long term .
2125 2199 And that they see America 's decline coming two or three decades from now .
2200 2324 Mr. Beaver says Chinese military thinkers are divided on whether or not they see the Americans as rivals in the years ahead .
2325 2412 The Chinese , I think , are probably split on how they see the Americans in the future .
2413 2566 There is a party which would look upon the Americans as being a diminishing , a , a , a diminishing presence in , in , Asia , uh , in , two decades time .
2567 2734 Uh , there is perhaps there majority who believe , and I think as I believe , that the United States is committed to Asia probably more than it 's committed to Europe .
2735 2836 Mr. Beaver says that without an American presence , there would be a lack of stability in the region .
2837 2900 He says that if China tries to fill the vacuum , so will Japan .
2901 3069 China expert David Shambaugh , a professor at George Washington University , says that even today , it is difficult to know just what the Chinese military are thinking .
3070 3129 But he suggests they still may be misreading US intentions .
3130 3195 I do n't think the Chinese underestimate American military power .
3196 3282 I think they do underestimate American will , uh , to use force in certain situations .
3283 3483 Singapore 's Straits Times newspaper recently quoted an unnamed Chinese commander as saying his country is confident in its ability to seize Taiwan as soon as the United States fades from the picture .
3484 3639 But he is also quoted as saying a decline in Washington 's support for Taiwan will eventually force the island into peaceful negotiations on reunification .
3640 3773 According to China scholar Michael Ochsenberg of Stanford University , Taiwan is the most serious problem in Sino-American relations .
3774 3873 I do think there is a danger that some Chinese may underestimate American will on the Taiwan issue .
3874 3976 The deep sense of obligation that the American people feel toward the twenty million people on Taiwan .
3977 4100 And , of course , the legal obligation that any Administration has toward Taiwan , as a result of the Taiwan Relations Act .
4101 4289 That nineteen seventy-nine law requires the US government to come to Taiwan 's aide in case it is attacked , and also allows Washington to supply so-called defensive weapons to the island .
4290 4386 US Chinese agreements call for the gradual reduction and eventual elimination of such transfers .
4387 4519 And China says it will press President Clinton to publicly promise to live up to those accords , during his upcoming visit to China .
4520 4656 US diplomats say Washington has privately told both sides that it will not help Taiwan if the island declares its outright independence .
4657 4727 But that it will stand by Taipei if China attacks without provocation .
