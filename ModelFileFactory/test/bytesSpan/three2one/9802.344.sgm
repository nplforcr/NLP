's chairman yesterday rescinded the dismissals of four vice presidents who were unexpectedly fired Monday after an abortive bid to purchase a BTG division , company sources said .
386 432 The executives were allowed to resign instead .
433 569 Ed Bersoff , the Fairfax company 's chief executive , announced the decision in a company-wide electronic message sent out after 5 p.m. .
570 756 The e-mail message , a copy of which was obtained by The Washington Post , said the four vice presidents have `` chosen to resign effective February 6 , 1998 , to pursue other interests .
757 857 I regret any disruptions that may have been caused to these individuals or others in the company . ''
858 945 The e-mail was part of a settlement agreement between BTG and the four vice presidents .
946 1004 Neither party would discuss the details of the settlement .
1005 1227 The vice presidents -- Scott Reynolds , Paul Collins , Steve Schlosser and Brian Nightingale -- had joined with another company vice president to make a $ 28 million cash bid for the company 's technology systems division .
1228 1485 BTG had previously agreed to sell the division to a fierce rival , Chantilly-based Government Technology Services Inc. , for about $ 23 million in cash and stock , but the five BTG executives never appeared to have lined up viable financing for their offer .
1486 1547 BTG expects to close the deal with GTSI in the next few days .
1548 1680 The division being sold is a fast-growing but marginally profitable unit that filled large computer orders from government agencies .
1681 1773 On Monday morning at 11:30 , Bersoff fired the four vice presidents at an impromptu meeting .
1774 1976 Four lower-level staffers who worked closely with the executives also were fired later that day ; Bersoff rescinded those terminations too , according to the e-mail company employees received yesterday .
1977 2077 Steve Baldwin , the fifth BTG vice president involved in the management bid , resigned Monday night .
2078 2257 Baldwin , the most senior official within the management group , said yesterday he has a number of issues with BTG left to be resolved `` that I am assessing as I move forward . ''
2258 2415 Bersoff leveled several allegations against the vice presidents as he fired them Monday , but no one present at the meeting would discuss them on the record .
2416 2704 Later Monday , however , Bersoff sent out a company-wide e-mail in which he said the four vice presidents had been fired `` with cause '' and that they had engaged in activities `` designed to disrupt BTG 's operation and to put the job of all the technology systems employees at risk . ''
2705 2814 The vice presidents vehemently denied any wrongdoing , and spent much of the week meeting with their lawyers .
2815 3115 `` We are pleased on behalf of the terminated officers and employees to have achieved the recision of the termination for cause , '' said Jack McKay , an attorney at the Washington office of Shaw , Pittman , Potts d Trowbridge who is representing eight of the nine BTG employees who left the company .
3116 3195 `` My clients are very satisfied with the e-mail that was distributed today . ''
3196 3418 Bersoff , who was reached in Hawaii , where he is attending a conference , would not comment on the firings or yesterday 's e-mail beyond saying , `` The parties have reached an amicable resolution of their differences . ''
