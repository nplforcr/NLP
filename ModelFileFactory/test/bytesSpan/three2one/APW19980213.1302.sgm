REID dQC ; dUR ; Associated Press Writer dQC ; UNITED NATIONS -LRB- AP -RRB- _ Alarmed over new violence in Sierra Leone , the Security Council appealed Friday to the Nigerian-led African intervention force to allow speedy delivery of humanitarian aid now that that its troops have captured the West African nation 's capital .
603 793 The Nigerian-led force launched an attack last week to unseat the military junta and restore the country 's elected president , Ahmed Tejan Kabbah , who was ousted last May in a bloody coup .
794 889 Nigerian-led troops captured large parts of the center of the capital , Freetown , on Thursday .
890 937 Civilians reportedly celebrated in the streets .
938 1015 The events in Sierra Leone were deeply embarrassing to the council , however .
1016 1122 Although the 15 members had called for Kabbah 's restoration , they had never authorized the use of force .
1123 1254 Instead , the council had endorsed an agreement reached last year for a peaceful restoration of the elected government by April 22 .
1255 1456 Foreign ministers of the West African countries involved in the peacekeeping force had visited U.N. headquarters last week but gave no indication they were about to launch a bid to overthrow the junta .
1457 1703 `` The Security Council expressed its concern over the very unstable situation in parts of the country and over the heavy civilian losses which have been reported , '' council President Denis Dangue Rewaka of Gabon told reporters after a meeting .
1704 1808 `` The Security Council has emphasized that international humanitarian law must be upheld , '' he added .
1809 1998 `` The Security Council called for the humanitarian assistance to be activated immediately , including cross-border operations , and for full , unrestricted access to the people in need . ''
1999 2126 Dangue Rewaka also said the council urged protection of international aid workers and steps to return the country to stability .
2127 2279 It urged the Nigerian-led force `` to cooperate fully '' with the United Nations `` with the view of rapid evaluation of the situation on the ground . ''
2280 2437 Dangue Rewaka refused to say whether the council felt embarrassed by the failure of West African foreign ministers to notify them in advance of the campaign .
2438 2538 But he noted that the council had never authorized the West Africans to use force to oust the junta .
2539 2612 He acknowledged that the council was `` concerned by the use of force . ''
2613 2749 During the meeting , the U.N. humanitarian coordinator , Sergio de Mello , said about 250,000 people had been displaced by the fighting .
2750 2861 De Mello said the situation was `` dramatic , not only in the area of Freetown '' but elsewhere in the country .
2862 2974 The West African force intervened in Sierra Leone soon after the junta led by Maj. Johnny Koroma toppled Kabbah .
2975 3158 After bombarding Freetown in a failed attempt to drive the junta from power , the force blockaded Freetown 's port to prevent food , fuel and other necessities from reaching the city .
3159 3369 Despite international criticism of its human-rights record , Nigeria _ apparently trying to improve its image and its clout in the region _ has become a self-appointed protector of democracy in parts of Africa .
