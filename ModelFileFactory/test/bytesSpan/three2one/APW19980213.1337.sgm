504 712 While there is no danger of reviving the Cold War rivalry that dominated the world for more than 45 years , the diplomatic honeymoon that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 is coming to an end .
713 845 Both Moscow and Washington value good relations , but there are likely to be more and more disagreements as Russia goes its own way .
846 971 Russia 's opposition to the use of force in Iraq is the latest in a series of foreign policy disputes with the United States .
972 1109 Moscow bitterly opposes NATO expansion in east Europe , and Parliament has blocked the START II missile-reduction treaty with Washington .
1110 1213 Moscow also is building links with China , saying the world must not be dominated by the United States .
1214 1345 President Boris Yeltsin and other top Russian officials have unleashed a barrage of warnings on U.S. military strikes against Iraq .
1346 1536 Yeltsin said last week a U.S. attack could lead to world war and his defense minister , Igor Sergeyev , publicly warned U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen in Moscow against attacking Iraq .
1537 1589 At the heart of Russia 's opposition are two issues .
1590 1635 On one level , the issue is mostly pragmatic .
1636 1761 Iraq , an old Soviet client state , owes Moscow billions of dollars for weapons that ca n't be paid until U.N. sanctions end .
1762 1887 Russia , its economy in chaos , desperately needs the cash and also hopes for big new contracts with Iraq when sanctions end .
1888 1968 The second issue , emotive and unpredictable , is Russia 's status in the world .
1969 2048 Many Russians yearn for the days when Moscow was the world 's other superpower .
2049 2189 The fact that Russia has lost much of its power makes the need to play a major global role all the more pressing for many Russian officials .
2190 2288 And envy of its old rival , the United States , is rising as Russia 's power continues to decline .
2289 2373 Russian officials dismiss suggestions they would aid Iraq against the United States .
2374 2503 Moscow backs United Nations ' efforts to strip Iraq of weapons of mass production , but says only a diplomatic solution can work .
2504 2700 Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov , who formed close ties in the Middle East as a Soviet diplomat , has pushed for a Moscow-backed solution on Iraq to help restore Russian influence in the region .
2701 2809 The Russian government has neither the desire or power to risk a major confrontation with the United States .
2810 2894 Yeltsin considers good relations with Washington a foundation of his foreign policy .
2895 3031 But the Russian government and many politicians will be stridently critical of the United States if they believe they are being ignored .
3032 3150 And Russian nationalists will use resentment of American power to boost their calls to revive Russia as a great power .
3151 3318 Anti-American resentment has increased as the United States has tried to influence Russian policy through economic leverage _ particularly in the hard-line parliament .
3319 3418 Some American officials concede that Washington should be more careful about Russian sensibilities .
3419 3519 Moscow should be courted as an ally , they say , lending support to democratic government in Russia .
3520 3733 `` I think it does reflect a sense here of resentment of being ordered around , which in some cases I think our government has done in a way that is not productive , '' U.S. Ambassador James Collins said recently .
