532 697 Scott Ritter led his team on a 10-hour tour of three suspected weapons sites classified as `` sensitive '' by the Iraqi authorities , U.N. spokesman Alan Dacey said .
698 832 `` All sites were inspected to the satisfaction of the inspection team and with full cooperation of Iraqi authorities , '' Dacey said .
833 963 At least one of the sensitive sites was a barracks of the elite Republican Guard , a well-placed source told The Associated Press .
964 1034 Previously the Iraqis have resisted attempts to inspect such quarters .
1035 1183 The U.N. Security Council has charged the inspectors with verifying that Iraq has destroyed its long-range missiles and weapons of mass destruction .
1184 1363 It was the first time that Ritter , who arrived Thursday with some 50 inspectors for a tour likely to last over a week , had been allowed to carry out an inspection since Jan. 13 .
1364 1487 Then the Baghdad government stopped providing Ritter 's team with escorts , making it impossible for him to enter any site .
1488 1601 Iraq alleged Ritter was an American spy whose team had a disproportionately high number of Americans and Britons .
1602 1852 The official Iraqi News Agency , which gives the daily tally of inspections , did not mention Ritter by name , but said Friday that team no. 225 _ which Ritter heads _ made surprise visits to a number of sites and was assisted by aerial surveillance .
1853 1944 Five other U.N. inspection teams visited a total of nine other sites , the agency reported .
1945 2145 An Iraqi official , speaking on customary condition of anonymity , said Ritter would not try to visit any of the eight presidential sites that Baghdad had placed off-limits to U.N. weapons inspectors .
2146 2369 The official said these sites could only be visited by a special team of U.N. monitors and diplomats as laid down by the Feb. 23 accord signed by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz .
2370 2544 Ritter 's return is seen as something of a test of that agreement , under which Iraq agreed to give inspectors full access to eight of Saddam Hussein 's presidential palaces .
2545 2773 The United States had moved additional troops and a naval armada into the Gulf and said it would strike Iraq unless it gave the U.N. arms inspectors unfettered access to all potential weapons sites , including Saddam 's palaces .
2774 2860 Iraq had argued the presidential sites should be off limits as symbols of sovereignty .
2861 3034 A Pentagon spokesman said Thursday that the 38,000 U.S. troops in the Gulf will remain until Iraq complies with the U.N. Security Council agreement over weapons inspections .
3035 3149 `` We are going to maintain our forces in the region for the foreseeable future , '' said spokesman Kenneth Bacon .
3150 3315 The U.N.-Iraq accord was worked out by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan , who appointed a retired Indian diplomat on Thursday as his special representative to Iraq .
3316 3462 Prakash Shah , 58 , a former Indian ambassador to the United Nations , is part of an effort by Annan to expand contacts with the Iraqi leadership .
3463 3559 Palace inspections are not expected to start until the new agreement 's procedures are in place .
3560 3664 U.N. officials in New York on Friday finished drafting the rules , in consultation with Iraqi diplomats .
3665 3732 The procedures are due to go before the Security Council next week .
3733 3947 The Security Council has said it will not lift the sweeping sanctions imposed on Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait until the U.N. inspectors certify that Baghdad has eliminated its weapons of mass destruction .
