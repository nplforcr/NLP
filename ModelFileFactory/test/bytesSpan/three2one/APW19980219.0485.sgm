646 861 By snapping the cable , the jet , on a training run Feb. 3 from the U.S. air base of Aviano , in northeast Italy , sent the cable car smashing into a mountain at an Alpine resort , killing all 20 aboard the gondola .
862 1015 If Italy receives jurisdiction and decides to indict the crew , the four could stand trial on charges of multiple manslaughter and endangering transport .
1016 1132 The crew returned safely to base after the accident and expressed sympathy in a statement to the victim 's families .
1133 1310 Under NATO 's 1951 Status of Forces Agreement , Italy may make such a request , and `` the U.S. will give full consideration '' to the request , said an Aviano spokesman , Tech .
1311 1331 Sgt. Bill Lincicome .
1332 1441 But the chances that U.S. authorities will let the Italians decide the judicial fate of the crew seemed slim .
1442 1590 Lincicome noted that there has been no precedent for a NATO member surrendering jurisdiction in a probe involving the carrying out of official duty .
1591 1667 Italy 's request will be made in the next few days via the foreign ministry .
1668 1899 Italy was seeking jurisdiction , Flick told the deputies , given the gravity of the tragedy and `` the enormous impression on the Italian population , which has shown the strong desire that justice be carried out in our country . ''
1900 2111 The request comes at a sensitive time , with some small leftist parties which support Premier Romano Prodi 's government opposing U.S. use of Italian or NATO bases in Italy should there be a strike against Iraq .
2112 2243 Flick said the request took into consideration the `` loyal and reciprocal cooperation between the Italian and U.S. authorities . ''
2244 2411 The minister indicated that Italy might ask jurisdiction to probe the role of other Americans attached to Aviano , but that a final decision had n't been made on that .
2412 2572 Italian and American militaries are conducting a joint investigation to determine whether any of the jet 's crew or its commanding officers should face charges .
2573 2729 Italian civilian prosecutors are conducting a separate investigation but will be powerless to try the crew unless American authorities give up jurisdiction .
2730 2848 On Wednesday , Italian news reports said that the jet was well below its approved altitude when the accident happened .
2849 3128 A team of experts appointed by an Italian prosecutor , according to the news agency ANSA , contends the EA-6B Prowler sped between two sets of cables which were 260 feet -LRB- 85 meters -RRB- from the ground at the lowest point and 400 feet -LRB- 125 meters -RRB- at the highest .
3129 3347 The Pentagon has acknowledged that a book used by U.S. military pilots specifically states that pilots in the area where the ski lift is located were to maintain a minimum altitude of 1,000 feet -LRB- 300 meters -RRB- .
3348 3493 Flick said Italy will advance the compensation for the victims , with the United States eventually reimbursing Italy for 75 percent of the costs .
