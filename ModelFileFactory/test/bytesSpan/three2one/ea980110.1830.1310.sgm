0 71 ea980110 .1830.1310 NEWS STORY It 's exam week at Princeton University .
72 101 That means hitting the books .
102 178 And that 's pretty much what you think about when you think about Princeton .
179 250 A great , in fact one of the very best , academic schools in the world .
251 286 And it is that , no doubt about it .
287 361 But it 's not academics that has people excited about Princeton this year .
362 388 Here 's ABC 's JuJu Chang .
389 487 Princeton , one of the nation 's most prestigious universities is ranked number fifteen this year .
488 521 And we 're not talking academics .
522 548 We 're talking basketball .
549 607 Last night , they improved their record to twelve and one .
608 688 Now we 're winning te - games like sol - against solid teams on a regular basis .
689 745 Teams like Texas , North Carolina State and Wake Forest .
746 855 They even gave the current number one team in the country , the University of North Carolina , a tough fight .
856 932 uh I think they 're a team that could contend for the national championship .
933 975 They uh they they really shoot the threes .
976 995 They go back doors .
996 1018 They 're fun to watch .
1019 1056 They 're are n't fun to play against .
1057 1156 Princeton 's coach is flattered , but does not want all the attention going to his players ' heads .
1157 1219 I have n't talked about being underdogs or being uh favorites .
1220 1304 All I tell them to do is to play like underdogs , just work your tails off , fellas .
1305 1363 That scrappy attitude has long been a Princeton tradition .
1364 1408 Watch these tremendous moves now by Bradley .
1409 1486 Since the sixties , when former NBA great Bill Bradley was a Princeton Tiger .
1487 1606 I think that 's still the issue today for Princeton athletics , uh can a team of real students uh play in the big time ?
1607 1700 Students like Steve Goodrich , a history major student with a three five grade point average .
1701 1777 He chose Princeton over three other colleges that offered full scholarships .
1778 1931 We 're probably like the only school in the country where the varsity basketball team has to write , you know , a thesis of eighty pages t - to graduate .
1932 2013 Princeton has always placed a greater emphasis on the scholar in scholar athlete .
2014 2106 In past years , they 've managed big upsets and to scare a number of high ranking opponents .
2107 2134 But this year is different .
2135 2160 This team is really good .
2161 2367 Ivy League schools offers no athletic scholarships , which means Princeton players get in for earning a three point oh , not just for shooting a three pointer , making it harder to recruit the best athlete .
2368 2408 You know , maybe we do n't jump as high .
2409 2543 uh you know , maybe we do n't you know do some things as well but what but what makes us a good team is we we play very well together .
2544 2622 They play well enough to think beyond final exams and dream of the final four .
