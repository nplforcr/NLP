0 544 9801.139 NEWS STORY SOURCE : The Washington Post SECTION : A29 LENGTH : 891 DATE : January 23 , 1998 HEADLINE : U.S. Troops Capture Alleged War Criminal ; Bosnian Serb Accused of Killing 16 Muslims BODY_LEN : 835 SARAJEVO , Bosnia , Jan. 22 - U.S. troops today acted for the first time to capture an alleged Bosnian war criminal , rushing from unmarked vans parked in the northern Serb-dominated city of Bijeljina to seize a former concentration camp commander accused of killing at least 16 Muslims and abusing or terrorizing scores of others .
545 754 Goran Jelisic , a 29-year-old who described himself a `` Serb Adolf '' and had made little attempt to hide his presence in the city , was surrounded without incident as he left his apartment at roughly 8 a.m. .
755 972 He then was transferred to Tuzla , site of the main U.S. military base in Bosnia , and immediately flown to The Hague , where he was placed in the custody of officials from the International War Crimes Tribunal there .
973 1051 The U.S. military action was planned in advance , according to officials here .
1052 1292 But it was carried out during a week in which human rights groups have sharply criticized the Clinton administration for refusing to let U.S. troops seize any of the dozens of the indicted war crimes suspects still at large in this country .
1293 1460 U.S. forces provided backup support to British troops that fatally shot one Serb and captured another last July and to Dutch troops that seized two Croats in December .
1461 1562 The U.S. Embassy here issued a general warning to Americans that they could be at risk for reprisals .
1563 1647 But Jelisic was probably one of the least provocative targets Washington could pick .
1648 1815 He is not considered close to the hard-line Serb leadership and , according to one well-informed diplomat here , `` was not popular '' among fellow Serbs in Bijeljina .
1816 1892 A U.S. military officer said he was `` a thug '' without political standing .
1893 2051 Graham Blewitt , deputy prosecutor of the war crimes tribunal , nonetheless hailed Jelisic 's arrest and said the allegations against him `` are very serious .
2052 2148 The offenses committed were horrific , and the accused was personally involved in a lot of them .
2149 2190 We regard him as a significant arrest . ''
2191 2380 Blewitt added that `` we hope this is not the end of it , '' alluding to the approximately 50 additional publicly indicted war crimes suspects who have not been turned over to the tribunal .
2381 2605 An unknown number of combatants have been indicted secretly by the tribunal , which the United Nations established in 1993 to seek justice for the horrendous human rights abuses that occurred during the 1992-1995 ethnic war .
2606 2828 The two Bosnian entities -- the Serb Republic and Croat-Muslim federation -- are required under the 1995 Dayton peace accord that imposed a cease-fire here to surrender all accused war criminals within their jurisdictions .
2829 2975 But the top two targets , hard-line Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and former Serb military chief Ratko Mladic , are well-protected by armed guards .
2976 3038 The West 's strategy has been to try to undermine their power .
3039 3239 The U.S. military maintains an estimated 8,000 troops in the northeast `` corridor '' of Bosnia that includes Bijeljina , a city of fewer than 100,000 people that remains home to many hard-line Serbs .
3240 3403 But the city itself is not patrolled routinely by Americans and instead falls under the responsibility of Russian peacekeeping forces operating under NATO command .
3404 3593 Officials here say that Moscow 's policy bars any involvement by its soldiers in capturing war criminals , however , and the Russians were not informed in advance of the American operation .
3594 3832 In a June 1995 indictment by the tribunal , Jelisic was charged with genocide , crimes against humanity , violations of the laws or customs of war , and grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions governing the treatment of prisoners of war .
3833 4025 The allegations grew out of reports that he systematically killed Muslims who had been detained at a bus company , a police headquarters in the city of Brcko , and the Luka concentration camp .
4026 4279 In addition , according to a U.N. spokesman here , Jelisic `` created an atmosphere of terror -LRB- at the camp -RRB- by killing , abusing and threatening the detainees , thereby subjecting them to extreme psychological trauma , degradation and fear . ''
4280 4388 Some of the evidence to be presented by the tribunal is based on exhumations conducted near Brcko last year .
4389 4619 Dutch National Radio reported in December that Jelisic told an interviewer he had no regrets for his actions in Brcko , saying he slept well because `` I never used knives to kill people ... That 's why God invented the pistol . ''
4620 4723 When he was captured today , Jelisic was carrying a pistol , according to U.S. officials in Washington .
4724 4825 The tribunal 's chief prosecutor , Louise Arbour , has promised speedy trials for all those detained .
4826 4985 But the tribunal has four trials underway and five more awaiting a courtroom , making it unlikely that Jelisic will be tried for another year , officials said .
4986 5191 Arbour 's predecessor , Richard Goldstone and a group of former U.S. and allied officials and jurists have criticized the Clinton administration for not ordering U.S. troops to seize alleged war criminals .
5192 5324 Goldstone said the U.S. failure to act had provoked contempt for the Dayton accord and impeded the creation of a new Bosnian nation .
5325 5512 But today , an organizer of the group , Nina Bang-Jensen of the Coalition for International Justice in Washington , praised the administration for orchestrating an `` important arrest . ''
