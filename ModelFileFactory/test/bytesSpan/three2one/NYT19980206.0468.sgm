Times News Service dLR ; dQC ; dQL ; UNIONDALE , N.Y. _ Nearly five years ago , when the Islanders drafted right wing Todd Bertuzzi in the first round and defenseman Bryan McCabe in the second , the plan was to rebuild the organization around them , as well as other talented young players .
585 622 But that vision will not be realized .
623 877 In a move that left one player teary-eyed and the other one rattled , the Islanders Friday traded McCabe , the team 's 22-year-old captain , and Bertuzzi , a 23-year-old underachiever , along with a 1998 third-round draft pick , to the Vancouver Canucks .
878 1002 In exchange , the Islanders received Trevor Linden , the marquee forward General Manager Mike Milbury had sought for months .
1003 1224 The trade came hours before a midnight deadline imposed by the National Hockey League as part of a freeze over the next two and a half weeks as many of the National Hockey League 's players compete at the Winter Olympics .
1225 1460 With the Islanders struggling to score goals this season , the opportunity to acquire Linden , a 27-year-old two-time All-Star and former captain of the Canucks , was simply too good for Milbury to pass up , no matter the asking price .
1461 1511 `` It 's a big trade , '' Coach Rick Bowness said .
1512 1541 `` It 's a tough trade , too .
1542 1598 You 're losing a couple of young guys in Bryan and Todd .
1599 1675 But if you want a player like Trevor Linden , you have to give up something .
1676 1703 Obviously , we are excited .
1704 1730 He will be good for us . ''
1731 1819 Linden has struggled in each of the last two seasons , suffering injuries to both knees .
1820 1966 He said Friday evening by telephone that he had resumed skating with the Canucks Friday morning and planned to play for the Canadian Olympic team .
1967 2095 Linden , a right wing who also plays center , will not play for the Islanders on Saturday against the Devils at Nassau Coliseum .
2096 2214 A 10-year veteran of the Canucks , Linden enjoyed his best season in 1995-96 when he recorded 33 goals and 47 assists .
2215 2268 He has 247 goals and 302 assists in 702 career games .
2269 2363 In addition to the injuries , Coach Mike Keenan 's public criticisms also made Linden unhappy .
2364 2505 He was also upset after Mark Messier replaced him as captain of the Canucks after Messier arrived as a free agent at the start of the season .
2506 2564 McCabe was teary-eyed after he received news of the trade .
2565 2796 Walking slowly down the hallway between the visitor and home-team dressing rooms at Nassau Coliseum , he went into the Islanders ' room , stopped to speak to Bertuzzi for a moment , then collected his personal items from his stall .
2797 2869 `` I was shocked , '' McCabe said outside the Islanders ' dressing room .
2870 2901 `` I 'm more sad than anything .
2902 2945 I 've been with these guys for three years .
2946 2981 I do n't want to leave the boys . ''
2982 3015 Bertuzzi sounded more optimistic .
3016 3155 `` Things were n't working out here , '' said Bertuzzi , who had a disappointing seven goals and 11 assists in 52 games with the Islanders .
3156 3249 `` I 'm a little rattled , but looking forward to the new start , nothing but good things . ''
