0 197 ea980129 .1830.0809 NEWS STORY A couple of minutes ago , we reported that the big tobacco companies were in Congress today , pushing hard for a national settlement of all the lawsuits against them .
198 352 The settlement would require the tobacco companies to pay a very large sum of money to the government , and they would agree to be more closely regulated .
353 417 In return , they would get some protection from future lawsuits .
418 524 So tonight , we 're going to take A Closer Look at how far the country has come in three and a half years .
525 546 Do you remember this ?
547 569 Raise your right hand .
570 681 Do you swear that the testimony you 're about to give is the truth , the whole truth and nothing but the truth .
682 687 I do .
688 814 The seven men who ran the tobacco industry almost four years ago I do n't believe that nicotine or our products are addictive .
815 934 swearing one after the other , under oath , that they did not believe that the nicotine in their product was addictive .
935 976 I believe that nicotine is not addictive .
977 1030 And I , too , believe that nicotine is not addictive .
1031 1115 Every one of these big tobacco executives has moved on or been moved since that day .
1116 1129 One has died .
1130 1215 The Justice Department is still investigating whether the others perjured themselves .
1216 1293 Yes , in every imaginable way , times have changed for the tobacco companies .
1294 1334 They 've been under pressure everywhere .
1335 1363 Here is ABC 's Deborah Amos .
1364 1415 Americans have come a long way on the tobacco road .
1416 1440 The romance is gone now .
1441 1457 So is Joe Camel .
1458 1549 Smokers are out in the cold , banned in baseball parks , restaurants and even in some bars .
1550 1666 In the last couple of years , uh just about every state in the union has strengthened their anti-smoking ordinances .
1667 1874 In fact , twenty-eight states have passed some kind of tobacco control measures in the last year alone , raising cigarette taxes , banning billboard ads and vending machine sales , making prisons smoke-free .
1875 1928 And for the first time , under age smokers are fined .
1929 1964 In some states , they are arrested .
1965 2005 We have to sell cigarettes to your kids .
2006 2079 A new attitude towards tobacco and tobacco companies , says Joe Califano .
2080 2198 The tobacco companies had , for decades , lied to the American people and exploited the children of the United States .
2199 2283 Certainly , concern that children were specifically targeted focused political will .
2284 2413 And focused attention not only on the health effects of tobacco but , for the first time , on the conduct of the industry itself .
2414 2427 Did they lie ?
2428 2457 Did they manipulate nicotine ?
2458 2500 Did they intentionally market to children ?
2501 2627 Looking for answers , a cast of powerful characters , the first anti-smoking president ever , aggressive government officials .
2628 2719 You had to have this confluence of events , and you had to have everybody working together .
2720 2816 And most important , whistle blowers , including industry scientist who leaked industry secrets .
2817 2931 You 've got a fantastic pile of evidence against the tobacco companies which forced them to the negotiating table .
2932 2963 So the whole thing has changed .
2964 3034 In the end , it was the industry that chose to deal rather than fight .
3035 3127 The result , historic state settlements , new regulations , the pending national settlement .
3128 3184 Part of that deal , early retirement for this character .
3185 3229 But the tobacco companies are n't giving up .
3230 3334 They 've returned to proven old formulas , betting there 's still some romance and big money in tobacco .
3335 3370 Deborah Amos , ABC News , New York .
3371 3455 Enormous money , of course , to be made , what with tobacco sales here and overseas .
3456 3598 Which is another reason the tobacco companies want a settlement , so that they can get on with making money in a more predictable environment .
3599 3645 A little earlier , we talked about this today .
3646 3713 And it is very rare that a senior tobacco executive talks about it .
3714 3795 We talked to it with Steven Parrish , the senior vice president of Philip Morris .
3796 3915 Mr. Parrish , if you are genuine about this and you want to keep cigarettes away from children , how do you make money ?
3916 4111 Well , we believe , and I guess the proof will be in pudding , but we believe that there w - a - will be adults in this country , as there are today , who uh will want to smoke and enjoy smoking .
4112 4161 And we believe that our business uh will do well .
4162 4338 If I 'm wrong about that , and the only way that people will ever start smoking is if they start smoking as kids , then so be it , and um uh w - we 're prepared to accept that .
4339 4513 Ben LeBowe , tobacco executive who you know well , said that if you do n't have kids coming at the end , in at the beginning , you 'll all be out of business in thirty years .
4514 4543 Do you agree with him at all ?
4544 4595 Well , I do n't agree with him , but I do n't know .
4596 4668 And I guess we 'll just have to wait and see , because we are committed .
4669 4780 And the other thing I would say , we are committed to reducing youth smoking and , if we can , to eliminate it .
4781 4832 Now , you know what your critics say , Mr. Parrish .
4833 5010 You guys are so smart in the tobacco industry , and you 've given the public such a run around for years that if you like this deal , there 's got to be something wrong with it .
5011 5052 Well , I 'm not saying we like this deal .
5053 5117 There are a lot of things in this agreement that we do n't like .
5118 5150 uh But we 're prepared to do it .
5151 5199 um We 've gone on too long fighting and arguing .
5200 5249 We accept our responsibility for prolonging that .
5250 5377 And we are willing and ready to sit down with people , like we have already done , work with others to try to make this happen .
5378 5443 But there 's a lot in this agreement that uh that we do n't like .
5444 5568 As you see smoking reduced in America , are you reassured by the fact that you can sell cigarettes in the rest of the world ?
5569 5595 We have a global business .
5596 5661 We 're the larger largest consumer products company in the world .
5662 5756 So of course , we 're proud to be a global company and sell our products all around the world .
5757 5788 Thanks very much , Mr. Parrish .
5789 5789 .
