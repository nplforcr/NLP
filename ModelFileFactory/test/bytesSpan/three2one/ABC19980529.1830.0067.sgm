0 47 ABC19980529 .1830.0067 NEWS STORY Good evening .
48 202 When former senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona died today , there were a lot of Americans who reached into their memory books to recall a story about him .
203 273 President Clinton called him an American original and a great patriot .
274 338 And people all over the country nodded their heads in agreement .
339 465 And yet , when Goldwater ran for president as the Republican nominee in nineteen sixty four , he was regarded as an extremist .
466 548 And he said in that campaign that extremism in the defense of liberty was no vice .
549 636 He was an American original , a very blunt Republican who helped to redefine his party .
637 729 He died at eighty nine in the western state of Arizona , to which he was so deeply attached .
730 782 So first , we go to Phoenix and ABC 's Brian Rooney .
783 869 Barry Goldwater died this morning in his home overlooking the city and state he loved .
870 948 His wife , Susan , was there , and almost immediately friends began to arrive .
949 1007 The flag was lowered to half staff at the Arizona capitol .
1008 1058 Goldwater was older than the state he made famous .
1059 1107 He was vigorous and rugged into an advanced age .
1108 1199 But two years ago , he suffered a stroke and later was diagnosed with Alzheimer 's Disease .
1200 1394 Blunt and colorful , Goldwater was admired at the end by leaders of both political parties , including President Clinton , whose wife , Hillary , worked for the Goldwater campaign as a teenager .
1395 1452 That he was a great patriot and a truly fine human being .
1453 1484 He was a man ahead of his time .
1485 1535 You look at some of the things they 're doing now .
1536 1570 He was ridiculed for those things .
1571 1615 So he was a man of real courage , great man .
1616 1648 Nancy Reagan issued a statement .
1649 1695 Barry was willing to defy conventional wisdom .
1696 1804 Although he retired from the Senate more than ten years ago , Goldwater stayed active and vocal in politics .
1805 1860 One of his last campaign appearances was with Bob Dole .
1861 1909 We are the new liberals of the Republican Party .
1910 1939 Goddamn can you imagine that ?
1940 2030 Near the end of his life , he said the thing he was proudest of was being born in Arizona .
2031 2084 Having been born in the United States and in Arizona .
2085 2130 I do n't know how the hell you can beat that .
2131 2246 Barry Goldwater 's funeral will be Wednesday at Arizona State University , followed by burial with military honors .
2247 2281 Brian Rooney , ABC News , Phoenix .
2282 2340 In so many ways , Barry Goldwater was defined by the West .
2341 2434 He spent thirty years in Washington , but he never did lose some of the slightly rough edges .
2435 2454 He never wanted to .
2455 2473 I sleep at nights .
2474 2675 ah I have found that if you tell the truth and tell what you really believe , which I have always done , you do n't spend the night tossing and squirming and thinking , God , Almighty , what did I say ?
2676 2826 Goldwater 's grandfather immigrated to the West from Poland and established a chain of successful department stores which Barry ran for fifteen years .
2827 2932 Goldwater was an Army pilot during World War two , and in time he created the Arizona Air National Guard .
2933 2949 He loved to fly .
2950 3015 He ran for the Senate in nineteen fifty two and won resoundingly .
3016 3072 Had n't been for my family voting twice , I do n't know .
3073 3124 He established his conservative views very quickly .
3125 3238 Although he favored racial integration personally , he voted against the Civil Rights Act of nineteen sixty four .
3239 3317 It is not the job of the federal government , he said , to legislate morality .
3318 3394 You ca n't pass a law , he said , that will make me like you or you like me .
3395 3472 Goldwater won the Republican nomination for president in nineteen sixty four .
3473 3532 To his conservative political supporters , he was a savior .
3533 3582 In your heart , they said , you know he 's right .
3583 3630 Extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice .
3631 3730 To his opponents , including President Johnson , who he ran against , he was a dangerous extremist .
3731 3779 In your heart , they said , you know he 's nuts .
3780 3938 Four , five , seven , With political ads like this one that suggested Goldwater would get the nation into war with the Soviets , President Johnson buried him .
3939 4083 When you lose an election by sixty to forty , ah then you ca n't even begin to think of anything you might have done that would have changed it .
4084 4375 But Goldwater 's conservative views , he thought the nation could win in Vietnam if the military was allowed a freer hand , and he thought the enemy at home was the government itself , helped him to win five states in the Democratic South , which laid the ground for his party 's resurgence .
4376 4440 I give you the next president of the United States , Dick Nixon .
4441 4517 But Richard Nixon proved that Barry Goldwater was never a slavish party man .
4518 4671 In nineteen seventy four at the height of the Watergate scandal , Senator Goldwater was one of the first Republicans to tell Nixon that he should resign .
4672 4714 He called Nixon the world 's biggest liar .
4715 4880 In time , he would say that Ronald Reagan was either an incompetent or a liar , when Mr. Reagan said he did n't know about diverting money to the Nicaraguan contras .
4881 4974 In time , he would come to be an outspoken supporter of a woman 's right to have an abortion .
4975 5026 I do n't think we should ever tamper with abortion .
5027 5054 You 'll never stamp it out .
5055 5166 It 's been in , it 's been in existence since the world began , and it 's going to be here when the world ends .
5167 5276 And when it came to gays in his beloved military , he said you did n't need to be straight to shoot straight .
5277 5342 In the end , Goldwater was very much with himself and his family .
5343 5442 As he got older , he used to sit on his beloved hilltop and say of his critics , to hell with them .
5443 5505 I 'd just like to be remembered as an honest person who tried .
5506 5560 We said there were a lot of stories from people today .
5561 5700 Just one personal note , Ted Koppel and I were two of the young correspondents who covered his presidential campaign thirty five years ago .
5701 5798 It was n't always easy for us to see the man through the incendiary campaign rhetoric of the day .
5799 6015 One of the old timers who had covered the White House since Franklin Roosevelt 's first term surprised us one day when he said that if he was ever marooned on a desert island , he would like Goldwater as a companion .
6016 6130 Goldwater , he said , would know how to get us out of trouble , and he would always make interesting conversation .
6131 6321 After seeing the senator off and on through the intervening years , Ted and I agree today that if we were ever marooned on a desert island , Barry Goldwater would have been a perfect choice .
6322 6322 .
