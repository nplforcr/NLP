395 678 The combination of Seattle-based Washington Mutual and Ahmanson , the holding company for Home Savings of America , would form the nation 's seventh-largest consumer bank , with 6 million customers and about 2,000 branches stretching from Texas to California , as well as in Florida .

759 852 While the sale passed the boards of both companies , it still must be approved by regulators .
853 997 Analysts said other thrifts may follow Washington Mutual 's lead , with the strong economy and a healthy industry leading to more consolidation .
998 1240 Industry experts generally applauded the acquisition , saying it would help Washington Mutual better compete with large banks such as BankAmerica Corp. and Wells Fargo d Co. , which it will surpass in size with assets of nearly $ 150 billion .
1241 1400 In recent years , thrifts have begun offering an array of financial products , including insurance , mutual funds and brokerage services to compete with banks .
1401 1602 `` It 's a great acquisition for both Washington Mutual and Ahmanson shareholders , '' said Martin Friedman , a senior thrift analyst with the investment bank Friedman , Billings d Ramsey in Arlington .
1603 1727 `` It creates a powerful consumer franchise in California that will be able to compete effectively against the big banks . ''

1896 2006 It was eventually acquired by Washington Mutual after Ahmanson made a hostile offer for the California thrift .

2992 3198 The purchase price , about 19 times earnings , was in line with what other thrifts have paid in acquisitions in recent months but slightly less than banks , which have been fetching 20 to 25 times earnings .
