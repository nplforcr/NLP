0 110 VOA19980629 .1800.0766 NEWS STORY The start of the new millennium could bring computer chaos around the world .
111 237 Without major adjustments , most systems will not be able to enter the new century because their internal clocks will run out .
238 373 VOA 's Paula Wolfson reports computer experts say there is no easy fix and they are warning the US Congress that time is slipping away .
374 449 The twentieth century will probably go down in history as the computer age .
450 585 We 've gone from crude adding machines to systems capable of sending data across the street or around the world in the blink of an eye .
586 629 But trouble looms in the year two thousand .
630 706 The computers of the twentieth century are not ready for the new millennium .
707 768 They read the current year by using the last two digits only .
769 876 They will not be able to cope when they read the year two thousand , seeing it instead as nineteen hundred .
877 1037 It seemed like a simple problem , one that could be easily fixed by upgraded software but experts say it is extraordinarily complex and the public is in denial .
1038 1168 A large segment of the population is waiting for Bill Gates and Microsoft to release MS two thousand , the millennium virus fixer .
1169 1204 There is no millennium virus fixer .
1205 1296 Alan Simpson has been involved for years in the creation of global communications networks .
1297 1407 He says Americans must realize the threat posed by the so called millennium bug is very real and very serious .
1408 1501 We 're not an island insulated from the telecommunications problems of the rest of the world .
1502 1574 We trade , we communicate , and we point nuclear missiles at each other .
1575 1650 The potential for catastrophic miscommunication in two thousand is immense .
1651 1782 If nothing is done , people will wake up on the first day of the new millennium and find computer related services at a standstill .
1783 1927 Air traffic will come to a sudden halt , banking and stock market activities will cease , and international communications links will shut down .
1928 1959 The possibilities are enormous .
1960 2146 The Clinton Administration predicts it will cost five billion dollars just to fix US government computer systems but critics charge the Administration 's efforts are way behind schedule .
2147 2270 California Republican Steve Horn is Chairman of a House Subcommittee concerned with the year two thousand computer problem .
2271 2313 There 's not enough time to do everything .
2314 2370 There are too many problems contending for top priority .
2371 2438 We must be careful in the selection of the most important problems .
2439 2538 Mr. Horn predicts Congress will have to approve billions in emergency spending to get the job done .
2539 2644 But even if the United States completes its computer adjustments on time , America can not be complacent .
2645 2769 It 's an interdependent world warn the experts and many other countries have not even begun to deal with the millennium bug .
2770 2842 Dan Steinberg is a lawyer involved with international technology issues .
2843 3005 He says most of the information on the year two thousand computer crisis is published and disseminated in English , creating problems for many developing nations .
3006 3032 They also have less money .
3033 3059 This comes as no surprise .
3060 3101 We give foreign aid to most of the world .
3102 3264 It should be no surprise that those without sufficient funds , we 're worried about funding right here in town , they can not solve their problems quickly enough .
3265 3407 When the World Bank sent out a letter asking countries for information about their plans to deal with the millennium bug , many never replied .
3408 3526 Telecommunications specialist Alan Simpson says the United States must take the lead on this issue at home and abroad .
3527 3620 We must create from strong leadership an environment that the problems can and will be fixed .
3621 3744 It is this type of environment that this country was able to mobilize its enormous resources and prepare for World War two .
3745 3837 Mr. Simpson warns if international computer chaos occurs , the United States will be blamed .
3838 3953 He says governments around the world will point to their American design technology and say , it 's all your fault .
