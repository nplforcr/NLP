0 211 VOA19980312 .1800.2117 NEWS STORY Amnesty International , the human rights group , is urging the UN human rights commission to take a tough stance against nations that violate the human rights of their citizens .
212 285 Amnesty International is urging the commission to focus on six countries .
286 323 Lisa Schlein has the story in Geneva .
324 452 Amnesty International has singled out Algeria , Cambodia , Colombia , Kenya , Saudi Arabia , and Turkey , for special attention .
453 565 It says these countries are guilty of a pattern of systematic , persistent , and severe human rights violations .
566 623 The human rights group is especially critical of Algeria .
624 737 It says it will demand international action to end six years of what it calls human rights atrocities in Algeria .
738 886 Amnesty 's director of legal affairs , Nicholas Howen , says about eighty thousand people have been killed since the start of the Algerian conflict .
887 1034 And in the essence of what is happening in Algeria is the impunity , that no one is brought to justice for what is happening , and so it continues .
1035 1195 There is no other country in the world where the human rights violations are so extreme , but where there has been no international scrutiny , let alone action .
1196 1234 No resolutions , no visits by experts .
1235 1243 Nothing .
1244 1367 Mr. Howen also says there must be an investigation into the killings of ethnic Albanians in the Serbian province of Kosovo .
1368 1536 He says there 's strong reason to believe that many of the people , including women and children , were victims of extra-judicial killings carried out by Serb soldiers .
1537 1722 The office of the High Commission for Human Rights in Belgrade must urgently carry out an investigation in Kosovo province , be given full access , and be backed up by forensic experts .
1723 1803 And most importantly , they must report to the Commission during the Commission .
1804 1904 Because then it is the responsibility of the Commission to say what its nex - next action should be .
1905 2038 Mr. Howen sharply criticized the European Union 's decision not to support any Commission resolution on China 's human rights record .
2039 2119 He says the EU action has already cast a shadow over the work of the Commission .
2120 2297 He says the decision has more to do with policy splits between EU member states , and with lucrative markets , than with any real improvement in China 's human rights situation .
