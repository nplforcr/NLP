Hill , the onetime business partner of the late Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown , was indicted yesterday by a federal grand jury on charges that she diverted more than $ 200,000 from companies she controlled to buy clothes and jewelry for herself and failed to report it as income on her tax returns .
530 764 Hill , 53 , a Dallas broadcasting entrepreneur who owned WFTY-TV -LRB- Channel 50 -RRB- in Washington and another station in Massachusetts , also was charged with diverting more than $ 557,000 from one of her companies to her partner .
765 977 Although Brown was not named in the indictment , he was her partner in that company , First International Communications Corp. , which failed to put together any successful business ventures during its existence .
978 1106 The nine-count indictment also charged Kenneth C. White , 49 , a Maryland resident and former executive of one of her companies .
1107 1235 The case results from an investigation by the Justice Department that was begun by former independent counsel Daniel S. Pearson .
1236 1362 The Justice Department took over the probe after Brown died in a plane crash in Croatia in 1996 and Pearson closed his office .
1363 1608 The charges against Hill and White include conspiracy to defraud the Internal Revenue Service , conspiracy to defraud the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. , making false statements and aiding and assisting in the preparation of false tax returns .
1609 1860 One of Hill 's attorneys , Courtney Simmons Elwood , said yesterday that Hill is `` innocent '' and `` deeply regrets that the government 's investigation -LRB- of Brown -RRB- has ended with unfounded charges against his former business associates . ''
1861 1915 Before his death , Brown repeatedly denied wrongdoing .
1916 2090 His attorney , Reid H. Weingarten , said yesterday that the grand jury not only did not name Brown , but did not charge that he was `` a knowing participant in wrongdoing . ''
2091 2279 The grand jury said that Hill spent thousands of dollars on trips to tropical climates , and on jewelry and designer clothes at expensive stores and boutiques from Beverly Hills to Boston .
2280 2420 She shopped at such high-priced stores as Gucci at the Watergate , Jean Claude Jitrois of Beverly Hills , and Escada Boutique in Palm Beach .
2421 2594 During the time of the alleged illegal activities , Hill was president of Corridor Broadcasting Corp. , a Texas company that owned Channel 50 and WHLL-TV in the Boston area .
2595 2711 The grand jury said that during the mid-1980s , Corridor borrowed $ 21 million from Sunbelt Savings d Loan in Texas .
2712 2815 Corridor did not make payments on the loan , which the FDIC took over as creditor after Sunbelt failed .
2816 3012 In meetings with FDIC officials , Hill and White allegedly lied about Corridor 's financial condition and supplied the agency with doctored books and records that hid numerous diversions of funds .
3013 3163 According to the indictment , Hill siphoned off nearly $ 200,000 from Corridor and another $ 37,000 from another company to cover her shopping binges .
3164 3316 She allegedly spent that money at the same time she collected a generous annual salary that ranged from $ 170,000 to nearly $ 260,000 from 1990 to 1994 .
3317 3447 At the same time , Hill formed First International Communications Corp. to pursue possible foreign and domestic business ventures .
3448 3543 Her partner in that company was Brown , a former chairman of the Democratic National Committee .
3544 3794 Hill , who sometimes shows up to business meetings wearing leather and driving a Harley-Davidson motorcycle , often bragged about how her business ties to Brown provided her with access to Washington 's elite , according to friends and other sources .
3795 3891 She also credited Brown with getting her invited to the White House on at least three occasions .
3892 4221 The grand jury said that Hill and White diverted large sums of money from Corridor and another company , Jasas Corp. , `` for the purpose of making payments to and for the benefit of -LRB- Hill 's -RRB- business partner '' in First International and her limited partner in yet another business venture , FICC Limited Partnership .
4222 4245 Brown was that partner .
4246 4398 Pearson , the independent counsel , was appointed in 1995 to investigate how Brown made nearly $ 500,000 by selling his interest in First International .
4399 4634 In exchange for selling his interest back to the firm , Brown received $ 135,000 in cash , forgiveness of a $ 72,000 debt he owed to another company owned by Hill and an agreement that $ 300,000 in his personal debts would be paid off .
4635 4835 Although again not naming Brown , the grand jury said Hill and White diverted nearly $ 300,000 in company funds to Hill 's personal attorney , who , in turn , used the money to pay off Brown 's debts .
4836 4907 Hill allegedly used her companies ' funds to pay off her debts as well .
4908 5054 Her shopping sprees rarely cost less than $ 1,000 and cost as much as $ 5,438 , which she spent in one day in 1993 at St. John Boutique in Dallas .
5055 5213 She also spent thousands of dollars on airline tickets to the Bahamas , London and Ecuador for herself , her family and friends , according to the grand jury .
5214 5375 The indictment said Hill failed to reimburse her companies and should have reported the funds she received as income on her tax returns for 1991 , 1992 and 1993 .
5376 5560 While she spent the money , she allegedly lied to Sunbelt loan officials in 1989 about Corridors ' operations by painting a `` bleak financial picture , '' according to the grand jury .
5561 5704 Two years later , Hill and White allegedly told Sunbelt officials that Corridor had a cash flow crisis and could n't make payments on its loan .
5705 5831 Hill also allegedly lied when she said she was not drawing a salary and was paying corporate legal fees out of her own pocket .
