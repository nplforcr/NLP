Times News Service dLR ; dQC ; dQL ; HAKUBA , Japan _ This time , the men 's downhill actually got a couple of skiers out of the start before the race was postponed .
423 700 Unfortunately , they were only the runners who test the mountain , and when one of them skied off the course in a steady downpor of pellet-like rain , arms went up in disgust , jackets went on , helmets came off and the nightmare of a weather-plagued Alpine Olympics continued .
701 850 Six days into the Nagano Games , one Alpine event _ the women 's super-G won on Wednesday by Picabo Street of the United States _ has been completed .
851 1087 The men 's downhill , traditionally the Sunday kickoff and Alpine 's premier event , has suddenly become just another race to squeeze into a schedule that has become woefully backed up as the Games move toward the end of the first week .
1088 1193 The event has gone from Sunday 's original date to a Wednesday rescheduling that was changed to Thursday .
1194 1381 When the race was called again around midday , with a steady rain falling , Olympic organizers went back to the drawing board to recast the schedule yet again , moving the race to Friday .
1382 1549 Also postponed Thursday was the men 's combined downhill , which held its two slalom runs on Tuesday in a swirling snowstorm , despite many of the skiers ' objections .
1550 1728 The combined downhill was moved to Friday along with the regular men 's downhill , forcing postponement of the men 's super-G , which had originally been scheduled for that date .
1729 1856 In addition , the first training run for the women 's downhill was lost , reducing the number of training runs to one , Friday .
1857 2093 With the slalom events dominating the second week , and many of the skiers harboring medal hopes in those disciplines as well as the speed events , the window on some semblance of an orderly and even complete Alpine Olympics is closing .
2094 2228 The forecast was calling for clear and sunny conditions on Friday , the new date for the men 's downhill and men 's combined downhill .
2229 2314 Monday was the only off day between Thursday and the last day of the Games , Feb. 22 .
2315 2480 Other possible dates for maneuverability are Sunday and next Tuesday , both days originally set aside for the women 's combined , which is not a high priority event .
2481 2688 With each postponement , the men 's downhill favorites grow more frustrated , particularly the Austrians , who dominated the three training runs last week and believed they were peaking in time for the race .
2689 2711 `` Now , who knows ? ''
2712 2779 Hermann Maier said after a fourth training run was added Wednesday .
2780 2834 Norway 's Kjetil Andre Aamodt posted the fastest time .
2835 2886 Also , the draw has to be recast for each new date .
2887 3002 For Thursday 's run , the Americans A.J. Kitt and Tommy Moe had drawn the 16th and 17th positions in a field of 43 .
3003 3143 That left them just outside the top 15 , but not far enough down the list so that the course would be chewed up by the time they were on it .
3144 3259 Moe , the defending gold medalist , has not had a top 15 finish in the downhill this season , was said to be upset .
3260 3328 This is hardly the first time weather has plagued the Alpine events .
3329 3433 In Sarajevo in 1984 , Bill Johnson of the United States won the downhill on the 14th day of competition .
3434 3652 But the snow that can quickly change to rain and turn the course into a slushy mess had ski veterans shaking their heads Thursday , and at least one Salt Lake City official promising this would not be the case in 2002 .
3653 3721 At this rate , they may run the 2002 men 's downhill before 1998 's .
