0 372 9803.226 NEWS STORY SOURCE : The Washington Post SECTION : C09 LENGTH : 596 DATE : March 18 , 1998 HEADLINE : Comsat Finally Sells Satellite-Making Unit ; New York Company Dishes Out $ 116.5 Million for RSI BODY_LEN : 562 Comsat Corp. said yesterday that it has a buyer for its RSI satellite equipment manufacturing division , nearly one year after putting it up for sale .
373 536 The Bethesda-based satellite communications company said that TBG Industries Inc. , a privately owned New York holding company , would buy RSI for $ 116.5 million .
537 769 RSI , based in Sterling , designs , manufactures , installs and operates ground-based satellite antenna systems , air-traffic control radar , radio astronomy antennas and other communications systems for military and commercial use .
770 867 The sale reduces Comsat 's payroll almost by half : RSI employs 1,200 of Comsat 's 2,600 workers .
868 985 TBG officials did not return calls seeking comment , but a Comsat spokeswoman said she did not expect layoffs at RSI .
986 1092 Comsat bought RSI for $ 150 million in stock in February 1994 , when it was called Radiation Systems Inc. .
1093 1243 RSI had $ 10 million in annual profit , $ 120 million in sales and had just won an $ 18 million contract to furnish three satellite systems to Kuwait .
1244 1372 Bruce Crockett , Comsat 's chairman at the time , predicted the unit would have sales of $ 400 million to $ 500 million by 1997 .
1373 1411 But RSI fell far short of those goals .
1412 1617 Comsat declined to release specific figures but said that RSI in 1997 accounted for `` the majority '' of $ 300 million in revenue from its technology services unit , which includes Comsat 's laboratories .
1618 1831 Crockett 's replacement as president and chief executive , Betty Alewine , put RSI up for sale last March as part of her strategy to focus on Comsat 's core business of providing satellite communications services .
1832 1945 In June , Comsat declared RSI a discontinued operation , and the company took a $ 60 million write-off last year .
1946 2110 `` It 's good to get this non-core , difficult operation out of the way , '' said George Reed Dellinger , a telecommunications analyst for HSBC Washington Analysis .
2111 2178 `` Unfortunately , this probably was not a good fit '' with Comsat .
2179 2328 The sale price is subject to adjustment based on loans and advances between Comsat Corp. and RSI at the time the deal closes , Comsat officials said .
2329 2386 Comsat will use sale proceeds to pay off short-term debt .
2387 2502 Comsat agreed to keep two divisions of RSI , called Electromechanical Systems Inc. and Plexsys International Corp. .
2503 2604 Comsat also will keep a long-term construction contract for a radio telescope in Green Bank , W. Va. .
2605 2744 The company in late February sold another RSI subsidiary , JEFA Wireless Systems , to Able Telecom Holding Corp. for an undisclosed amount .
2745 2806 Comsat shares closed yesterday at $ 34.75 , up 31Ê1\/4 cents .
2807 2904 The sale marks the last major piece of Alewine 's plan to divest Comsat of extraneous businesses .
2905 3068 The company last year spun off its 80 percent ownership stake in Ascent Entertainment Group , which owns a film studio and two professional sports teams in Denver .
3069 3336 The company now focuses on providing satellite services to customers as the largest owner and user of the Intelsat and Inmarsat satellite consortia , and on building digital communications networks -- using land - and space-based equipment -- for businesses overseas .
3337 3537 Comsat 's next challenge is to fend off legislation pending in Congress that calls for a quicker and more extensive privatization of Intelsat than the treaty organization is on the verge of approving .
3538 3813 Comsat calls the legislation punitive because if the congressional schedule is not met it would allow Comsat 's U.S. customers to have direct access to Intelsat services and could restrict Comsat from providing some new services it already offers , including Internet access .
