454 598 By doing so , Alija Izetbegovic , 73 , missed his chance to become the first leader from former Yugoslavia to give up his presidential position .
599 774 In all five republics that became countries , national leaders who took over the posts between 1989 and 1991 and participated in the division of Yugoslavia are still in power .
775 879 `` Balkan leaders do n't want to step down from power , '' Izetbegovic jokingly told a press conference .
880 1060 For months , Izetbegovic signaled that he intended to withdraw from state politics and concentrate on serving as president of the ruling Muslim Party of Democratic Action , or SDA .
1061 1137 He cited health problems and old age as reasons why he wanted to step aside .
1138 1328 Izetbegovic said he was sure he would pull out of public life until late Thursday , when 68 out of 88 party leaders demanded that he become a candidate for Bosnia 's three-member presidency .
1329 1459 At Friday 's press conference , Izetbegovic indicated he did n't expect to survive a four-year term as a member of the presidency .
1460 1563 He suffered a second heart attack in February 1996 and was told by doctors he should n't work any more .
1564 1689 Izetbegovic is expected to win most of the Muslim votes and remain in the joint presidency after September general elections .
1690 1879 But many opposition leaders , independent analysts and experts foresee the Muslim SDA party _ with or without Izetbegovic _ to follow the trend of the ruling Bosnian Croat and Serb parties .
1880 2118 The hard-line Bosnian Serb party already has lost its absolute majority and monopoly over the votes of most Bosnian Serbs in the country , while the same fate is expected for the ruling Bosnian Croat party after a recent leadership split .
