0 133 CNN19980321 .1130.0616 NEWS STORY There 's an invisible pollutant in gasoline that clogs up catalytic converters and dirties the air .
134 258 It 's sulfur , and as Ed Garsten reports in today 's edition of tech trends , the petroleum industry is proposing a cleanup .
259 337 You ca n't see it , but sulfur is in every gallon of gas you pump in your car .
338 422 The chemical impurity gums up anti-pollution devices , such as catalytic converters .
423 577 On the average , there are three hundred and forty parts per million of sulfur in gasoline , except in California , where regulations mandate only thirty .
578 704 Now the petroleum industry is proposing to lower sulfur content in gasoline sold everywhere , but not as low as in California .
705 924 Why should drivers in clean air states like Iowa or Wyoming pay for California style gasoline when they would be better served with a lower priced , more conventional gasoline that still produces environmental benefits ?
925 1082 the proposal calls for cutting sulfur levels in half to a hundred and fifty parts per million in gas sold in seventeen states where air quality is a problem .
1083 1202 Gas sold in every other state except California would have a reduced sulfur content of three hundred parts per million .
1203 1324 The proposal by the petroleum industry , though , is at odds with what the nation 's big three auto makers are demanding .
1325 1400 They want sulfur content in all gasoline to be as low as California levels .
1401 1640 We need those clean fuels like they have in California nationwide so that all citizens can get the benefit of cleaner air and that all of our cars and trucks will be able to run with more reliability on the fuel that 's in the marketplace .
1641 1741 Detroit plans to introduce vehicles with more efficient anti-pollution devices as soon as next fall .
1742 1826 But the automakers say those devices will work better with California type gasoline .
1827 1920 Well there 's no argument over who will pay the price for lowering sulfur levels in gasoline .
1921 1950 That 's right , the consumer .
1951 2026 Estimates range anywhere from a penny to twenty cents more a gallon of gas .
2027 2113 Some drivers we spoke with say their pockets are only so deep to save the environment .
2114 2151 A couple of cents , I mean not a lot .
2152 2195 Five would be good , but no more than that .
2196 2203 Indeed .
2204 2301 While the federal government will ultimately decide the issue , the consumer will ultimately pay .
