0 225 PRI19980602 .2000.0874 NEWS STORY Today in Geneva , hundreds of children from Africa , Asia , and Latin America descended on the headquarters of the International Labor Organization to protest the exploitation of child labor .
226 320 The demonstration was the climax of a six month global campaign against child labor practices .
321 471 It also coincides with the ILO 's annual conference , which hopes to come up with new legislation to abolish the worst forms of child labor worldwide .
472 590 As Clair Dual reports from Geneva , the protests are an attempt to get governments to take action against child labor .
591 683 These seven year olds are scavenging for coal in a mine near the Colombian capital , Bogota .
684 756 The poorest of the poor , they survive by selling the coal to middlemen .
757 907 The ILO estimates two hundred and fifty million such children work in developing countries , with particularly high numbers in Asia and Latin America .
908 1038 Global March organizer Kylash Satiati , says both developed and developing countries have long ignored the problem of child labor .
1039 1136 There is a serious lack of political will right from the countries up to the international level .
1137 1219 So it was necessary to mobilize the whole world against the menace of child labor .
1220 1377 For the past six months , march participants have been calling for an end to child labor , taking their protests to forty-three countries on four continents .
1378 1440 But child labor is not just a problem of the developing world .
1441 1534 It 's estimated one million children pick fruits and vegetables in the United States as well .
1535 1661 Global March participant Diana Mull says it 's a disgrace that children are exploited in such a highly industrialized country .
1662 1850 The United States is going to point a finger at other countries and say you need to clean up your act , then the United States needs to sweep on its own doorsteps and clean up its own act .
1851 1939 This is a time when we need to put a spotlight and focus on ourselves and make a change .
1940 2022 Worldwide only sixty countries have adopted conventions on abolishing child labor .
2023 2139 Most developing world countries including the United States have refused to ratify a minimum working age of fifteen .
2140 2290 The ILO director for child labor Asephy Bekhali admits there 's been limited progress in getting children off the work bench and into the school yard .
2291 2460 The ILO can not enforce international law through uh military means , but there is a moral pressure , there is public pressure , which I think acts as a major deterrent .
2461 2699 The ILO is proposing a new convention on the elimination of the worst forms of child labor , including slavery , prostitution , and hazardous work , but such legislation can only be adopted in nineteen ninety-nine and ratified much later .
2700 2762 For supporters of the global March , that 's too long to wait .
2763 2860 Organizer Kylash Satiati says it 's a crime against humanity to subject children to bonded labor .
2861 2962 His group rescued seven year old Nasheva from a life of slavery in the carpet industry outside Delhi .
2963 3108 He says that three of us tried to escape one day , but I was caught by the employer , he took me and um put me in lock and key for the whole day .
3109 3250 Then in the evening he brought a stove , with some red hot iron , and then branded my whole body with those iron rods , and I lost my speech .
3251 3300 I was crying and crying , and then I lost speech .
3301 3367 Bonded labor is a problem not just in India but across south Asia .
3368 3506 Pakistan has come under heavy international criticism for the pay and conditions of children stitching footballs for the world soccer cup .
3507 3638 Its child labor expert at the UN , Tamina Janjoor , says Pakistan will sign a new convention banning extreme forms of exploitation .
3639 3752 But , she says , when children are the sole breadwinners , the solution is to provide education in the workplace .
3753 3820 She warns , however , that an immediate improvement is unrealistic .
3821 3994 We all want the elimination of child labor , but the problem is we are a developing country , and even in the most industrialized countries , child labor continues to exist .
3995 4278 So while they have not been able to completely eliminate child labor , to expect that certain developing countries w - where questions of survival are important questions are expected t - t - to overnight to change the situation , that , I 'm afraid , will take a little bit of time .
4279 4532 Global March activists believe poverty is not an excuse for waiting to eliminate child labor , but results depend on countries not only signing the convention but also implementing it , and that means cracking down on companies that exploit child labor .
4533 4623 That will be the next step in the long battle against international child labor practices .
4624 4683 For The World , this is Clair Dual in Geneva , Switzerland .
