0 369 9801.403 NEWS STORY SOURCE : The Washington Post SECTION : A09 LENGTH : 696 DATE : January 09 , 1998 HEADLINE : Cisneros Pleads Not Guilty to Lying to FBI About Payments to Ex-Mistress BODY_LEN : 677 Former housing secretary Henry Cisneros pleaded not guilty yesterday to felony charges that he lied to the FBI about paying $ 250,000 in hush money to a former mistress .
370 659 He is charged with a multifaceted conspiracy in which he allegedly worked frantically before , during and after his confirmation as housing secretary to keep his ex-mistress from disclosing their long relationship and the extent of payments he made to her to keep their relationship quiet .
660 840 The grand jury said that Cisneros also made payments to a second woman whom the ex-mistress , Linda Medlar , knew about , and that Medlar was being paid to keep that quiet as well .
841 969 Initially , it appeared that Cisneros and Medlar , who also is charged in the case , would not appear together in the courtroom .
970 1115 At the start of the arraignment , U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin announced that Medlar would not make her appearance until later in the day .
1116 1247 But just after Cisneros and two other defendants had settled into their seats at the defense table , the courtroom door burst open .
1248 1376 Attorney Roger Adelman , a burly former federal prosecutor , stormed into the well of the court with Medlar trailing behind him .
1377 1481 Adelman launched rapid-fire into the arraignment routine , leaving Sporkin 's clerk somewhat speechless .
1482 1610 He quickly waived formal reading of the 66-page indictment and announced that his client was pleading not guilty to all charges .
1611 1691 `` You are always ahead of the game , Mr. Adelman , '' Sporkin said , chuckling .
1692 1843 When Medlar joined the other defendants yesterday at the defense table , Cisneros looked directly at her , and they appeared to acknowledge each other .
1844 1941 But she did not hold his gaze and sat at the far end of the table , leaning away from the others .
1942 1973 Their trial was set for Nov. 4 .
1974 2159 Cisneros , 43 , a former mayor of San Antonio , headed the Department of Housing and Urban Development from 1993 through 1996 and once was considered a rising star in national politics .
2160 2265 He was indicted last month on charges of conspiracy , obstruction of justice and making false statements .
2266 2497 Outside the courthouse , Cisneros spoke out for the first time since he was indicted , addressing reporters in English and Spanish : `` I regret the pain that this matter has caused my wife , my children , my parents and my family .
2498 2540 They are wonderful , good , loving people .
2541 2667 `` I care deeply about my community , and I love our country , which I 've tried to serve in a number of different capacities .
2668 2964 I came to Washington to try to do good , and I 'm proud of the good we were able to do , '' said Cisneros , accompanied by his attorney , Brendan V. Sullivan Jr. `` I have deep faith and trust in America 's institutions and particularly believe in the inherent fairness of our judicial system . ''
2965 3076 Cisneros now lives in Los Angeles , where he is president of Univision , a Spanish-language television network .
3077 3172 Medlar , 45 , of Lubbock , Tex. , is also charged with conspiracy and making a false statement .
3173 3379 She goes on trial Jan. 15 in Lubbock in a related case for conspiracy to commit bank fraud in connection with a house purchased in the names of her relatives with money she allegedly received from Cisneros .
3380 3541 In the Lubbock case , her attorney , a public defender , has filed motions to suppress statements she made to independent counsel David M. Barrett 's assistants .
3542 3650 Her Lubbock lawyer alleges that Medlar was having serious emotional problems , and that prosecutors knew it .
3651 3742 Barrett 's office initially entered into a cooperation agreement with her in November 1995 .
3743 3784 But prosecutors became suspicious of her .
3785 3979 In the Washington case , she is charged with lying to the FBI when she said she had given original tapes to the Internal Revenue Service of conversations with Cisneros she had secretly recorded .
3980 4117 Because Medlar says she can not afford to pay for an attorney , taxpayers will be paying legal fees for Adelman , who is court-appointed .
4118 4285 The two other defendants in the Washington case are former Cisneros aides Sylvia Arce-Garcia , 43 , of Los Angeles , and John D. Rosales , 41 , of the Washington area .
4286 4325 Arce-Garcia is charged with conspiracy .
4326 4403 Rosales is charged with conspiracy and two counts of making false statements .
