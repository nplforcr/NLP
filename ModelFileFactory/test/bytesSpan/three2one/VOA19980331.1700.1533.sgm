0 168 VOA19980331 .1700.1533 NEWS STORY The US government recently announced new regulations designed to change the way transplant organs are made available to sick patients .
169 296 Under the new guidelines , donor organs will be made available to the sickest people first , wherever they live in the country .
297 382 Currently , transplant organs are rationed through a regional system of distribution .
383 508 The private group that runs the current system , United Network for Organ Sharing , or UNOS , objects to the new regulations .
509 672 UNOS says the regulations put the federal government in charge of deciding who gets transplants and that many hospital transplant centers would be forced to close .
673 985 Health and Human Services Secretary Do - Donna Shalala says patients who need an organ transplant should not have to take a chance that an organ will become available in their local area , nor should patients have to travel to transplant centers far from their homes to improve their chances of getting an organ .
986 1154 UNOS spokeswoman Donna Henry Wright says the new policy would not necessarily be more fair or effective because allowances are already made for the most needy patients .
1155 1202 The sickest patients are already treated first .
1203 1306 There are not huge waiting uh disparit - waiting time disparities amongst the very uh sickest patients .
1307 1397 It 's between two to six days for every one uh of the sickest patients across the country .
1398 1508 um So it 's a - it 's a fallacy that they 're doing this because um the sickest patients are n't being served .
1509 1735 Doctor James Burdick , the Professor of Transplant Surgery at Johns Hopkins University Hospital in Baltimore , Maryland , and former President of UNOS , said the current system has evolved over several years and it works well .
1736 1811 You may , in a year or two , save a few more lives if you do sickest first .
1812 2012 But the number of patients waiting then begins to increase , um and , in fact , um over the years many more patients who are about to die of liver tra - uh without a liver transplant would accumulate .
2013 2123 If you do the uh alternative extreme , you do n't save as many lives in the early years , by a small fraction .
2124 2175 Our system is balanced , it 's right in the middle .
2176 2213 And , therefore , it works very well .
2214 2368 Nationwide , there are about ten thousand patients waiting for liver transplants each year and only four thousand organs become available for transplants .
2369 2516 Secretary Shalala says UNOS five months ago , or gave them five months to develop a new plan to distribute livers which are in the shortest supply .
