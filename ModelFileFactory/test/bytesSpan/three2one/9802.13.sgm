0 581 9802.13 NEWS STORY SOURCE : The Washington Post SECTION : A18 LENGTH : 1035 DATE : February 28 , 1998 HEADLINE : Riady Denies Ties to Chinese Spy Agency ; Clinton Friend Rejects Senate Panel Claims BODY_LEN : 1030 JAKARTA , Indonesia , Feb. 27 - James Riady , the Indonesian businessman who befriended President Clinton in Arkansas and became a major contributor to the Democratic Party , today denied allegations in a recent draft report by a Senate committee 's Republican majority that he and his company , the Lippo Group , had ties to a Chinese government intelligence agency .
582 741 In a written statement provided at the end of an interview , Riady also sought to clarify his relationship with former Democratic Party fund-raiser John Huang .
742 981 The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee spent almost a year investigating many aspects of alleged campaign finance abuses in the 1996 presidential and congressional elections , including a `` plan '' by China to influence U.S. elections .
982 1131 `` I did not receive any information from John that I was told was classified , or that I believed to be classified , '' Riady said in the statement .
1132 1287 `` I did not ask John to give me any American classified intelligence , and to the best of my knowledge he did not provide me with any such information . ''
1288 1579 Riady , who is deputy chairman of the Lippo Group , one of Indonesia 's largest and most respected conglomerates , also said Huang `` did not ask me to channel any money to America for the purpose of gaining influence for any foreign country in an American election , and I did not do so . ''
1580 1620 Huang once ran Lippo 's U.S. operations .
1621 1681 He served in the Commerce Department beginning in July 1994 .
1682 1890 After a Sept. 13 , 1995 , meeting between Riady and Clinton in the Oval Office , Huang moved over to the Democratic National Committee in December that year , where he raised money from Asian American donors .
1891 2051 The Senate committee said it had `` a single piece of unverified information '' that Huang may have a direct financial relationship with the Chinese government .
2052 2336 The draft report describes the alleged relationship between the Riady family and Chinese intelligence as `` based on business interests , '' with the Riadys obtaining Chinese assistance for international business opportunities `` in exchange for large sums of money and other help . ''
2337 2409 Riady spoke in his 21-story office building on the outskirts of Jakarta .
2410 2759 The ground rules of the interview prohibited questions on American politics or the family 's alleged links to Chinese intelligence , such as why the family contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to Clinton and the Democrats , and why Huang was in such frequent contact with his former employers at Lippo when he was at the Commerce Department .
2760 2801 The timing of his statement is important .
2802 2949 Riady , an ethnic Chinese , is trying to project a stable image for himself and his company at a time of economic and social upheaval in Indonesia .
2950 3055 Riady also would like to improve his image in the United States , a country he says he loved and admired .
3056 3291 But in the limelight he attracted in his 15 to 20 visits to the White House , including three to the Oval Office where he discussed policy matters with Clinton , he got a taste of American culture that he did n't bargain for , he says .
3292 3365 `` American values , I think I must say , have deteriorated , '' he said .
3366 3445 `` I think what you see in the television forms the image of what the truth is .
3446 3530 Actually what it has become is , the perception is more important than the truth . ''
3531 3681 So far the Senate panel 's allegations appear to have left the reputation of Riady and his father , Mochtar , as good businessmen intact in Indonesia .
3682 3827 Indeed , in a country like Indonesia , giving money to influential friends -- in this case President Clinton -- simply makes good business sense .
3828 4112 From his office , where several framed pictures of himself with Clinton decorate a bookshelf and desk , Riady portrayed the Lippo Group as one of Indonesia 's most durable companies , with an American-inspired dream of developing glittering shopping malls and residential communities .
4113 4226 `` We like to focus more on the vision that we have , and our eyes are still focused on that vision , '' he said .
4227 4332 `` We 're not quite like America yet , but obviously that becomes our target of what we 'd like to do . ''
4333 4387 It includes expanding business in China and elsewhere .
4388 4586 Lippo sources said business in China currently represents 5 percent of the company 's total assets , but company executives predict that in two or three decades that figure could grow to 30 percent .
4587 4681 `` We have always felt that China presents extremely good long-term prospects , '' Riady said .
4682 4724 `` But that 's what it is -- prospects . ''
4725 4941 `` In the short term there are lots of risks , volatility , as the government tries to shift and structure its economy from a basically state economy to more and more open economy and private enterprise , '' he said .
4942 5019 `` During that shift there 's a lot of uncertainties and a lot of volatility .
5020 5151 So what we try to do is try to look in the long term , but in the short term try to limit our investments to a manageable level . ''
5152 5272 Despite his dreams , Riady still has to deal with the short term , namely , wrestling with Indonesia 's economic crisis .
5273 5454 A $ 43 billion bailout by the International Monetary Fund is supposed to help get the sprawling archipelago back on its feet , but the government has been slow to implement reforms .
5455 5668 An acute money problem -- the local currency , the rupiah , has lost more than two-thirds of its value in the past eight months -- has many companies on the verge of bankruptcy because they ca n't pay their debts .
5669 5713 In this regard , Lippo has done fairly well .
5714 5792 Riady said that in the last two years the company has incurred no debt at all .
5793 5834 But there are cracks in the Lippo veneer .
5835 5990 Riady acknowledged that Lippo-owned banks had lost 10 percent of their deposits , and that the company 's retail business is down 20 percent to 30 percent .
5991 6163 Despite the overall economic problems plaguing Indonesia , and the resulting crisis of confidence , Riady still promotes the nation as `` the best place for investments . ''
6164 6251 And he says it is not true that personal connections determine success or failure here .
6252 6404 `` I think in any country connections are important because at the end of the day you want to know the policy directions of the government , '' he said .
6405 6544 `` So relationships and connections are important and are helpful , but I think it is unwise to base your business on those connections . ''
6545 6545 .
