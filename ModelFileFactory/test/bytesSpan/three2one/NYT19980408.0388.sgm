Times News Service dQC ; dLR ; dQL ; The National Endowment for the Arts has been described as embattled for so long that it now probably assumes this word is part of its name .
527 884 Since 1989 , when it financed exhibitions that included the infamous photographs by Robert Mapplethorpe and Andres Serrano defying conventional religious beliefs and sexual behavior , this agency has been hammered by politicians and pundits eager for a soapbox from which they can bemoan declining national values and inappropriate uses of government money .
885 1226 The NEA has been relentlessly attacked by conservative critics who believe that financing a broad spectrum of American artistic activities , including crafts and art made within communities that do not feel welcome in art museums , is emblematic of the erosion of quality and ambition in an increasingly multicultural , relativistic America .
1227 1452 If only the NEA would disappear , many opponents believe , the free-market system would do its thing , the cream would rise to the top , and art would once again look like the paintings of Richard Diebenkorn and Claude Monet .
1453 1633 As Bill Ivey , nominated by the White House to be the next chairman of the NEA , awaits confirmation hearings , what the endowment has been and can be are once again urgent issues .
1634 1823 If the NEA disappears , the pressure on the art world to see itself as part of a larger American picture will be sharply diminished , and the entire fabric of American art will be weakened .
1824 2111 The endowment is the only agency in the United States whose mandate is to build and maintain an arts infrastructure and to secure the place of the artist in society _ a society that before the agency was founded in 1965 was reluctant even to acknowledge that artists were real Americans .
2112 2272 It is the only agency that has been concerned with the totality of American art , including difficult and experimental work that challenges mainstream thinking .
2273 2544 In an American art world still largely identified with big institutions that can effortlessly slide into insularity and rampant self-interest , the endowment is the only agency whose existence argues for the importance of art to the creativity and dynamism of the nation .
2545 2744 Anyone who believes the endowment can be excised from the art world without seriously damaging American art should consider the repercussions of the radical changes within the agency in January 1996 .
2745 2942 After the Christian Right campaigned against the endowment and members of Congress promised to vote it out of existence , appropriations were cut from $ 162 million in 1995 to $ 99 million in 1996 .
2943 3166 Laying off roughly 45 percent of the staff meant that the endowment could no longer deal with the number of applications it had been receiving each year in disciplines like painting , sculpture , media arts and photography .
3167 3311 Individual artists ' grants , which had been the source of much of the punitive wrath that threatened the agency 's existence , were eliminated .
3312 3484 The endowment now awards grants in only four general categories : heritage and preservation , creation and presentation , education and access , planning and stabilization .
3485 3539 This restructuring has had far-reaching ramifications .
3540 3768 Once the endowment stopped giving grants to individuals , many small and large arts institutions stopped exhibiting any living artists who might make someone , somewhere , angry , and who were not widely acclaimed and collected .
3769 4000 After the endowment was publicly excoriated for having the temerity to award some of its money to art that addressed changing views of gender and race , many institutions lost the will to show any art that was rambunctious or edgy .
4001 4270 When the agency was deprived of its ability to accumulate comprehensive information about entire disciplines _ for example , 5,000 applications in painting alone were received each year _ arts professionals became less willing to take responsibility for art as a field .
4271 4399 The will to think big , to ask uncomfortable questions and to test informed and strongly held convictions is now largely absent .
4400 4547 The mission of the endowment was conveyed through the medium of public financing of the arts , with which the endowment remains largely synonymous .
4548 4746 To what and whom it awarded grants , and the political reception of these grants , inevitably influenced how state agencies used their money and how these agencies were treated by local politicians .
4747 4894 -LRB- As of January , 40 percent of the endowment 's funds go to the states in block grants , as opposed to 20 percent between 1975 and 1990 . -RRB-
4895 5128 Not only does the endowment now have much less money to give , but the very idea of public financing of the arts is now tainted by the microscopic scrutiny by Congress and the news media and by the specter of right-wing intimidation .
5129 5463 When arts professionals who came of age after 1989 think of public support for the arts , they do not think of the endowment 's 1965 mandate to `` help create and sustain not only a climate encouraging freedom of thought , imagination and inquiry , but also the material conditions facilitating the release of this creative talent . ''
5464 5530 For an entire generation , private sponsorship is the only option .
5531 5573 Private support can not meet this mandate .
5574 5826 The difference between private and public support was succinctly defined in a 1995 report to the President 's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities by Alberta Arthurs , then director of the arts and humanities division of the Rockefeller Foundation .
5827 6058 `` Private foundations , corporate and family foundations , '' she wrote , `` do their funding by guidelines and goals which are special to their interests and institutional purposes ; they fund to advance their corporate ideas . ''
6059 6372 In contrast , Ms. Arthurs continued , the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities -LRB- a more scholarly , academically oriented agency , also founded in 1965 -RRB- `` must support the whole , the diversity and debate of sectors , of ideas and talents , across the democracy .
6373 6455 ... They reach across disciplines ; they mobilize and leverage other resources . ''
6456 6684 In `` The Illusion of Private Giving , '' in The Washington Post last summer , Robert Storr , a widely respected curator of contemporary art at the Museum of Modern Art in New York , expressed his alarm at the current imbalance .
6685 6890 `` My work , '' he wrote , `` has taught me to have no illusions about how inadequate private giving _ however generous and at whatever level _ is to the great demands confronting cultural institutions . ''
6891 7146 After writing about the ferocious competition for funds in art museums and the increasing difficulty small and midsize institutions have raising private money , he concluded : `` There are no substitutes for government 's contribution to cultural affairs .
7147 7254 ... The coalition of support that has helped the arts to thrive in America is dangerously out of kilter . ''
7255 7449 It is important to keep in mind that there is no model for private support in the United States that indicates that it , by itself , could meet the demands of this or any future artistic moment .
7450 7686 Before the 1960s , when private patrons felt little or no pressure to consider the impact on art of public money , art was a significant but peripheral activity in the United States , and American art was almost entirely unknown abroad .
7687 7925 The market system ignored exceptional artists earlier in the century , including many African-Americans , and it still gives little support to many exceptional artists , particularly those who prefer to work outside galleries and museums .
7926 7970 Furthermore , private support is unreliable .
7971 8197 Corporate giving , which has been so crucial to the development of art institutions and blockbuster exhibitions , decreased between 1984 and 1994 ; its willingness to support difficult contemporary art can never be counted on .
8198 8335 To get a sense of the dangers of the current imbalance between public and private support , look at what has happened since January 1996 .
8336 8576 Arts organizations and museums have turned more to private foundations , many of which have been awarding large sums to programs that encourage arts institutions to engage audiences outside the familiar constituencies of these institutions .
8577 8653 At the same time , museums have come to rely on corporations more than ever .
8654 8836 Indeed , most big museums are so eager to attract and keep wealthy corporate board members that they are reluctant to do anything that might challenge corporate values and interests .
8837 8944 So even as museums are becoming , in theory , more democratic , they are looking and acting more corporate .
8945 9442 What is now largely missing from the contemporary art programming of the Modern , the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and the Whitney Museum of American art _ not to speak of the Metropolitan Museum of Art , which collects contemporary art but wants no part of the engagement with contemporary life that is proof of a genuine commitment to it _ is respect for the courage and imagination of living artists and an awareness of the needs of the field , two defining aspects of the endowment 's mission .
9443 9730 The widespread institutional fear of artists and of conflict , combined with the wish to please all present and future members and donors , helps explain why so many museums have come to seem like satellites of the entertainment industry , in which success is measured by popular appeal .
9731 10015 Clearly , private support , however visionary , can not persuade museums to fight for ways of thinking that challenge their immediate social and economic interests , and it can not persuade arts professionals to consider the art world as an ecosystem in which every part is connected .
10016 10060 Public support for the arts is also limited .
10061 10406 While the new endowment structure is responsive to art that fell through the cracks before , like projects designed to develop art programs in schools , hospitals or community centers , the new categories only reward art that promises to realize some kind of quantifiable social or institutional good , thereby keeping the agency out of trouble .
10407 10555 They do not allow it to support artists who want to explore technology , or their own psyches , or the relationship between the earth and the stars .
10556 10635 Just as important , the endowment can not liberate itself from self-censorship .
10636 10868 In 1990 , Congress voted to allow the National Council for the Arts , the endowment 's advisory committee _ whose members are political appointees _ for the first time to reject grants recommended by peer panels composed of experts .
10869 10974 Last December , Congress voted to include six of its own members on the council ; there were none before .
10975 11075 Self-censorship now infects the peer-panel selection process and indeed the entire endowment system .
11076 11162 It also infects the thinking of small and large arts organizations across the country .
11163 11223 For the health of American art , this weight must be lifted .
11224 11391 No solution is possible without reinventing the very American partnership of private and public support for the arts that has been a model other countries have envied .
11392 11605 It was indispensable to the flowering of American art in the 1960s and to the emergence of that art as a force on the international scene , communicating to the rest of the world that American culture had arrived .
11606 11640 This model must not be dismantled .
11641 11696 The endowment can continue to attend to infrastructure .
11697 11810 It can convene panels in which arts professionals from many disciplines and corners of the country work together .
11811 11919 With more money , it can be far more imaginative in the ways it approaches its broad and democratic mission .
11920 12150 It must trust artists again , perhaps by commissioning individual and also teams of artists _ including controversial ones _ to tour the country and speak with audiences , town-meeting style , about their ideas of artists and art .
12151 12404 The endowment can work to bring together rich patrons , whose tastes and interests are so instrumental in defining private support , with arts professionals from other social classes who may have very different ideas about what art is and who it is for .
12405 12472 All these interactions should be considered research and published .
12473 12621 In these and so many other ways , the endowment could help define as well as support the manifold meanings and possibilities of art in this country .
12622 12836 The private sector could establish and endow a private agency that gives grants to individual artists , as well as to the kinds of adventurous and experimental projects the endowment is now so reluctant to support .
12837 12959 This agency does n't have to be on the East Coast ; it could be based in Chicago , perhaps , or in Los Angeles or Houston .
12960 13045 It could give grants in both individual disciplines and interdisciplinary categories .
13046 13221 Like the endowment 's system , the awards could be made by peer panels of eight to 12 arts professionals from across the country , or it could invent another selection system .
13222 13451 These public and private agencies would always be aware of what each is doing and join forces at crucial moments _ at international exhibitions , for example , when American artists need to feel that their country is behind them .
13452 13498 Now is the time for the private sector to act .
