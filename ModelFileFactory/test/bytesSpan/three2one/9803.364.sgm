0 510 9803.364 NEWS STORY SOURCE : The Washington Post SECTION : A11 LENGTH : 933 DATE : March 10 , 1998 HEADLINE : Suharto Reelected President ; Indonesian Assembly Grants Leader New Powers Amid Unrest BODY_LEN : 879 JAKARTA , Indonesia , March 10 -LRB- Tuesday -RRB- - Indonesia 's legislature appointed President Suharto , Asia 's longest serving leader , to a seventh five-year term today after granting him sweeping new powers in the midst of the country 's worst economic and political crisis in three decades .
511 601 Suharto was elected by the largely appointed 1,000-member People 's Consultative Assembly .
602 849 The text of the `` special powers '' decree enacted by the assembly on Monday has not been made public , but political analysts say it likely draws on a similar measure , stemming from the upheavals of the 1960s , that was shelved a few years ago .
850 1054 Indonesia , the world 's fourth-most-populous country , with 200 million people , is suffering its worst turmoil since that turbulent period , and there have been mounting calls for Suharto to step aside .
1055 1336 `` There 's no way you can have political reform while Suharto is still in power , '' said one young activist leader who has been among thousands of university students demonstrating for political and economic reform in several cities since the assembly meeting began ten days ago .
1337 1465 He said protests will continue after the assembly ends on Wednesday , when Suharto is sworn in and the vice president is chosen .
1466 1534 Local newspapers reported that six students were arrested on Sunday .
1535 1676 Security forces have held back from intervening , despite a government ban on demonstrations and large gatherings during the election period .
1677 1942 In Washington , the crisis got an extraordinarily bleak assessment from Michel Camdessus , managing director of the International Monetary Fund , who voiced fears that Indonesia could drag down neighboring countries that have begun recovering from their own crises .
1943 2232 `` Even if you have the impression that we have made important progress in handling the Asian crisis , even if you are under the impression that Thailand and Korea have turned the corner , we are not there by far in Indonesia , '' Camdessus told a luncheon during an IMF-sponsored seminar .
2233 2303 `` If this problem is not solved soon , the whole thing is at risk . ''
2304 2488 Indonesia 's newly appointed armed forces chief has signaled he will be tough on protesters after demonstrations against high prices turned into riots in a number of cities last month .
2489 2602 `` If people are hot-tempered and ready to cut down the symbols of the state , yes , I will gladly prohibit them .
2603 2655 If they are still determined , I will be determined .
2656 2808 The difference is they are breaking the law , I am protecting the law , '' Reuters news agency quoted Gen. Wiranto as saying in Forum Keadilan magazine .
2809 2999 There has been speculation that the special-powers decree would allow Suharto to take a harder line against his opponents in the name of preserving national unity during the current turmoil .
3000 3028 But reformers are skeptical .
3029 3223 `` I do n't see the need of it because he has special powers already , '' said one Indonesian political analyst , who , like many government opponents these days , did not want to be identified .
3224 3371 Some analysts said the decree could allow the 76-year-old leader , who was ill late last year , to override the constitution in naming a successor .
3372 3459 Such a move would provide fodder for those who criticize the government as feudalistic .
3460 3626 After an outspoken and widely respected magazine last week ran a cover depicting Suharto as the King of Spades , the government took legal action against its editors .
3627 3864 The president 's children , who have wide-reaching and lucrative business interests in Indonesia , have increasingly taken on the role of spokesmen for the administration in the political vacuum leading up to the naming of a new cabinet .
3865 3995 The consultative assembly , which is largely appointed by Suharto , includes his relatives , friends and military representatives .
3996 4169 The political transition has been cited by officials from the IMF in explaining why they decided to delay the latest payment of the IMF 's $ 43-billion bailout of Indonesia .
4170 4288 Officials announced last week that the $ 3 billion slated to be paid on March 15 will be held up at least until April .
4289 4507 The IMF and Suharto have been locked in a standoff over the economic rescue package , with the West demanding a quick implementation of reforms and Suharto dancing around the measures he twice vowed he would carry out .
4508 4702 He also has been dangling the idea of pegging the Indonesian rupiah to the dollar -- a plan inspired by American economist Steve H. Hanke that the IMF and Washington have warned Jakarta against .
4703 5013 Both IMF and Indonesian officials sought today to play down their sparring -- which has roiled Southeast Asian markets -- following comments Suharto was quoted as making over the weekend that led some analysts to fear the president had dug in his nationalist heels and decided to reject the bailout altogether .
5014 5231 Jusuf Syakir , chairman of the Muslim-dominated United Development Party , emerged from a meeting with Suharto on Sunday announcing that the president said the IMF reforms were `` not in line '' with the constitution .
5232 5418 Specifically , Syakir quoted Suharto as saying , the reforms went against an article stipulating that the economy should be organized `` based upon the principle of the family system . ''
5419 5653 Few Indonesians , foreign businessmen or diplomats missed the irony in a statement coming from a president whose family has amassed more than $ 16 billion over the past three decades and helped inspire the term `` crony capitalism . ''
5654 5832 Today Bambang Trihatmodjo , one of Suharto 's tycoon children and a senior assembly member , said the IMF agreement might have to be renegotiated , the Associated Press reported .
