666 847 Chief Superintendent Al McHugh said the bomb discovered in the Irish Republic was destined for an unknown target in Northern Ireland and `` would have caused massive destruction . ''
848 1015 The discovery appeared to be the latest attempt by extremists opposed to the IRA 's 8-month-old truce to undermine the peace process , set to resume Monday in Belfast .
1016 1254 Extremists have bombed two predominantly pro-British Protestant towns and fired mortar shells at a police station since Sinn Fein was expelled from peace talks on Feb. 20 in punishment for two killings blamed on the Irish Republican Army .
1255 1417 Police found more than 1,300 pounds -LRB- 600 kgs -RRB- of fertilizer-based explosives Sunday in a shed in Dundalk , 50 miles -LRB- 80 kms -RRB- south of Belfast .

1586 1741 The British and Irish governments , which cosponsor the multi-party talks that are supposed to conclude by May , invited Sinn Fein to rejoin two weeks ago .
1742 1894 But Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams kept his party out pending meetings with British Prime Minister Tony Blair 10 days ago and President Clinton last week .
1895 1990 `` We were unjustly pushed out of the talks in February but we are back , '' Adams said Sunday .
1991 2148 He said the north 's substantial Catholic minority demanded a settlement that would promote Northern Ireland 's eventual unification with the Irish Republic .
2149 2224 `` Nationalists in the north are not a minority in someone else 's country .
2225 2405 We are Irish citizens , living in our own country , '' Adams said , adding : `` Nationalists want to move towards Irish unity and see this process as a bridge in that direction . ''
2406 2606 But the north 's pro-British Protestant majority is bitterly opposed to uniting Ireland and instead wants a strong government for Northern Ireland , which has been ruled directly by London since 1972 .
2607 2738 Northern Ireland 's biggest Protestant party , the Ulster Unionists , is threatening to push for Sinn Fein 's expulsion once again .
2739 2807 They say IRA commanders are responsible for the recent bomb attacks .

3145 3335 The crucible is Portadown , 30 miles -LRB- 50 kms -RRB- southwest of Belfast , where Orangemen march each July from their rural church back downtown _ through the town 's main Catholic area .
3336 3573 Protesters from several Catholic communities crowded into Portadown 's Catholic Garvaghy Road to hear speakers demand negotiations with Orange Order leaders , and pledge to participate in each others ' road-blocking protests this summer .
