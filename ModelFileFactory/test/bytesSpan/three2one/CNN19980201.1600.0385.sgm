128 157 Steve Nettleton takes a look .
158 290 To much of the world , the media feeding frenzy into the president 's alleged sexual affairs has become an international soap opera .
291 421 It has produced chuckles abroad from those who see it as another example of puritanical US moral values interfering in government .
422 459 Of course , the case goes beyond sex .
460 619 It involves criminal accusations of lying under oath and trying to cover it up , allegations often overlooked by readers and viewers outside the United States .
620 892 uh , I think they probably have a hard time uh making the distinction between the fact that on the one hand there is the sexual aspects of the scandal that are played up by the media , and on the other hand , the more serious charges of perjury and obstruction of justice .
893 991 But in many countries , the idea of even questioning a president about his sex life is ridiculous .
992 1125 Late French president Francios Mitterrand carried on a long affair with a former campaign volunteer and fathered a daughter with her .
1126 1186 Many in the French media knew about it , but kept it secret .
1187 1401 th - The people who did know ah choose not to report on it , because it was thought to be the private life of the president , and in no way had it anything to do with the way he was conducting the affairs of state .
1402 1523 In Japan , politicians ' sexual liaisons go largely ignored by the media and the public , as long as they are kept quiet .
1524 1588 But if they become headlines , they can be politically damaging .
1589 1753 In November , Japanese tabloids announced an alleged sexual affair between Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and a Chinese embassy employee in the nineteen eighties .
1754 1863 The tabloids called the woman a Chinese spy and suggested the relationship was a threat to national security .
1864 1935 Hashimoto denied the affair and it has had little effect on his office .
1936 1977 One of his predecessors was not so lucky .
1978 2176 Former Japanese Prime Minister Sousuke Uno resigned two months after taking office in nineteen eighty-nine following reports he had paid numerous hostesses called geishas to serve as his mistresses .
2177 2320 Even then , the Japanese were more shocked that Uno did n't keep his mistresses quiet and the geishas ' public complaints made him appear weak .
2321 2441 Can Bill Clinton survive the whirlwind of lurid sexual details and criminal accusations swirling around the Oval Office ?
2442 2565 International leaders will be watching carefully , wondering whether it will set a new precedent for politicians worldwide .
