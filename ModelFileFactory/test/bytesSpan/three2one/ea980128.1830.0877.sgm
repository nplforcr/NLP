0 155 ea980128 .1830.0877 NEWS STORY We 're going to take a closer look tonight at a real predicament which has come up as a result of the President 's problems .
156 287 What are the consequences when members of the Secret Service are asked to testify against the persons they are supposed to protect ?
288 524 As we reported earlier , the independent counsel Kenneth Starr will soon do just that , issue subpoenas to one or more Secret Service agents assigned to the White House who might have information about the President and Monica Lewinsky .
525 562 First , here 's ABC 's John McKenzie .
563 603 They are often visible but rarely heard .
604 692 They 're the ones with the ear pieces and the walkie-talkies at the President 's sleeve .
693 846 Secret Service agents are with him virtually everywhere he goes , not only at these public rallies , but in the privacy of his car or outside his office .
847 944 They are the President 's shadow , and whatever they see and hear is supposed to be confidential .
945 1064 You ca n't accomplish your job well unless you convince him that his uh his activities will be treated with confidence .
1065 1109 Secret Service agents have testified before .
1110 1212 During the Watergate investigation , agents answered questions about President Nixon 's taping system .
1213 1339 Agents also testified after the assassination attempt on Gerald Ford and , six years later , on the shooting of Ronald Reagan .
1340 1395 But it was never about a president 's private behavior .
1396 1591 Recently , a few agents volunteered to talk about life in the Kennedy White House , but only because they thought they were being asked to stand by while laws on prostitution were being violated .
1592 1647 It was the most elite assignment in the Secret Service .
1648 1759 And uh you were there watching an elevator or a door because uh the President was inside with with two hookers .
1760 1807 Fellow agents were outraged by the disclosures .
1808 1915 The director of the Secret Service , Lewis Merletti , issued a stern reminder to all three thousand agents .
1916 1989 Any aspect of the personal lives of our protectees has a negative impact .
1990 2040 This is a confidence that should continue forever .
2041 2185 But some now worry that confidence could be severely strained if agents are subpoenaed to testify about President Clinton and his personal life .
2186 2219 We do n't want to be politicized .
2220 2286 We do n't want to be caught in the middle of a political football .
2287 2339 And we would prefer to be left alone to do our jobs .
2340 2422 Secret Service agents already complain that it 's difficult to protect presidents .
2423 2538 If now forced to testify about the President 's personal behavior , they fear he would push them even farther away .
2539 2720 If we are are put into the th - the position where we 're we 're forced back from the President because he does n't trust us , then we 're putting the President 's life in jeopardy .
2721 2749 And that is not our mission .
2750 2807 Few doubt that , if subpoenaed , the agents will testify .
2808 2881 The question is whether a president has the legal authority to stop them .
2882 2918 John McKenzie , ABC News , New York .
2919 3029 So this is a difficult question whether Secret Service agents should be obliged to testify in a criminal case .
3030 3099 Joining us is Ronald Noble , professor of law at New York University .
3100 3255 Professor Noble , who used to be the Treasury Department official who supervised the Secret Service during at least one part of the Clinton administration .
3256 3388 First of all , your thoughts on how difficult it would be for their relationship with the President if they were obliged to testify ?
3389 3454 I think it would undermine their relationship with the President .
3455 3500 They 're required to maintain his confidence .
3501 3534 They 're required to protect him .
3535 3587 In order for them to do that , he has to trust them .
3588 3717 If they 're going to disclose confidences that they might have overheard or witnessed , he 's not going to be able to trust them .
3718 3805 But not just this president , every president and every visiting head of state as well .
3806 3907 Now , you just heard one Secret Service official say it is a confidence that should continue forever .
3908 3935 Do you really believe that ?
3936 3964 I really believe it , Peter .
3965 3985 I really believe it .
3986 4015 I 've talked to these agents .
4016 4055 I 've gone to funerals of these agents .
4056 4172 I can tell you that they care deeply about their job , and they care deeply about the mission of the Secret Service .
4173 4335 And if they 're required to be people telling confidences of the president , I think that confidence and that relationship is going to be undermined immeasurably .
4336 4456 Let me take up the other side , though , because it came up with the Secret Service agents looking after John F Kennedy .
4457 4491 They are law enforcement officers .
4492 4562 What if they are witness or become aware that the law has been broken ?
4563 4665 If they are witnesses to criminal activity , then they have an obligation to report criminal activity .
4666 4757 We 're not talking here about the allegations that they 're witnesses to criminal activity .
4758 4834 We 're talking about allegations that they 're witnesses to private conduct .
4835 4942 But that is less the issue when , for example , they might know , at the moment , this is all hypothetical .
4943 5047 They might know that the President has committed perjury by denying a relationship with Monica Lewinsky .
5048 5088 They might know that not to be the case .
5089 5109 What should they do ?
5110 5167 Yeah , but what we 're talking about here is speculation .
5168 5432 I mean , if we follow this to its logical conclusion , the independent counsel should be able to subpoena every Secret Service agent who 's ever protected the president at any point in time to see whether they heard or did n't hear or saw or did n't see something .
5433 5512 And I think it would just be a farce , and it 's something that we should stop .
5513 5705 I think someone 's got to draw the line and say we are not going to try to take down the institution of the Secret Service just simply to see whether or not we have an additional fact witness .
5706 5754 Professor Noble , thanks for your point of view .
5755 5765 Thank you .
5766 5817 Professor Noble , professor at New York University .
5818 5877 Back in a moment with the day 's other news and your money .
