Times News Service dQC ; dLR ; dQL ; STANFORD , Calif. _ It was fun while it lasted for the Harvard women 's basketball team .
392 573 The Crimson 's run in the NCAA tournament ended on Monday night with an 82-64 loss to Arkansas -LRB- 20-10 -RRB- in a second-round matchup at Maples Pavilion at Stanford University .
574 747 Wendy Willits , Arkansas ' freshman guard , nailed six 3-pointers -LRB- including five in the first nine minutes of the game -RRB- , one short of the NCAA tournament record .
748 857 Meanwhile , the senior point guard Christy Smith led Arkansas with 19 points while also recording 11 assists .
858 1005 So Harvard -LRB- 23-5 -RRB- is left to ponder the significance of its run and the possible long-term impact on both the Crimson and the Ivy League .
1006 1094 Defeating top-seeded Stanford in the first round was a truly remarkable feat by Harvard .
1095 1204 Not only had no 16th-seeded team ever defeated a No. 1-seeded team , but none had come closer than 32 points .
1205 1280 Maybe it was only a matter of time before an Ivy League team broke through .
1281 1409 After all , Dartmouth lost by only three points to Virginia in 1995 , when the Cavaliers were seeded third in the East Regional .
1410 1539 A year later , Harvard was within five points late in the second half against Vanderbilt , also seeded third and playing at home .
1540 1670 Arkansas coach Gary Blair , who was not short on hyperbole during the postgame news conference , was clearly impressed by Harvard .
1671 1717 `` Harvard is the American dream , '' he said .
1718 1788 `` It 's an indication to the rest of America to realize , ` We can . '
1789 1857 I 'm just as excited for Harvard as I was for my basketball team . ''
1858 1940 But Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith was a bit more restrained in her assessment .
1941 2007 `` Yes , it will certainly have an impact , '' Delaney-Smith said .
2008 2154 ` It will impact in that Allison Feaster and her senior classmates have left a legacy for the younger players to believe that anything can happen .
2155 2327 `` In the sense of changing the program _ attracting a higher level of players _ I doubt that because we are already competing with some of the top 10 programs for players .
2328 2367 Admissions is entirely out of my hands .
2368 2579 If I were to list some of the phenomenal players that we 're very interested in , one of two things happened : Their financial aid package did n't work for their family , or they were not admitted to Harvard . ''
2580 2738 But for Feaster , who lived up to her billing on a national stage , the tournament performance means a career in one of the two professional women 's leagues .
2739 2848 The senior forward , who finished with 2,312 career points , said she will pursue professional opportunities .
2849 2964 Feaster `` reminds me of a smaller version of Natalie Williams , who 's the best player in the ABL , '' Blair said .
2965 3060 `` She could be for women 's Ivy League basketball what Bill Bradley was for the men years ago .
3061 3142 Before she hits Wall Street , I hope she hits the pro leagues for a few years . ''
