0 47 ABC19980410 .1830.0074 NEWS STORY Good evening .
48 146 We begin tonight with one of those events in the category of things we thought we might never see .
147 375 We remembered today that after the Berlin Wall came down , after South Africa became a democracy and even the Arabs and Israelis had shaken hands , an end to what they call the troubles in Northern Ireland seemed remote at best .
376 461 The troubles may not be completely over , but they did make history in Belfast today .
462 690 At Stormont Castle today , Catholics , including representatives of the Irish Republican Army and their Protestant adversaries , have agreed to make peace after three decades of violence that took more than three thousand lives .
691 750 The former US Senator George Mitchell led the negotiations .
751 857 It does n't take courage to shoot a policeman in the back of the head or to murder an unarmed taxi driver .
858 917 What takes courage is to compete in the arena of democracy .
918 992 Northern Ireland has been part of Great Britain since nineteen twenty-one .
993 1276 Under today 's deal , it will be governed , at least in part , by an elected Northern Ireland Assembly in which Catholics and Protestants will share power , and a North South Council , meaning more cooperation between the North and the Republic of Ireland , the country to the south .
1277 1305 A lot remains to be settled .
1306 1429 The Catholic minority wants these to be strong institutions , to guarantee the rights they feel that they have been denied .
1430 1479 The Protestants want the institutions to be weak .
1480 1572 They believe that their interests are best served the more power that Great Britain retains .
1573 1669 No one , of course , discounts the chance that extremists on both sides will use violence again .
1670 1716 So the question is , will the agreement stick ?
1717 1795 Will this really be remembered as the day that peace came to Northern Ireland ?
1796 1835 In Belfast tonight , ABC 's Jim Wooten .
1836 1953 If Belfast 's ordinary folks seemed slightly less than jubilant today , certainly less excited than their newspapers .
1954 2012 Whether it comes through or not is a is a debatable point .
2013 2031 Do I feel hopeful ?
2032 2036 No. .
2037 2077 I I ca n't quite honestly say that I do .
2078 2167 Maybe they 've learned from their yesterdays not to expect too much from their tomorrows .
2168 2258 There were Good Friday prayers for peace , of course , from Protestants and Catholics too .
2259 2343 Such good people of such deep faith , it 's hard to believe their past is so savage .
2344 2388 It 's hard to forget , much less to forgive .
2389 2463 Seven thousand people have seen a member of their immediate family killed .
2464 2493 I mean , we 've had too much .
2494 2525 They had n't known life at all .
2526 2728 So at the White Fork Pub today , the cheers were mainly for soccer , not the promise of peace because There 's always going to be a small minority of people who will always want to keep the pot boiling .
2729 2861 Even though the mainstream Protestant and Catholic groups are parties to this agreement , a handful of killers could still wreck it .
2862 3022 That 's what happened in nineteen seventy-four when a similar power sharing arrangement , without Sinn Fein and the IRA , was attacked by Protestant hardliners .
3023 3078 God help those ladies and gentlemen who get in our way .
3079 3151 And replaced with years of violence today 's agreement is meant to stop .
3152 3237 The people of Northern Ireland will have to approve it , of course , in a referendum .
3238 3374 And with a Protestant majority , that is no sure thing , which may help to explain the absence of joy on the streets of this city today .
3375 3416 They have , after all , been here before .
3417 3466 I just pray to God that we can all live together .
3467 3491 Maybe , maybe they will .
3492 3524 Jim Wooten , ABC News , Belfast .
3525 3567 The negotiations lasted twenty-two months .
3568 3616 In the last session , thirty-two straight hours .
3617 3726 The man in charge of it all , the newsmaker here , was an American , former Senator George Mitchell of Maine .
3727 3746 You want me to sit ?
3747 3757 All right .
3758 3820 Do n't be deceived by his owlish appearance , say his friends .
3821 3848 The man is very determined .
3849 3930 George Mitchell left the Senate three years ago because he found it unsatisfying .
3931 4059 There was talk about being baseball commissioner , but the British prime minister knew his reputation as a master of compromise .
4060 4199 That and an Irish connection , Mitchell 's father is Irish , his mother Lebanese , soon landed him in the toughest imaginable negotiations .
4200 4358 These talks between Protestants and Catholics were often so contentious that one participant said he thought Mitchell might pack it in and go back to America .
4359 4425 For his part , he says he has never met nicer people in the world .
4426 4543 I have this absolute belief that everyone who has benefited has an obligation to do for others if that chance arises .
4544 4611 But he can come home now , this sixty-four year old man from Maine .
4612 4664 His young wife and a brand new baby boy are waiting .
4665 4805 The deal that Senator Mitchell has so successfully put together will be put to a vote in Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic next month .
4806 4806 .
