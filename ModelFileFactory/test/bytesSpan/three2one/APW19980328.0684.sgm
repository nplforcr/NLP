593 822 A multinational group of 20 diplomats , mandated by a U.N.-Iraq accord , accompanied the arms experts to the town of Tikrit , 25 kilometers -LRB- 15 miles -RRB- west of Auja , the village where Saddam was born on April 28 , 1937 .
823 962 `` We had no reports of any problems at this stage , '' Ewen Buchanan , the spokesman for the inspectors , said by telephone from New York .
963 1053 `` ` They will continue with their schedule for the next week and they are on schedule . ''
1054 1267 Saddam has one palace in Tikrit , one at Jebel Makhul , a mountain range some 50 kilometers -LRB- 35 miles -RRB- north of Tikrit and one near Tharthar lake , 50 kilometers -LRB- 30 miles -RRB- southwest of Tikrit .
1268 1373 It was not immediately known which one of those the inspectors visited or how long the inspection lasted .
1374 1510 State-run television on Saturday showed hundreds of villagers shouting slogans of support for Saddam as he visited villages near Tikrit .
1511 1624 In a speech , the Iraqi leader made no mention of the current searches , which state-run media have also ignored .
1625 1746 The palaces are among the eight that Iraq had long kept off-limits from weapons inspectors , citing national sovereignty .
1747 1876 When Iraq refused to relent , the United States and Britain threatened military strikes , raising the specter of war in February .
1877 2008 The crisis was averted when Iraq signed an accord with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Feb. 23 , pledging to open the palaces .
2009 2156 In return , the United Nations appointed the group of 20 diplomats to accompany the inspectors to all sensitive sites to safeguard Iraq 's dignity .
2157 2239 The palace inspections began Thursday with the Radwaniyah complex outside Baghdad .
2240 2374 The total area of the eight palace compounds is 31.5 square kilometers -LRB- 12.5 square miles -RRB- , which comprise 1,058 buildings .
2375 2562 The diplomats and the inspectors in Tikrit also are expected to travel to Mosul , the site of another palace 400 kilometers -LRB- 235 miles -RRB- from Baghdad during their three-day trip .
2563 2601 They will return to Baghdad on Monday .
2602 2751 Tikrit , 170 kilometers -LRB- 105 miles -RRB- from Baghdad , is the heartland of Iraq 's ruling elite , which is dominated by minority Sunni Muslims .
2752 2974 Earlier Saturday , the diplomats plus their leader , Jayantha Dhanapala of Sri Lanka , drove from their downtown hotel to the U.N. headquarters to team up with the arms experts at their office before leaving for the north .
2975 3184 On Friday , a minor surveying problem snagged the inspection but it was sorted out after talks between the U.N. team and Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz , Antonio Montiro , a Portuguese diplomat , said .
3185 3213 `` Everything went smoothly .
3214 3266 Even when we had the problem , we were able to talk .
3267 3316 That 's why things were solved , '' Montiro said .
3317 3417 The inspectors ' leader , American Charles Duelfer , stressed that it was n't a significant problem .
3418 3687 The inspectors must certify that Iraq has dismantled its long-range missile program and its programs to build chemical and biological weapons before the U.N. Security Council will consider lifting the economic sanctions it imposed after Iraq 's 1990 invasion of Kuwait .
3688 3733 The sanctions have strangled Iraq 's economy .
3734 3885 Iraq has insisted that has complied with the U.N. resolutions and that any banned weapons have been destroyed and the programs to build them abolished .
