0 360 9806.71 NEWS STORY SOURCE : The Washington Post SECTION : A21 LENGTH : 631 DATE : June 26 , 1998 HEADLINE : N. Ireland Votes on Its New Assembly ; 108 Chosen Will Form 1st Locally Elected Government in 26 Years BODY_LEN : 614 BALLEYMONEY , Northern Ireland , June 25 - Ian McCartney helped make history in Northern Ireland today -- but he did n't find it easy .
361 523 `` It 's just a wee sheet of paper they give you , '' the gray-haired chicken farmer said as he emerged from the voting booth at Balleymoney Model Primary School .
524 590 `` But do n't you know , it 's a complicated thing to work out . ''
591 892 McCartney and the other 1.2 million eligible voters in this war-torn British province were voting this rainy day on the 108 members of a brand new Northern Ireland Assembly , which will take over local government powers here as part of the new peace plan designed to end decades of sectarian violence .
893 1010 The assembly will give a locally elected government to Northern Ireland for the first time in a quarter of a century .
1011 1185 The last local parliament was disbanded in 1972 when the British government concluded the Protestant majority was using it to legalize discrimination against Roman Catholics .
1186 1258 Counting was to begin Friday , with results not expected until Saturday .
1259 1399 The `` complicated thing '' facing voters is an electoral system called `` Proportional Representation With the Single Transferable Vote . ''
1400 1596 Common in Europe , it 's a voting mechanism designed to ensure the elected assembly accurately reflects the wide range of choices available in a jurisdiction with many competing political parties .
1597 1718 Twelve parties , plus a cross section of independent candidates , were on the ballots in the 18 assembly districts today .
1719 2067 The `` wee sheet of paper '' required voters to allocate their support among an alphabet soup of parties generally known by their initials : the D.U. P , the P.U. P , the U.U. P , the U.D.P. Five parties represent different strains of the position known here as `` unionist '' -- that is , those who want to retain the political union with Britain .
2068 2098 Most unionists are Protestant .
2099 2315 Two major parties represent the `` nationalist '' position -- those who want to break the tie with Britain and form a single nation with the Republic of Ireland , which makes up the southern two-thirds of the island .
2316 2347 Most nationalists are Catholic .
2348 2406 The other parties are so-called cross-community groupings .
2407 2632 Some represent specific interests , such as the environmentally minded Green Party , and some were created to overcome the sectarian divisions that have sparked street warfare and terrorist murder over the past three decades .
2633 2809 As a reminder of those old animosities , a large car bomb exploded Wednesday in the small village of Newtownhamilton , injuring a half-dozen people and wrecking homes and cars .
2810 2936 Today , though , voters turned out in large numbers in Newtownhamilton to demonstrate that they prefer the ballot to the bomb .
2937 3020 Voters got one vote each -- but each vote could be split among numerous candidates .
3021 3235 All the candidates in each district are listed on the ballot , and voters are asked to rank them in order of preference -- first choice , second choice and so on , all the way down to 23rd choice in some districts .
3236 3431 The choices are then allocated among the various contenders in such a way that the six assembly members to be chosen from each district will reflect the range of preferences among the electorate .
3432 3527 `` It 's a tricky business , '' McCartney said after spending 15 minutes distributing his vote .
3528 3597 `` You have to give some help to parties you do n't normally support .
3598 3665 You know , that keeps out the one you 're absolutely opposed to . ''
3666 3747 For some voters in this green , rolling farm district , the choices were simpler .
3748 3899 Balleymoney is in the North Antrim district , the electoral home of a fiery Protestant leader , the Rev. Ian Paisley , who opposes the peace agreement .
3900 4094 Several people leaving the primary school said they had simply marked Ian Paisley and his son , Ian Paisley Jr. , as their first and second choices -- and ignored every other name on the ballot .
