0 82 CNN19980518 .2130.0603 NEWS STORY New York Yankee fans are celebrating perfection .
83 162 Pitcher David Wells threw a perfect game against the Minnesota Twins yesterday .
163 273 Gary Tuchman reports , Wells is sometimes better known for his off the field antics than his athletic ability .
274 457 Inside the New York Yankee souvenir stores in New York City , there are jerseys of Yankee legends like Ruth and Gehrig , and current Yankee stars like Knoblauch , Cone , and Williams .
458 549 But the stores do n't regularly carry the jersey of the man who just made baseball history .
550 744 David Wells is the fifteenth pitcher in nearly one hundred thirty years of major league baseball to get a perfect game , which means none of the twenty-seven batters he faced reached first base .
745 806 A remarkable sporting feat by a man who grew up a Yankee fan .
807 883 You know it 's just something that , ah , you know you have to cherish this .
884 950 And , eh - it really has n't sunk in , because I 'm still nervous .
951 970 I 'm still shaking .
971 1090 Coincidentally , Wells went to the same California high school as the only other Yankee pitcher to hurl a perfect game .
1091 1196 That was Don Larsen , who did it during the nineteen fifty-six World Series against the Brooklyn Dodgers .
1197 1272 Wells , who will turn thirty-five this week , is considered a good pitcher .
1273 1404 But perfect is not a word used to describe a man who has a history of being a bit rebellious and , to put it kindly , a bit portly .
1405 1459 But those facts make him more of a hero for many fans .
1460 1520 He 's sort of unusual looking guy for a pitcher , is n't he ?
1521 1562 But , ah , he can come up with the goods .
1563 1767 I think the fact that he just shows you that a party kind of guy can go out , you know , maybe the night before , doing whatever he 's doing , and come the next day and pitch a no hitter , a perfect game .
1768 1883 He 's had his fights in the past with the boss , Yankee owner George Steinbrenner , but Wells says he is who he is .
1884 1976 Sometimes I just do n't give a crap what , you know , what people say an - and what they do .
1977 2045 I just , you know , worry about my job and what I 'm supposed to do .
2046 2113 So is it time for the Yankee stores to reorder David Wells jerseys ?
2114 2134 Oh yes , definitely .
2135 2207 We 've already had a lot of questions for David Wells merchandise today .
2208 2290 In the meantime , all the stores ' TV monitors are providing perfect game replays .
2291 2333 A perfect game is an incredibly rare feat .
2334 2453 But by virtue of pitching one , David Wells now has the chance to do something even rarer , back-to-back perfect games .
2454 2478 That has never happened .
