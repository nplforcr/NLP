515 681 Officials with the Croatian oil company INA said the move was done for economic reasons , but it is likely to erode already-tense relations between the two neighbors .
682 759 Bosnia 's state-owned oil company , Energopetrol , owes INA dlrs 3.8 million .
760 853 Friday , INA confiscated 30,000 tons of oil and oil products it had provided to Energopetrol .
854 950 The Bosnian company had not paid for the products stored in the southern Croatian port of Ploce .
951 1097 `` This was done suddenly , without any negotiations , discussions or warning , '' said Aziz Tukulj , director of domestic sales for Energopetrol .
1098 1154 `` My personal feeling is that this is pure bullying . ''
1155 1228 Energopetrol owes money to INA , Tukulj said , but was n't sure how much .
1229 1312 He added that INA owes money to Energopetrol and its parent company , Energoinvest .
1313 1412 He said contracts between the two companies require negotiations be undertaken to resolve disputes .
1413 1485 A spokesman from INA could not be reached to confirm Tukulj 's comments .
1486 1616 INA recently announced that it would start punishing debtors because unpaid bills totaling dlrs 141 million threaten its business .
1617 1727 Some debtors , like Croatia 's electric-power industry , airline and railway , promised to pay up immediately .
1728 1830 It is doubtful whether Bosnia , whose economy is in ruins after a devastating war , can pay its debts .
1831 1896 Tukulj said the confiscation will not create shortages in Bosnia .
1897 1951 But the move is likely to have political consequences .
1952 2128 Bosnia 's Muslim-led leadership was outraged by a recent speech by Croatian President Franjo Tudjman , in which he justified his support for the wartime Bosnian Croat substate .
2129 2234 Bosnian leaders , as well as international officials , are leery of Tudjman 's intentions towards Bosnia .
2235 2331 They interpreted his remarks as an indication of his continued desire to annex a part of Bosnia .
2332 2437 In addition , the two countries have failed to agree on terms for Bosnia to lease part of the Ploce port .
2438 2537 The confiscation by INA `` looks like some kind of -LRB- political -RRB- pressure , '' Tukulj said .
