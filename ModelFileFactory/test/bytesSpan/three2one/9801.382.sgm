538 691 The agreement , signed Aug. 1 , permits the United States to supply ammunition , vehicles , and communication and navigational equipment to the military .
692 824 They were to be used to fight drug trafficking in a specific geographic area that includes most of the southern half of the country .
825 1064 But because of the army 's poor human rights record in the past decade , the United States made its help conditional on the Colombian military 's human rights performance and established a joint vetting process for units receiving the aid .
1065 1372 The agreement says the Colombian government is to provide semiannual certification to the U.S. Embassy `` regarding any ongoing formal investigations or prosecutions , or any penalties applied , with respect to gross violations of human rights by any member of the units operating in the designated area . ''
1373 1550 The aid was expected to total about $ 37 million in fiscal 1998 , but U.S. officials said the delays in designating and vetting the units could mean less aid would be disbursed .
1551 1744 Aid to the Colombian military was formally cut off in 1996 , after the U.S. government , for the second year in a row , said Colombia had failed to cooperate fully in fighting drug trafficking .
1745 1929 The second failure to be certified triggered the cutoff , but President Clinton issued a waiver allowing aid to resume after an agreement was reached on how and where it would be used .
1930 1985 Colombia is one of the world 's most violent countries .
1986 2158 Guerrillas in the longest-running Marxist insurgency in the hemisphere are battling the army , as well as the right-wing paramilitary organizations that it often tolerates .
2159 2233 All sides are involved , to varying degrees , in the lucrative drug trade .
2234 2368 According to news service reports , at least 24 people were killed yesterday and Thursday in attacks by guerrillas and paramilitaries .
2369 2525 Guerrillas reportedly attacked a remote police post in the northern province of Magdalena , killing two policemen , a 3-year-old girl and a 17-year-old boy .
2526 2563 A guerrilla was also reported killed .
2564 2671 And in a rash of four attacks in the northwest , paramilitary groups killed nine people , the reports said .
2672 2812 While U.S. aid to Colombia is supposed to fight drug trafficking , the military can use it in areas where the leftist guerrillas are active .
2813 2967 The likelihood that U.S. funds would be used for the counterinsurgency campaign made the U.S.-Colombian agreement controversial within the administration .
2968 3147 The navy and air force -- unlike the army -- moved quickly to name and vet their units , and have received several million dollars in aid , according to U.S. government officials .
3148 3190 But most of the aid was to go to the army .
3191 3294 Officials said they were unable to determine exactly how much money had gone to the navy and air force .
3295 3401 `` The army is not adequately vetting its units at this time , '' said a U.S. official monitoring the aid .
3402 3539 `` They did give us a list of units to receive aid , but it was so confused , we had to send it back to them and ask them to clean it up .
3540 3616 That was just before Christmas , and we hope to hear back from them soon . ''
3617 3763 Another U.S. official said the Colombian army had difficulty finding any units without serious human rights violations , thus slowing the process .
3764 3831 `` The question is , is there anyone we can deal with out there ? ''
3832 3851 the official asked .
3852 3910 `` There are so many problems ; it is very complicated . ''
3911 4160 Fidel Cano , a spokesman for the Colombian Embassy here , acknowledged the delays in compiling the army 's information but said putting together such data as who belongs to what unit and which human rights investigations are underway is complicated .
4161 4288 `` Our Ministry of Defense is working very hard with the U.S. Embassy in Bogota to get the information together , '' Cano said .
4289 4373 `` We are giving it a high priority ; it is not something that we have forgotten . ''
4374 4374 .
