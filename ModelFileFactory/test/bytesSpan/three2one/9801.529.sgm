0 638 9801.529 NEWS STORY SOURCE : The Washington Post SECTION : C02 LENGTH : 547 DATE : January 01 , 1998 HEADLINE : AMSC to Buy Electronic Messaging Firm ; Reston Company to Be Major Supplier of Mobile Data-Service Devices BODY_LEN : 528 American Mobile Satellite Corp. announced yesterday that it will purchase Motorola Inc. 's electronic-messaging business , known as Ardis , for $ 100 million in stock and cash , a move that would make the Reston company one of the country 's largest suppliers of mobile data-service devices to professionals who are frequently out of their offices but need to stay in touch with dispatchers and managers .
639 752 The acquisition combines two companies with complementary technologies that now serve disparate business sectors .
753 938 Under terms of the deal , Motorola would become AMSC 's second-largest stockholder , with close to 20 percent of the company , said Gary Parsons , president and chief executive of AMSC .
939 1124 Ardis , which covers more than 425 cities in North America , uses radio towers to provide data messages to mobile business users -- for example , copy machine or elevator repair people .
1125 1289 AMSC , meanwhile , uses satellites to provide both voice and data message services to people who work in outlying areas , including truck drivers and boat captains .
1290 1414 The acquisition is contingent on government regulatory approvals and is expected to close in the first quarter of this year .
1415 1515 If the deal is approved , AMSC said its emphasis would shift to data , rather than voice , services .
1516 1675 AMSC anticipates that more than 80 percent of its revenue would come from data services , and close to 90 percent of its customer base would use such services .
1676 1720 The split is now about 50-50 , Parsons said .
1721 1913 `` This seems like a good strategic fit for AMSC in that it will give them ubiquitous service , '' said Robert Kaimowitz , a satellite industry analyst for C.E. Unterberg , Towbin in New York .
1914 2077 But Kaimowitz declined to comment on whether he believes AMSC is paying a good price for Ardis , which he projects will have revenue of about $ 38 million in 1997 .
2078 2138 The deal 's impact on AMSC 's earnings is unclear , he said .
2139 2295 AMSC has lost money consistently in recent quarters , reporting losses of $ 80.2 million in the first three quarters of 1997 , on revenue of $ 30.3 million .
2296 2386 AMSC stock closed yesterday at $ 7 a share , up 6Ê1\/4 cents , on the Nasdaq Stock Market .
2387 2494 Motorola 's stock also was up 6Ê1\/4 cents a share to close at $ 57.18 3\/4 on the New York Stock Exchange .
2495 2624 Yesterday 's announcement solidifies what had already been a close working relationship between the two companies , Parsons said .
2625 2737 He said the companies had relied on each other 's technology when users moved out of their normal coverage area .
2738 2826 From a consumer standpoint , nothing would change in the new arrangement , Parsons said .
2827 2860 No new equipment would be needed .
2861 2975 While he said the acquisition would allow AMSC to reduce costs , he expects no decrease in the prices of products .
2976 3057 He said it is premature to say what management or branding changes would be made .
3058 3256 Ardis 's land-based division would continue working at the company 's Lincolnshire , Ill. , headquarters , he said , with its satellite services based in Reston ; there are no plans for any layoffs .
3257 3482 Albert Lopez , director of communications for Motorola 's messaging information and media sector , said the acquisition would enable the company to focus on developing consumer products , including cellular phones and pagers .
3483 3542 `` These are the things Motorola is known for , '' he said .
3543 3543 .
