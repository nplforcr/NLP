0 133 ea980119 .1830.0555 NEWS STORY This is the first day that drivers can have switches installed to turn off the air bags in their cars .
134 288 The option is being made available after some children were killed by air bags , and some adults feared the air bags would do more harm than good to them .
289 315 Here 's ABC 's Lisa Stark .
316 476 Sixty-three hundred people have applied for the cutoff switches and more than five thousand of them , including Alice Featherstone , have already been approved .
477 575 Surprisingly , more than half of the requests are for switches to disable driver 's side air bags .
576 662 From people like Featherstone , worried about sitting too close to the steering wheel .
663 799 If that thing comes out at two hundred miles an hour and my face is right here , um it 's going to snap my neck , I think , like a twig .
800 930 Only twenty-four percent of the approvals are for just passenger side switches , primarily in cases where kids must ride up front .
931 1105 But many dealers and mechanics are refusing to install the switches , worried about getting sued if someone turns off an air bag and then is injured or killed in an accident .
1106 1237 This is a situation where the customer controls our liability with the flip of a switch , and we 're not willing to take that risk .
1238 1296 So far , only Ford and General Motors have switches ready .
1297 1357 Installing them will cost two to three hundred dollars each .
1358 1411 But drivers will have to search for someone to do it .
