0 105 ed980121 .1130.0562 NEWS STORY Most scientists say childhood is the best time to learn a second language .
106 175 Researchers wanted to know why , so they watched the brain in action .
176 248 Ann Kellan reports , the differences between young and old are dramatic .
249 352 Can only be a hundred and forty Myla Ryava moved to the United States from Bulgaria when she was three .
353 390 Learning English for her was a cinch .
391 477 The answers could be fifty , the answer could be thirty and the answer could be forty .
478 500 Take your best answer .
501 543 Myla 's parents are having a tougher time .
544 600 ea - It 's h - hard to learn English after thirty years .
601 671 Why is it generally more difficult for adults to learn a new language ?
672 754 Researchers at Sloan Kettering Cancer Center are starting to answer this question .
755 883 Using a machine called a functional MRI , they monitor the brain activity of twelve volunteers who speak more than one language .
884 976 Some learned a second language as children , while others learned in high school or college .
977 1086 -LRB- -LRB- NS -RRB- -RRB- Anne Merkich , a study volunteer learned to speak Croatian and English as a child .
1087 1137 She helps demonstrate how the study was conducted .
1138 1241 Once the MRI scanner is turned on , she will watch some slides and is told to think about the pictures .
1242 1278 First in English , then in Croatian .
1279 1315 I thought , oh , good morning , sun .
1316 1372 You know , what a wonderful day we had ah - ahead of us .
1373 1447 No matter what language Anne used , the same spot in her brain was active .
1448 1488 Yellow is Croatian , and red is English .
1489 1548 And you see in this area , they 're completely overlapping .
1549 1622 That was n't the case when people learned another language later in life .
1623 1733 Those who learned a second language as teenagers use a separate area of the brain to process the new language .
1734 1842 It teaches us that the brain does different things with uh a late language as compared to an early language .
1843 1979 The results of this study are already having an impact in the way brain surgeons perform , and , more importantly , prepare for surgery .
1980 2057 These are the areas of activation that are responsible for speech production .
2058 2108 This bright white area here is where the tumor is .
2109 2211 Then brain surgeons try to avoid the language centers of the patient 's brain when removing the tumor .
2212 2320 Do you think now is a good time for you to learn a language or do you think you should wait a little longer ?
2321 2422 -LRB- -LRB- NS -RRB- -RRB- These students prove it by singing a Japanese song they learned last year .
2423 2537 -LRB- -LRB- NS -RRB- -RRB- Scientists say they still do n't know when is the best time to learn a second language .
2538 2632 They eventually hope to answer that question , by more study on how the brain learns language .
