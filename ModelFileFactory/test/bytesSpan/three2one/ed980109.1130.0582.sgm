1815 1899 Ollie , Ollie , Could he be a serious contender for the GOP presidential nomination ?
1900 2035 North has a core of dedicated supporters who 'd probably lie in front of a locomotive for him , but uh he does n't have enough of them .
2036 2171 uh There are n't enough in the party , there are n't enough in the Republican primaries to make him a a serious presidential contender .

2670 2712 I 'm not talking about the big PAC checks .
2713 2765 I mean , I had a very small average dollar donation .
2766 2842 It was less , I think , than twenty dollars , if you go back and look at it .
2843 2956 Two hundred and fifty thousand donors around the country who contributed to a twenty-two million dollar campaign .
