0 79 CNN19980405 .1000.0591 NEWS STORY World-class skiers say balance is everything .
80 149 Now a new device is helping skiers save precious time going downhill .
150 225 Rick Lockridge reports , it also helps nonskiers freeze pain in its tracks .
226 267 Going for his fiftieth world cup victory .
268 404 For world cup skiers like Alberto Tomba , the difference between winning and finishing back in the pack is often a single , thin second .
405 475 Now this is a different slalom course than they have used in the past .
476 484 Or less .
485 562 At this level , the slightest edge in speed and balance can crown a champion .
563 610 While the tiniest technical flaw can be costly .
611 634 Out of the race course .
635 818 Seeking that tiny but decisive competitive edge , many of Italy 's Olympic skiers come here to the laboratorio alto prestazione , the high performance lab , in Santa Caterina , Italy .
819 882 What they 're asked to do here literally makes their jaws drop .
883 987 Changing the bite is just one of many modes that you can use to help you to eliminate the interferences .
988 1044 And this silver and green box is what finds the problem .
1045 1139 It 's the lizard med scale , a scale that measures precisely where your weight is distributed .
1140 1193 It can show you exactly where you 're out of balance .
1194 1357 When world cup downhiller Pitro Vitialini steps on the scale , it shows him to be several pounds heavier on the right side of his body , as shown by the red lines .
1358 1494 A decision is made to give Pitro a custom mouthpiece , in the hope his jaw will line up properly , and the rest of his body will follow .
1495 1515 We adjusted my bite .
1516 1570 And in effect , I improved my performance quite a bit .
1571 1602 And so I believe in the system .
1603 1662 Athletes are n't the only ones affected by body imbalances .
1663 1689 Ordinary people are , too .
1690 1698 Hold it .
1699 1706 Resist .
1707 1717 Very good .
1718 1870 Chiropractor Alfio Caronti says the lizard med scale allows patients to see for themselves the alignment problems that are causing their pain or injury .
1871 1950 So , the scale has been uh helping to show that uh w - we 're seeing the truth .
1951 2002 Open the lizard med scale and you find six sensors .
2003 2023 Three for each foot .
2024 2119 The sensors feed data into a software program which can actually calculate the body 's posture .
2120 2340 Green readouts indicate good balance , yellow means you 're on the border , and red means you 're really out of It 's not like I get on that scale , they tell me what 's wrong , and all of a sudden , I 'm a better skier .
2341 2472 But the information that I get allows me to achieve better balance , and if I can continue to maintain that balance , I ski better .
2473 2624 Someday soon , even ordinary skiers and nonskiers may find themselves standing on the green lizard like marks that give this promising device its name .
