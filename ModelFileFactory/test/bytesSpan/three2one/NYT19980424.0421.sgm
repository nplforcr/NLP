Times News Service dQC ; dLR ; dQL ; The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday , April 25 : The Supreme Court took a detour this week from the core principle of gender fairness it vindicated two years ago in its ruling invalidating the use of sexual stereotypes to justify denying women admission to the Virginia Military Institute .
597 805 By a 6-3 vote , the court upheld a discriminatory immigration law that gives a child born overseas to an unmarried American woman a better chance at citizenship than a child born to an unmarried American man .
806 917 Under the statute , a child born abroad to an unwed American mother is automatically considered a U.S. citizen .
918 1122 But the child of an unwed American father has no citizenship rights unless the father takes the affirmative step of acknowledging paternity and formally agrees to provide support until the child turns 18 .
1123 1344 The majority 's views were expressed in three separate opinions , the most disquieting of which was written by a liberal member , Justice John Paul Stevens , and joined by a conservative , Chief Justice William Rehnquist .
1345 1575 The opinion , which found the gender distinction reasonable , relied heavily on outmoded generalities about family roles , including the flawed presumption that mothers have a closer relationship to their children than fathers do .
1576 1863 As Justice Stephen Breyer asked in a strong dissent , `` what sense does it make '' to apply citizenship barriers `` only to fathers and not to mothers in today 's world _ where paternity can readily be proved and where women and men both are likely to earn a living in the workplace ? ''
1864 1990 Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Anthony Kennedy seemed to agree that the law amounted to unconstitutional sex discrimination .
1991 2234 But instead of providing the votes to strike it down , they chose to uphold it on the flimsy ground that because the sex of the parent and not the child made the difference under the law , the plaintiff did not have standing to bring the case .
2235 2329 The Justice Department , which supported the statute , did not cover itself with glory either .
2330 2527 The department retreated from its position in the VMI case when it argued that the government could not make policy based on stereotypes `` even when those stereotypes reflect current realities . ''
2528 2727 As for the court , it managed with its splintered ruling to cast doubt both on the constitutionality of the immigration provisions it upheld and on its true commitment to fighting gender stereotypes .
