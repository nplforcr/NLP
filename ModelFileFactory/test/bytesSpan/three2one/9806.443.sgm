0 492 9806.443 NEWS STORY SOURCE : The Washington Post SECTION : A16 LENGTH : 1371 DATE : June 03 , 1998 HEADLINE : Chinese Ex-Official Challenges Party ; Bao Tong Tests Commitment to Rule of Law BODY_LEN : 1417 BEIJING , June 2 - Four days after police told him his political rights had been restored , the most senior Chinese Communist Party official jailed for political reasons in two decades launched a broadside tonight against the party for failing to undertake significant political reform .
493 836 In an interview , Bao Tong , who was arrested May 28 , 1989 -- just days before soldiers and tanks crushed student-led protests in Beijing 's Tiananmen Square -- challenged Communist Party officials to prove their commitment to the rule of law by letting him speak his mind after spending seven years in prison and two more under restrictions .
837 1084 `` My goal is to be a very good Chinese citizen , a Chinese citizen with the right to speak his mind , '' said Bao , 65 , who was chief of staff , speech writer and senior political adviser for ousted Premier and Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang .
1085 1141 `` I am ready to take my ideas and speak out about them .
1142 1292 Free speech is a very important contribution to building China , and I believe my freedom of speech will be protected by law and by the government . ''
1293 1434 Bao , who was made a scapegoat for the upheaval that threatened the control of the Communist Party , said , `` I want to test their promises .
1435 1499 So if I meet any problems , it shows their promises are fake . ''
1500 1674 But in a note of realism about government security surveillance and the cautious pace of political change in China , Bao said , `` I hope that my telephone works for a while .
1675 1713 I hope that my family has no problems .
1714 1755 I hope that I do n't have an accident . ''
1756 2039 Though less well known internationally than recently released dissidents like student leader Wang Dan , who led protests for democracy in 1989 , or veteran dissident Wei Jingsheng , Bao has much more influence in China , especially within the top ranks of the ruling Communist Party .
2040 2335 He was a member of the party 's powerful organization department in the 1950s and 1960s , jailed and sent to the countryside during the Cultural Revolution of 1966-76 , and then returned to the core of people around senior leader Deng Xiaoping in 1977 when China 's economic reform period began .
2336 2612 He later became a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party and was the point man for political and economic reforms under Zhao that deemphasized ideology and were aimed at transforming China 's centrally planned economy into one more responsive to market forces .
2613 2745 `` I am still proud that I was a party member , '' Bao said , `` but the Chinese Communist Party has done a lot of stupid things . ''
2746 2890 His comments come amid signs that influential party members are debating political reform more openly than at any time since the 1989 crackdown .
2891 3080 Some voices outside the party also are calling for a reevaluation of the party 's verdict on the suppression of the 1989 demonstrations , which ended in the deaths of hundreds of civilians .
3081 3217 Bao was riding on a train back to Beijing from the countryside in 1977 when he heard a radio broadcast that Deng had been rehabilitated .
3218 3282 `` I had a great deal of hope in Deng , '' Bao recalled tonight .
3283 3360 `` I thought in the beginning he could become a great man in Chinese history .
3361 3436 Unfortunately , during June 4 -LRB- 1989 -RRB- , he blackened his own face .
3437 3460 No one did this to him .
3461 3481 He was too powerful .
3482 3503 He did it to himself .
3504 3545 That , I think , is a tragedy for him . ''
3546 3664 Bao blamed the Communist Party for thinking it could undertake economic reforms without significant political reforms .
3665 3777 He said that the party should have embraced political change at the time of the Democracy Wall movement in 1979 .
3778 3922 Instead Deng used the movement to crush his leftist rivals , then turned on the movement and jailed its most prominent advocate , Wei Jingsheng .
3923 3976 `` This was the biggest lesson '' of 1989 , Bao said .
3977 4027 `` I was very active in pushing political reforms .
4028 4070 But I should have pushed for them earlier .
4071 4181 From as soon as we smashed the Gang of Four , just when the Democracy Wall was up , we should have started . ''
4182 4378 The Gang of Four , which included the widow of Mao Zedong , and which orchestrated the Cultural Revolution , lost out to a more `` moderate '' faction in the power struggle following Mao 's death .
4379 4684 Bao said the failure to act sooner on reforms has created a country with a weak legal system that risks repeating mistakes of the Cultural Revolution , when millions of people were killed or exiled to the remote countryside in a decade of intraparty strife , and of the Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989 .
4685 4860 He linked the party 's bouts of what he called `` madness '' with a concern that as China grows more powerful , it could prove a destabilizing force in Asia and world affairs .
4861 4932 China `` has already gone mad twice in the last 40 years , '' Bao said .
4933 5017 `` You have to ask yourself a question : What will it do on the international scene ?
5018 5083 Is it a source of stability or a potential source of instability ?
5084 5153 When it does n't have enough power , its attitude will be restrained .
5154 5274 But once it develops and becomes strong , what kind of role is it going to play without a complete structural change ? ''
5275 5467 Bao said China should adopt a system of multiparty democracy and said that the Chinese Communist Party should model itself on American political parties and be more responsive to its citizens .
5468 5609 `` If we ca n't do a multiparty system now , we can still start to work within the party to have a free discussion of opinions , '' Bao said .
5610 5754 Though Bao was expelled from the party when he was officially sentenced in 1992 , he noted that the ousted premier Zhao is still a party member .
5755 5837 `` If he could publicize his views about June 4 , that would be an improvement . ''
5838 6091 Zhao , who was the second of Deng 's proteges to be ousted and who preceded current party chief Jiang Zemin , lost his post after he appeared in Tiananmen Square in May 1989 to express sympathy with the students and to plead with them to leave the site .
6092 6147 He lives in Beijing under a loose form of house arrest .
6148 6293 During the party congress last October , he sent a letter to party leaders in an unsuccessful attempt to get them to reassess the events of 1989 .
6294 6473 Though many officials and scholars blame the students for provoking the government crackdown through their recalcitrance , Bao said the prime responsibility was the government 's .
6474 6560 `` As a party member and official , my mistakes were bigger than theirs , '' Bao said .
6561 6710 `` Even if the students made 100 mistakes , it still was n't equal to what the government did to them in sending the military to shoot at the people .
6711 6751 There 's no way you could compare it . ''
6752 6938 Bao , who joined the party underground during the 1940s when he was a high school student , had worked with Zhao on economic and political reforms for 10 years at the time of his arrest .
6939 7115 He was held incommunicado for nearly three years in Beijing 's Qincheng Prison , before he was officially sentenced for allegedly leaking state secrets to the student movement .
7116 7192 Bao said that his treatment showed the absence of true rule of law in China .
7193 7431 A State Council report written by then-Beijing party chief Chen Xitong -LRB- now in jail on corruption charges -RRB- accused Bao of leaking word to the students that martial law would be imposed and advising them about how to confront it .
7432 7507 But at his trial in 1992 , no mention was made of those charges , Bao said .
7508 7603 Bao 's imprisonment violated one of the unspoken rules Deng made after the Cultural Revolution .
7604 7773 That rule was : If you 're a senior party official and lose a power struggle , you lose your job but you do n't go to jail the way people did in the Cultural Revolution .
7774 7829 Bao is the only exception to that in the past 20 years .
7830 7887 Bao had no severe complaints about his treatment in jail .
7888 8049 But he said he was denied medical treatment after his release in 1996 when he was confined to a workers ' dormitory in a western suburb of Beijing for 11 months .
8050 8171 About a year ago , Bao was allowed to leave the dormitory on condition that he not return to his home in central Beijing .
8172 8265 He now lives in a six-room apartment in western Beijing , near the famous Babaoshan cemetery .
8266 8382 He lives on his stipend from the Communist Party and his wife 's pension , a combined income of about $ 170 a month .
8383 8475 He says he passes his time doting on his wife and playing with his 9-year-old granddaughter .
8476 8534 `` She 's unruly , unlike some Chinese girls , '' he said .
8535 8574 `` Unfortunately , she has my genes . ''
8575 8575 .
