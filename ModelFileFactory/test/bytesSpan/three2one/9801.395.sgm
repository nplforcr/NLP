364 614 The purchase , which was approved by the boards of both companies , marks the first major effort by new ATdT Chairman C. Michael Armstrong to revive ATdT , which has been slow to react to mounting threats to its core long-distance telephone business .
615 938 `` It 's an indication that Mike Armstrong is serious about local competition and serious about getting moving , '' said Anna-Marie Kovacs , an analyst for the brokerage firm Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. `` ATdT and Teleport are going after the business market , which is where local companies make a lot of their money . ''
939 1082 The deal also will give three major cable television companies , which are majority owners of Teleport , a collective 10 percent stake in ATdT .
1083 1241 By acquiring Teleport , ATdT can offer business customers local and long-distance telephone service , and data and Internet access , under its own brand name .
1242 1402 Using Teleport 's local facilities , the company also would be able to reduce the fees it pays to local phone companies for access to local telephone customers .
1403 1534 `` It 's going to permit us to be much more cost-effective as we go for that local business , '' Armstrong said at a news briefing .
1535 1593 `` This has competition and growth written all over it . ''
1594 1637 ATdT is paying for Teleport with its stock .
1638 1842 Teleport shareholders will receive 0.943 ATdT shares for each of their Teleport shares , putting the deal at $ 59 a share based on ATdT 's closing price yesterday of $ 62.62 1\/2 a share , up $ 2.62 1\/2 .
1843 1900 Teleport closed down $ 3.62 1\/2 at $ 54.12 1\/2 a share .
1901 2006 The companies expect the deal , which must be approved by regulators and shareholders , to close by fall .
2007 2218 Teleport , based in Staten Island , N.Y. , leads a new breed of local phone competitors that are invading urban markets to grab the most lucrative business customers from the regional Bell companies , GTE Corp. .
2219 2253 and other dominant local carriers .
2254 2347 The company is not yet profitable , but is expected to post revenue of $ 500 million in 1997 .
2348 2552 Teleport is the largest independent `` competitive local exchange carrier , '' with fiber-optic phone networks in 66 local markets nationwide , including Washington , Baltimore , New York and Los Angeles .
2553 2663 Its major shareholders include cable giants Tele-Communications Inc. , Comcast Corp. and Cox Enterprises Inc. .
2664 2818 The deal would collectively give those cable firms a 10 percent stake in ATdT , which raises new possibilities for ATdT and the cable television industry .
2819 2925 Cable operators , for example , could begin providing ATdT-branded Internet access over their cable lines .
2926 3028 ATdT also may one day offer Internet-based telephone service to customers through their cable service .
3029 3190 `` I would n't be surprised if we saw further talks between ATdT and cable , '' said Brian Adamik , an analyst for the Boston-based consulting firm Yankee Group .
3191 3250 `` Let 's face it , there are only two wires into the home .
3251 3306 The whole issue of cable-telephone could rise again . ''
3307 3385 Armstrong would not comment on possible future alliances with cable operators .
3386 3625 One of his first moves upon taking the job in October , after leaving his post as chairman of Hughes Electronics Co. , was to sell ATdT 's investment in Hughes 's DirecTV unit , the cable industry 's chief direct-broadcast satellite rival .
3626 3823 Teleport Chairman Robert Annunziata , 49 , a 17-year ATdT veteran who left in 1983 to form Teleport , will become an executive vice president of ATdT and head up the company 's local services unit .
3824 3960 Companies such as Teleport have been posing the only significant competition to the regional Bells and other local telephone incumbents .
3961 4270 WorldCom Inc. has the largest presence in urban competitive phone routes through its 1996 purchase of MFS Communications Co. for $ 14 billion in stock , and its 1997 acquisition of Brooks Fiber Properties Inc. for $ 2.4 billion , announced on the day WorldCom made its bid to acquire MCI Communications Corp. .
4271 4540 ATdT has had trouble breaking into the $ 110 billion local telephone market despite the Telecommunications Act of 1996 , which required the Bells and other local carriers to make their local phone lines and equipment available for leasing and connection by competitors .
4541 4681 Residential competition has remained elusive , largely because it 's too expensive for rivals to build their own facilities into every home .
4682 4862 Instead , ATdT and other rivals had hoped to lease phone lines from the Bells and other local carriers , but are engaged in a battle with the Bells over the prices for such access .
