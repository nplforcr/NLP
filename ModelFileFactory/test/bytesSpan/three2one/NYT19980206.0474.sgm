Times News Service dLR ; dQC ; dQL ; NEW YORK _ One by one , thousands of people made the sign of the cross Friday night as they walked by the open casket of a man they never met but came to love by laughing at his jokes every morning for the past four years .
552 653 `` He was a member of the family , '' said Carmen Rodriguez , a 43-year-old secretary from the Bronx .
654 677 `` More than that even .
678 717 The one person we listened to everyday .
718 745 We 'll miss him greatly . ''
746 849 They had come pay their respects to Junior Hernandez , one of the most popular radio hosts in the city .
850 1097 Hernandez died of a heart attack Wednesday afternoon , as he walked by the Harley Davidson Cafe at West 56th Street , just outside the WSKQ-FM studios where every morning he broadcast his popular show , `` El Vacilon de la Manana , '' Morning Jam .
1098 1131 He was 34 and had chronic asthma .
1132 1303 Since his death was announced by a colleague shortly after it happened , the station , also known as Mega 97.9 , has been inundated by grieving fans , his colleagues said .
1304 1457 Friday night , mourners lined up for hours outside the Ortiz Funeral Home in the Bronx just to catch a glimpse of a man they only knew through his voice .
1458 1633 They came as far away as New Jersey and Connecticut and included a cross section of New Yorkers , everybody from Benito Rodriguez , a retired cook , to Mayor Rudolph Giuliani .
1634 1770 Police officers controlling the crowd estimated late Friday night that as many as 12,000 people had filed by Hernandez 's golden casket .
1771 1791 `` Why , why him ? ''
1792 1914 a woman cried as she hugged a friend , who tried to console her by telling her that Hernandez had gone to a happier place .
1915 1932 `` It 's destiny .
1933 1982 It 's destiny , '' he kept repeating to no avail .
1983 2122 Hernandez 's show was the second highest-rated in the city , according to the most recent Arbitron ratings , trailing only Howard Stern 's .
2123 2292 And , like Stern 's , Hernandez 's trademark was his ability to make his audience laugh at jokes so crass that many of his fans did not dare to repeat them Friday night .
2293 2484 `` I remember well the last joke he made , but I ca n't tell you , '' said Teresa Diaz , 73 , who came from Puerto Rico one month ago and already called herself a fan and friend of Hernandez .
2485 2543 `` What I can tell you is that he always made me laugh . ''
2544 2680 Hernandez played an instrumental role in making WSKQ-FM the third highest-rated station in the city in the most recent Arbitron ratings .
2681 2806 By helping improve his station , he brought recognition to the growing Spanish-language radio industry , his colleagues said .
2807 2918 `` Junior was one of the pillars of the station , '' said Julio Vergara , programming assistant at the station .
2919 2985 `` His knowledge and passion for his audience made him special . ''
2986 3119 In New York , and everywhere else in the United States where large Hispanic communities have settled , radio plays an important role .
3120 3196 Hispanics immigrants come to this country with a special affinity for radio .
3197 3370 It is from radio , not from television , where Latin Americans have traditionally gotten their news of the day , weather updates , entertainment , music , and even the time .
3371 3470 Hernandez 's show , which runs from 6 to 10 a.m. , mixed all those elements , plus off-color humor .
3471 3546 Like many morning shows , it included crank calls , parodies and sex jokes .
3547 3720 With his irreverent , sometimes vulgar talk , Hernandez won fans all over the city , especially young men and women with an affinity for crass language and fast-paced music .
3721 3819 Vergara said the show will continue with Hernandez 's co-host , Luis Jimenez , and two assistants .
3820 3901 Colleagues from the station said Jimenez was too distraught to go to the service .
3902 3951 At the service Friday night there were few tears .
3952 4086 Standing on a ever-longer line that snaked its way through four blocks , most people laughed as they remember Hernandez and his jokes .
4087 4256 `` I ca n't cry because that is not what he would have liked , '' said Yamila Reinoso , 18 , a college students who arranged her class schedule around Hernandez 's show .
4257 4331 `` My days were not complete if I did not listen to him in the morning . ''
4332 4439 Hernandez , who was born in Puerto Rico , started working at a radio station there right after high school .
4440 4642 His cousin , Migdalia Martinez , said Hernandez missed his high school graduation ceremony because he had already been hired as a DJ and was scheduled to go on the air the very same day of the ceremony .
4643 4740 Ms. Martinez said that it had never occurred to Hernandez to be anything other than a radio host .
4741 4810 `` Radio and music , those were his loves and his life , '' she said .
4811 4910 In 1985 , Hernandez moved to New York , working for several stations before he joined WSKQ in 1993 .
4911 4975 He had been co-host of `` El Vacilon de la Manana '' since 1994 .
4976 5045 His only dream was to have his own radio station , Ms. Martinez said .
5046 5132 `` If he saw this outpouring of love tonight , he would be really proud , '' she said .
5133 5212 There were people in line in wheelchairs , holding babies , supported by canes .
5213 5239 One woman was on crutches .
5240 5356 A man from Patterson , N.J. , Jose Rolon , drove an hour and a half and stood in line two hours to pay his respects .
5357 5434 He was two hours late for the 81st birthday party of his wife 's grandmother .
5435 5478 `` My wife is going to be mad , '' he said .
5479 5595 But Rolon , a 43-year-old postal worker , said he could not miss the opportunity of give Hernandez a final good bye .
5596 5640 `` He always made me feel good , '' he said .
5641 5773 When Hernandez 's casket was taken from the funeral home to a white hearse , thousands of people lurched forward chanting `` Junior !
5774 5784 Junior ! ''
5785 5814 Some threw flowers and notes .
5815 5848 Several waved Puerto Rican flags .
5849 5928 Hernandez 's body was flown to Puerto Rico , where his ailing parents await it .
5929 6039 He will be buried in a family plot in Vega Baja , a small town to the north of the island , far from his fans .
