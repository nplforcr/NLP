456 693 The official , speaking on condition of anonymity , claimed the Burmese troops are holding their ground about five kilometers -LRB- three miles -RRB- inside Thailand at the Tong Na village in Pang Ma Pa district of Mae Hong Son province .
694 803 The Burmese are claiming the right to be there on the basis that the area has yet to be demarcated , he said .
804 942 He said about 100 of the Burmese troops have been on Thai soil since Tuesday and 400 more troops have crossed over to Thailand since then .
943 1170 A Thai army official in the area , however , dismissed the incident as `` minor , '' insisting that only several dozen Burmese troops had `` accidentally '' crossed over on Wednesday but that Thai soldiers had pushed them back .
1171 1318 He said he had sent more troops to monitor the situation , as requested by provincial authorities , and insisted that everything was under control .
1319 1417 Thai officials often downplay incidents of border tension to avoid diplomatic wrangles with Burma .
1418 1619 Although Thai-Burmese relations are generally good , disputes over the demarcation of the border , as well as the presence of Burmese ethnic minority guerrillas , has led to a number of confrontations .
1620 1867 The border official said the Burmese troops were planning to attack guerrillas of the Shan State Army troops from Thai territory and forced civilian refugees , who are about two kilometers -LRB- one mile -RRB- from the border , to return to Burma .
1868 2026 He said the Thai army had requested help from border patrol police and some paramilitary Ranger units , who arrived in the area with mortars and machine guns .
2027 2085 Several helicopters have been requested as well , he said .
2086 2260 Fighting between government troops and the Shan State Army broke out about a week ago inside Burma near the city of Homong , the former headquarters of opium warlord Khun Sa .
2261 2387 Khun Sa , also known as Chang Qifu , surrendered to the Burmese government in 1996 and is now thought to be living in Rangoon .
2388 2558 When Khun Sa surrendered , Burma 's military government said most of his 10-15 ,000 ethnic Shan troops had laid down their arms and the area was under government control .
2559 2689 But recently , three separate Shan rebel armies announced they were joining forces to continue the war against the Burmese regime .
2690 2868 The renewed guerrilla war has been a setback for the military government in Rangoon , which has touted ceasefires with many ethnic insurgent groups as one of its accomplishments .
