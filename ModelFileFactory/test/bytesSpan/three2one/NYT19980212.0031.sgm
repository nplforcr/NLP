Times News Service dLR ; dQC ; dQL ; NEW YORK _ During intermission , a woman seated in the row behind me said that she had known the Capeman himself _ Salvador Agron , the Puerto Rican gang member who killed two teen-agers in 1959 and who is the subject of Paul Simon 's troubled new musical .
591 685 `` I knew him , '' she said , in a way that made it clear she only wished she had known Agron .
686 828 Then she and her friend , contemplating the embers of the first half of `` The Capeman , '' began to try out synonyms for the word `` flat . ''
829 984 There was a moment of hopefulness as the curtain rose for the second half , but soon I could smell grief emanating from the Marquis Theater all over again .
985 1213 Nearly everyone in the audience felt bad for Simon and his `` Capeman '' collaborators , Mark Morris and Derek Walcott , but not half as bad as we felt for the actors onstage , for Ruben Blades , Marc Anthony and Ednita Nazario .
1214 1230 What went wrong ?
1231 1264 That is the question , naturally .
1265 1496 By the time previews have run their course , as they had when I saw `` The Capeman , '' the question comes far too late _ too late , even , for Jerry Zaks , who had been brought in a few weeks earlier to try to rebalance the story .
1497 1592 But by then , everyone had been shackled to a beast whose destiny they could no longer control .
1593 1688 One of the figures who staggers through this musical is St. Lazarus , played by Nestor Sanchez .
1689 1816 His arrival , the audience eventually deduces , coincides with moments of revelation or crisis in Salvador Agron 's inner life .
1817 1942 I wish that instead of St. Lazarus it had been the philosopher Aristotle who roamed about the stage dispensing enlightenment .
1943 2242 Here is what he might have said , as he said it in his `` Poetics '' some 2,300 years ago : `` Tragedy is not a representation of men but of a piece of action , of life , of happiness and unhappiness ... and the end aimed at is the representation not of qualities of character but of some action . ''
2243 2370 And Aristotle adds , `` Moreover , you can not have a tragedy without action , but you can have one without character-study . ''
2371 2449 This , it seems to me , is a fair account of why `` The Capeman '' goes wrong .
2450 2665 Instead of a piece of action _ a determining event in the life of the hero _ this musical gives us the entire biography of Salvador Agron , from his birth in Mayaguez , Puerto Rico , to his death at 43 in the Bronx .
2666 2862 In fact , `` The Capeman '' insists on the wholeness with which it presents Agron 's life by bringing the grown-up , redeemed Agron , played by Blades , onstage with his delinquent younger selves .
2863 2942 This is a musical in which all the action has been replaced by character-study .
2943 3053 The result is that the actors have nothing to do , and neither does the audience , except to sit on its hands .
3054 3220 Simon 's music , so fragile melodically and so unwilling in `` The Capeman '' to surrender itself to the Latin and pop rhythms it evokes , only compounds the problem .
3221 3351 The songs are the place for character to emerge , but the lyrics , co-written by Derek Walcott , are usually narratives , stories .
3352 3447 They actually replace the action that should be developing onstage instead of complementing it .
3448 3599 On its own , the music is moving , especially so because the wonderful voices of Blades , Anthony and Ms. Nazario intertwine onstage from time to time .
3600 3634 But the music is never on its own .
3635 3727 It is always hampered by the demands of the acting , the stage presentation , even the sets .
3728 3811 Soon it becomes clear that what Simon has written is not a Broadway musical at all .
3812 3959 He has written what should be an oratorio , a musical drama presented , as the dictionary says , `` without stage action , scenery , or costume . ''
3960 4046 There is only one actor for Paul Simon 's songs , and that has always been Paul Simon .
4047 4291 When he sings `` I was born in Puerto Rico , '' as he does on the CD called `` Songs From The Capeman , '' you understand that he is enjoying the license a song lyric creates , the singer 's ability to falsify his nature as he makes true music .
4292 4403 The songs from `` The Capeman '' sustain just that much pretense , the transposing of Simon 's character alone .
4404 4628 But when Ruben Blades sings `` I was born in Puerto Rico '' as `` The Capeman '' gets under way _ trying to lift the plot into life _ you feel that the burden of creating dramatic belief among the audience is just too great .
4629 4728 Agron does not stir from his grave , not for Lazarus , not for Aristotle , not even for Paul Simon .
