393 777 dLR ; dQL ; dUR ; -LRB- JT dLR ; -RRB- dQL ; dUR ; By RICHARD W. STEVENSON dLR ; dQC ; dQL ; dUR ; c. 1998 N.Y. Times News Service dLR ; dQC ; dQL ; WASHINGTON _ The economy created jobs at a surprisingly robust pace in January , the government reported on Friday , evidence that America 's economic stamina has withstood any disruptions caused so far by the financial tumult in Asia .
778 903 The Bureau of Labor Statistics said the economy added 358,000 jobs last month , far above the 235,000 forecast by economists .
904 989 It was the third consecutive month that job generation has been exceptionally strong .
990 1171 With growing opportunities for work drawing more people into the labor force , the unemployment rate remained at 4.7 percent last month , just a notch above its quarter-century low .
1172 1246 The demand for workers also led employers to raise wages again last month .
1247 1340 Average hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory employees rose 4 cents , to $ 12.51 .
1341 1519 The gain left wages 3.8 percent higher than a year earlier , extending a trend that has given back to workers some of the earning power they lost to inflation in the last decade .
1520 1618 But economists said the wage increase was not enough to raise any concerns about higher inflation .
1619 1899 And because the Federal Reserve has made clear that it expects the economy to slow in coming months as ripple effects from Asia reach the United States , investors disregarded the large jobs gains , betting that neither a rise in interest rates nor resurgent inflation is looming .
1900 2055 Stocks rose , pushing the Dow Jones industrial average up 72.24 points , to 8,189.49 , leaving the index within 70 points of its record high set on Aug. 6 .
2056 2236 In the bond market , a sensitive barometer of inflation anxiety , prices edged up , pushing down the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond to 5.92 percent from 5.93 percent .
2237 2358 `` Job creation is sturdy and we have effective price stability , '' said Paul McCulley , an economist at UBS Securities .
2359 2417 `` The bottom line is that we 've got a lovely economy . ''
2418 2671 With potential inflation counterbalanced by worries about possible price declines , the Fed and its chairman , Alan Greenspan , have suggested that they intend to keep interest rates unchanged until the economy tilts clearly in one direction or another .
2672 2815 The job figures for January extended a surge in employment gains that began last fall , just when the labor market had showed signs of cooling .
2816 3085 After accounting for a small downward revision Friday to December 's figures , the economy has been creating jobs at a rate of 358,000 a month for the last four months _ and 381,000 over the last three months _ after averaging 242,000 for the first nine months of 1997 .
3086 3186 The surge in jobs reflects a remarkable confluence of positive and self-reinforcing economic forces .
3187 3277 Inflation has been almost nonexistent , and consumer confidence has been extremely strong .
3278 3433 After a short , sharp drop when Asia 's financial problems first became clear , the stock market has rebounded and corporate profits have remained healthy .
3434 3543 Long-term interest rates , an important indicator of economic stability , have fallen in the last few months .
3544 3758 Lower rates have helped invigorate housing and other interest-sensitive sectors of the economy by making loans more affordable , and have allowed companies to continue investing heavily in more efficient equipment .
3759 3872 The likelihood that the federal budget will soon move from deficit into surplus has further improved the outlook .
3873 3962 The less money the government needs to borrow , the more is freed for private investment .
3963 4034 President Clinton welcomed the job figures at a news conference Friday .
4035 4224 His advisers said the results reflected not just from balancing the budget , but also initiatives like improved access to education and training and the opening of foreign markets to trade .
4225 4410 `` There are enormous economic and social benefits from our nation 's high-employment economy , '' said Janet Yellen , the chairwoman of the White House 's Council of Economic Advisers .
4411 4519 Some of the biggest employment gains came in the construction industry , which added 92,000 jobs in January .
4520 4676 The increase reflected the strength of the housing industry , which has been helped not just by declining interest rates but also by unusually warm weather .
4677 4848 Service industries also showed solid job gains , as did manufacturers , two areas expected to be hardest hit when the effects of the Asian crisis hit the American economy .
4849 5096 The major harm from Asia is likely to come from the plunge in the value of many Asian currencies relative to the dollar , a situation that is expected to lead to a surge of inexpensive imports into the United States , hurting American competitors .
5097 5201 And the weakness of the Asian economies is also likely to lead to decreased demand for American exports .
5202 5309 `` The economy has been running on the fumes of the strength from before the Asia shock , '' McCulley said .
5310 5431 `` Those fumes will exhaust themselves , and the manufacturing sector is going to start getting beat up in the spring . ''
5432 5594 The figures showed the unemployment rate for adult men declined to 3.8 percent last month from 4.1 percent in December , the lowest figure for almost two decades .
5595 5654 The rate for adult women rose 0.4 percent , to 4.4 percent .
5655 5772 For the first time , the Labor Department broke out unemployment by education level as well as gender , age and race .
5773 5861 The analysis showed unemployment rates dropped steadily with higher levels of education .
5862 5952 Among people with less than a high school education , the rate in January was 7.2 percent .
5953 6046 Among high school graduates , the rate was 3.9 percent , and college graduates , 1.9 percent .
