375 415 Starting Wednesday you can also buy yen .
416 534 In recent days , clerks in its stores have been learning to convert dollars to yen , and brushing up on their English .
535 684 `` It 's difficult to predict how many people we will get '' for the foreign exchange business , said Tatsuhiko Asaka , an executive with Bic Camera .
685 752 `` Possibly 50 or 60 customers a day , but I do n't really know . ''
753 886 Wednesday is the official start of `` Big Bang , '' Japan 's program to deregulate its strictly controlled financial markets by 2001 .
887 1008 Bic Camera is just one of countless companies that will jump into businesses that for decades were closed to them by law .
1009 1189 The aim is to open up the country to global capital , drawing in foreign banks and securities firms to transform Tokyo into a vibrant financial center to rival New York and London .
1190 1379 At the same time , officials hope , it will strengthen Japan 's many faltering financial institutions and help them stoke an economy that has been locked in stagnation for much of the '90s .
1380 1566 Over time , the shifts could encourage Japan 's people to send abroad more of the estimated $ 10 trillion that they hold in personal savings and financial assets , many analysts believe .
1567 1728 Masaru Takagi , an economics professor at Meiji University in Tokyo , predicts that in 10 years , about 10 percent of Japan 's savings will be invested overseas .
1729 1773 Others believe things will move more slowly .
1774 1893 `` I do n't expect to see a significant change as of April 1 , '' said Mitsuru Saito , market economist for Sanwa Bank .
1894 2021 Over time , Japanese may begin to shift to overseas investments , Saito said , `` but capital will not just be flowing one way .
2022 2067 It will be flowing into Japan as well as out .
2068 2193 Particularly now -- with more foreign interest in buying Japanese real estate and companies , foreign money could flow in . ''
2194 2327 The latest steps build on changes enacted last year that made it easier for Japanese to buy mutual funds , both foreign and domestic .
2328 2410 For instance , mutual fund companies were allowed to sell their products in banks .
2411 2488 In December , U.S. firm Fidelity Investments set up booths in numerous banks .
2489 2624 Analysts and bankers say sales have been slow , but Fidelity officials responded that they viewed the effort as an educational process .
2625 2687 Fidelity is launching its own phone sales operation Wednesday .
2688 2812 One reason many analysts predict a gradual change is the generally conservative investment attitude of the typical Japanese .
2813 3083 In a report issued today , the Bank of Japan found that during October and December of last year , as the Japanese stock market headed down , investments in mutual funds fell by 16 percent and stock holdings fell by 22.6 percent , while cash on hand grew by 7.9 percent .
3084 3174 Shozo Yamane , a 73-year-old sake brewer , said he is not interested in risky investments .
3175 3260 He said the stock and currency markets are a game `` only younger people should play .
3261 3313 At my age , I can not afford to make such a loss . ''
3314 3437 Investment advisers say that they have been surprised by the amount of interest from people in their twenties and thirties .
3438 3612 `` I 'm thinking of dabbling in it myself , '' said Hiroko Ohta , a 28-year-old reporter for the popular weekly magazine Shukan Josei , which is aimed at the twentyish crowd .
3613 3761 The current issue strayed from its usual fare of articles on celebrity romances and modeling tips to feature a story by Ohta entitled : `` Big Bang .
3762 3806 All It Takes Is 10 Minutes to Understand . ''
3807 3915 `` I 'm always interested in doing something trendy , so now I am interested in mutual funds , '' Ohta said .
3916 4043 Fidelity , Merrill Lynch and other U.S. institutions have said they expect to do well in the emerging freewheeling environment .
4044 4253 Indeed , a survey by a major Japanese institution found that a significant percentage of people said they planned to increase transactions with Citibank , while cutting their business with many Japanese banks .
4254 4372 When asked what banks they intended to use most , Citibank ranked second , surpassed only by Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi .
4373 4518 The Big Bang phase that begins Wednesday will remove many foreign exchange controls , allowing money to flow more freely across Japan 's borders .
4519 4632 It will lift controls on commissions on securities trades of more than $ 385,000 , to encourage more competition .
4633 4720 It will let anyone get into the cur rency-changing business , with no license required .
4721 4875 If fully carried out over the coming three years , Big Bang would turn on its head many of the principles that guided Japan 's postwar financial industry .
4876 5087 For years , the government divided up the market , letting certain types of institutions do only certain types of business -- for instance , trust banks could manage pension funds , but ordinary banks could not .
5088 5170 Countless types of simple transactions required a bureaucrat 's stamp of approval .
5171 5328 The government maintained that this ensured order and stability in a crucial economic sector that took in savings and provided capital for export industries .
5329 5490 Now , the prevailing view is that the protections have created weakness and dependency , while foreign banks and brokerage houses have become lean and efficient .
5491 5657 All over Japan , banks and finance companies are holding hundreds of billions of dollars of bad loans left from the collapse of the `` bubble economy '' of the 1980s .
5658 5826 The government has been moving ahead with the changes despite concerns they will push some weak firms into collapse , saying that could be the price of future buoyancy .
5827 5912 Already officials have shown they are willing to let the truly sick institutions die .
5913 6089 Yamaichi Securities Co. , once Japan 's largest securities house , officially closed its last offices today , four months after authorities revealed the severity of its losses .
6090 6227 Though officials use the term Big Bang , as if everything happens at once , they have in fact been nibbling away at many rules for years .
6228 6461 According to Clifford J. Shaw , president of Mercury Asset Management Japan Ltd. , Japanese already can buy foreign stocks , foreign mutual funds and hold foreign currency deposits in Japan , in banks such as Citibank and Sanwa Bank .
6462 6637 For individual investors , the major change under the new rules will be freedom to open bank accounts overseas without government approval , eliminating paperwork and hassles .
6638 6899 Analysts here say that some Japanese will shift funds to foreign banks to take advantage of higher interest rates , but that the numbers probably will be limited because of the potential for foreign-currency losses if the value of the yen suddenly were to rise .
6900 6979 `` It 's also possible money will flow overseas to evade taxes , '' Inoue said .
6980 7125 For institutional investors , the major change will be an end to restrictions on how much domestic pension funds must invest in Japanese markets .
7126 7296 For the past two years , the Japanese government has permitted Japanese pension funds to apply for exemptions from those restrictions on a case-by-case basis , Shaw said .
7297 7408 So `` I do n't see this as being a sort of crash , bang , wallop thing , but rather a steady burn , '' he said .
7409 7527 Another reform taking effect on Wednesday will allow any company and individual to make foreign exchange transactions .
7528 7640 News media have predicted that convenience stores and a host of other retailers would plunge into this business .
7641 7695 But so far , no convenience store has stepped forward .
7696 7851 `` I think most places are taking a wait-and-see attitude , '' said Asaka of Bic Camera , one of the few retailers with plans to try the currency business .
7852 7852 .
