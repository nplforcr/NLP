0 447 9806.274 NEWS STORY SOURCE : The Washington Post SECTION : A21 LENGTH : 774 DATE : June 14 , 1998 HEADLINE : Jakarta Allows Protest in E. Timor ; Habibie Rejects Independence Call BODY_LEN : 758 DILI , Indonesia , June 13 - More than 1,000 people , including a few aging resistance fighters , gathered at the University of East Timor today in this Indonesian-occupied territory for a demonstration that was more remarkable for what did not happen .
448 600 Unlike in the past , when Indonesia was ruled by former president Suharto , security forces , for the second time this week , did not harass protesters .
601 733 Soldiers were nowhere to be seen around the campus as the demonstrators spoke over loudspeakers about their desire for independence .
734 745 `` Viva ! ''
746 795 they shouted , punching their fists into the air .
796 1026 They gathered on the back lawn of the campus and some sat on the school 's roof , unfurling banners calling for the release of jailed resistance leader Jose Alexandre ` Xanana ' Gusmao , or proclaiming `` Death or independence ! ''
1027 1237 `` This is a golden chance for us , '' said Jovensio Martinez , 37 , who spent nearly seven years in prison after a 1991 street demonstration during which security forces shot and killed at least 50 protesters .
1238 1369 `` It 's the first chance we get to express our feelings on how to solve our problems and decide our political future , '' he said .
1370 1415 `` We have been crushed down for 23 years . ''
1416 1487 Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975 and annexed it the following year .
1488 1618 The United Nations still recognizes Portugal , East Timor 's former colonial ruler , as the territory 's administrative authority .
1619 1740 In an interview today with the Japanese news service Kyodo , President B.J. Habibie rejected independence for East Timor .
1741 1899 `` The integration of East Timor was accomplished more than 20 years ago with the will of the people themselves , and there is no going back now , '' he said .
1900 2007 He had previously suggested granting the territory `` special status '' but the Timorese rejected the idea .
2008 2108 The students and most of the general population want a referendum to determine the region 's future .
2109 2299 Student protests ushered the fall of Suharto , who stepped down last month after 32 years in power , but that was not until at least four student demonstrators were slain by security forces .
2300 2420 Massive rioting followed , prompting some of Suharto 's key allies , including members of the military , to abandon him .
2421 2540 But it is the military here that wields control , enjoying a certain amount of autonomy from the Indonesian government .
2541 2627 The governor and local military commanders have already warned against demonstrations .
2628 2816 Soldiers have refrained from trying to prevent campus protests here , but they broke up a demonstration Friday by East Timorese at the Foreign Ministry in Jakarta , the Indonesian capital .
2817 3081 It is unclear whether the military is taking a softer line in light of the new political reform era in Indonesia , or is just trying to sort itself out after Suharto 's fall and the deaths of 12 senior regional military commanders in a helicopter crash this month .
3082 3304 The United States suspended most of its military assistance to Indonesia after the 1991 killings in Dili , but nonetheless East Timor hardly registers on the agenda in Jakarta unless foreign governments bring up the issue .
3305 3578 Analysts say the next few weeks should indicate how far the student movement in East Timor will go , but it appears from today 's demonstration that it is unlikely the protesters will try to march in the streets or take over parliament , as students tried to do in Jakarta .
3579 3665 Panic almost erupted during today 's protest when a truck of soldiers merely drove by .
3666 3768 The demonstration was held far out of sight of the main road to lessen the chances of a confrontation .
3769 3838 The climate of fear in East Timor goes much deeper than in Indonesia .
3839 3980 Nearly every other adult in Dili has been detained or tortured , or knows someone who has been , during the past 23 years of Indonesian rule .
3981 4116 Reports from Lisbon said that authorities today detained prominent activist M ' a Huno , who had been a commander of separatist forces .
4117 4295 The military has been trying to root out elements or supporters of the Fretilin independence movement , which has been waging an armed struggle against the Indonesian occupation .
4296 4382 Scattered pockets of resistance remain , but the rebellion has lost much of its steam .
4383 4546 Domingos Maria Alvez , 67 , was one of East Timor 's first resistance fighters and in the 1970s was detained for eight months , tied up in a cave part of the time .
4547 4666 Alvez attended today 's demonstration with his grandson and said he has been waiting years for the chance to speak out .
4667 4729 `` I have hope when I see these young people now , '' he said .
4730 4801 `` When I see them struggling , it gives meaning to my struggle before .
4802 4912 I 'm already old , but my dream would be fulfilled to see the new generation liberated from the oppressors . ''
4913 4913 .
