0 403 9802.283 NEWS STORY SOURCE : The Washington Post SECTION : A01 LENGTH : 730 DATE : February 12 , 1998 HEADLINE : Clinton , Lewinsky Met Alone , Guard Says ; Retired Secret Service Officer Recalls Visit by Intern in Late '95 BODY_LEN : 723 Monica S. Lewinsky spent part of a weekend afternoon in late 1995 alone with President Clinton in the Oval Office , a retired Secret Service officer said yesterday .
404 705 Clinton testified last month that he does not recall ever being alone with Lewinsky , either while she was employed at the White House or later at the Pentagon , except perhaps on very brief occasions when she dropped off papers in his office , according to sources familiar with Clinton 's testimony .
706 929 Former uniformed Secret Service officer Lewis C. Fox said in an interview yesterday that Lewinsky , then a White House intern , spent at least 40 minutes alone with Clinton while Fox was posted outside the Oval Office door .
930 1044 She had arrived with papers for the president , he said , and Clinton instructed Fox to usher her into his office .
1045 1233 Clinton was questioned in a closed-door deposition Jan. 17 in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case about whether he had sexual relationships with Lewinsky and other government employees .
1234 1328 Fox is the first person to publicly say that he saw the president and Lewinsky alone together .
1329 1524 As a result , his statement could be critical to independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr 's attempt to determine whether Clinton did have a relationship with Lewinsky and then attempt to conceal it .
1525 1730 The White House said it could not confirm or deny Fox 's account , but raised questions about it because , an official said , only the president 's assistants allow people in to see him , even on weekends .
1731 1981 `` Without commenting on the specifics , the story is at odds with the common standard procedure , where White House staff make decisions on access to the Oval Office , not security officers , '' said a White House official who asked not to be named .
1982 2042 `` That would be a real deviation from standard practice . ''
2043 2293 Fox , who retired after 27 years with the Secret Service in January 1997 , said he is uncertain of the exact date when Lewinsky visited the Oval Office , but said he believes it was a Saturday afternoon in either September , October or November 1995 .
2294 2555 Lewinsky told onetime friend Linda R. Tripp -- who secretly tape-recorded many of their conversations and gave them to investigators -- that she began a sexual relationship with Clinton on Nov. 15 , 1995 , according to an affidavit Tripp made in the Jones case .
2556 2768 Secret Service spokesman Arnette Heintze said his office would not comment on what Fox or other Secret Service personnel may have seen because the Lewinsky matter is the subject of Starr 's ongoing investigation .
2769 2888 Fox said the day he witnessed Lewinsky visit Clinton , he was posted for a one-hour shift outside the Oval Office door .
2889 3055 It was around midday , he said , and he had been on duty 15 to 20 minutes when Lewinsky arrived saying she had some paperwork she needed to bring in to the president .
3056 3134 Fox said the president 's secretary , Betty Currie , was not on duty that day .
3135 3218 Fox said he opened the Oval Office door and told Clinton there were papers for him .
3219 3330 The president was able to see Lewinsky through the doorway , Fox said , and he told the officer to send her in .
3331 3435 Fox said he remained at his post for another 40 minutes or so before he was relieved by another officer .
3436 3524 During that time , Lewinsky was behind the closed doors of the Oval Office with Clinton .
3525 3597 Fox said he was not aware of what occurred between Clinton and Lewinsky .
3598 3739 Fox , who lives in Waynesburg , Pa. , was interviewed on WPXI television in Pittsburgh last week and said he saw Lewinsky in the White House .
3740 3907 Since that broadcast , he has been contacted by the association that represents Secret Service officers and discouraged from revealing anything more about what he saw .
3908 4059 Officials at the television station said they received a subpoena from Starr for the videotape of the Fox interview and have given it to investigators .
4060 4306 Secret Service director Lewis Merletti has met with lawyers from Starr 's office on the issue of whether agents and officers who guard the president can be compelled to testify about whether they witnessed encounters between Clinton and Lewinsky .
4307 4517 The Secret Service is concerned that allowing agents to testify would set a dangerous precedent , engendering mistrust at the White House and ultimately making it more difficult for them to guard the president .
4518 4629 With that matter unresolved , Starr has refrained from subpoenaing any Secret Service officers , including Fox .
