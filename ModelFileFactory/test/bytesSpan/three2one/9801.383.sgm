0 470 9801.383 NEWS STORY SOURCE : The Washington Post SECTION : A14 LENGTH : 772 DATE : January 10 , 1998 HEADLINE : Belfast Inmates Back Continued Peace Talks ; British Official Wins Promise in Prison Visit BODY_LEN : 750 LONDON , Jan. 9 - Threats to the resumption of the Northern Ireland peace talks receded today after a British cabinet minister entered the huge Maze prison near Belfast and pressed Protestant guerrillas held there to support continuing the discussions .
471 696 Northern Ireland Secretary Marjorie Mowlam sat down with members of two outlawed Protestant paramilitary groups and delivered a 14-point statement on why they should reverse a vote they took last weekend to condemn the talks .
697 751 That vote had thrown the talks ' future into question .
752 802 After she left , the prisoners did what she asked .
803 994 The political party that speaks for them at the negotiating table , the Ulster Democratic Party , announced it was no longer considering boycotting the talks , which are set to resume Monday .
995 1142 Another party affiliated with imprisoned Protestant guerrillas , the Progressive Unionist Party , said it would decide on Sunday whether to attend .
1143 1484 The all-party talks , chaired by former U.S. senator George J. Mitchell -LRB- D-Maine -RRB- , seek a political solution in Northern Ireland between Protestants , most of whom want to remain part of Britain , and Catholics , who want greater political rights , including , for some , political union with the Republic of Ireland to the south .
1485 1618 Throughout the conflict , the British government has held to the line that it talks to people who renounce violence , not to killers .
1619 1751 To many people in Britain , it seemed today that Mowlam was being summoned by men convicted of crimes that include murder and arson .
1752 1912 `` We are very unhappy about it , '' said Glyn Roberts , development officer for a Northern Ireland peace group called Families Against Intimidation and Terror .
1913 2015 Mowlam spoke directly with terrorists , he said , `` which many victims felt was grossly insulting . ''
2016 2100 Addressing reporters after her visit , Mowlam apologized to people who took offense .
2101 2210 But she depicted the trip as part of her commitment to do whatever it takes to keep the peace talks on track .
2211 2335 `` If we manage to get people round the table on Monday , '' she said , `` we have a chance to move this process forward . ''
2336 2414 Mowlam denied being summoned to the prison or submitting to guerrilla threats .
2415 2473 `` There was no metaphorical gun at my head , '' she said .
2474 2529 She also denied offering the prisoners any concessions .
2530 2702 Rather , she said , she delivered a message that their concerns -- particularly that their release be part of any peace accord -- could be addressed only if talks continue .
2703 2833 Currently , 539 people convicted of offenses related to the sectarian conflict live in the huge walled facility known as the Maze .
2834 2910 Their influence in the talks is among the starker paradoxes of the conflict .
2911 3089 Though the British government keeps them locked up , it must also keep in mind their views , because they are viewed as heroes and prisoners of war by many people on the outside .
3090 3141 Their approval is considered key to any settlement .
3142 3290 About half the prisoners are members of the outlawed Irish Republican Army and its spinoffs , which want Northern Ireland to become part of Ireland .
3291 3411 The others are members of various illegal loyalist armed groups that want Northern Ireland to remain a British province .
3412 3547 The prisoners affiliated with the Ulster Defense Association and Ulster Freedom Fighters became the focus of the crisis in recent days .
3548 3715 Angry over the murder of a hard-line loyalist leader in the Maze and the release of IRA prisoners in the Irish republic , they voted to withdraw support for the talks .
3716 3905 A statement issued by the two groups after Mowlam 's visit said they had reversed their previous vote , but added that this `` does not represent a change in our assessment of the talks . ''
3906 4034 Many members of the Protestant community feel frustrated over the talks , saying that Catholics are getting all the concessions .
4035 4209 On Thursday , in an attempt to dispel reports that the prisoners are virtually in charge at the Maze , prison authorities opened the doors to British journalists and cameras .
4210 4354 Inside they filmed barbed wire , tall walls and other security measures -- and prisoner living areas that were done up as paramilitary barracks .
4355 4477 Unit names , coats of arms , militant slogans and pictures of masked men with automatic weapons had been painted on walls .
4478 4558 Prisoners wore no uniforms and relaxed in easy chairs with books and television .
4559 4647 In television interviews , prisoners generally played down their influence on the talks .
4648 4828 `` We are in fact the symptom of the situation which exists in Northern Ireland , '' said Michael Stone , who was convicted of the murder of three people at an IRA funeral in 1988 .
4829 4901 `` At the end of the day we are only a component part of the process . ''
4902 4902 .
