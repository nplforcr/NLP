0 187 ea980127 .1830.1547 NEWS STORY There has been endless speculation here today about how the President , not his speech , but Mr. Clinton himself , will be received on Capitol Hill tonight .
188 208 Here are some clues .
209 258 Mr. Speaker , the President of the United States .
259 378 In the first few minutes after the President arrives in the chamber , you can begin to judge the political temperature .
379 460 Are senators and representatives eager to greet him , shake his hand , touch him ?
461 551 Republicans and Democrats are very aware that the country will be watching them carefully .
552 637 As an occasion , this is meant to be a celebration of the American democratic system .
638 729 This is one of the few ceremonies that , at least in theory , should bring us all together .
730 865 The Republican Speaker of the House , Mr. Gingrich The President of the United States will be an honored guest to the House and Senate .
866 910 So the country will be looking very closely .
911 984 But in all likelihood tonight , the President will be received correctly .
985 1149 So just before we leave to prepare for the State of the Union , a couple of other questions for Sam Donaldson and Cokie Roberts , who 's in the bureau this evening .
1150 1247 Cokie , I talked to a senior Democrat up there today , and I said , Do you believe the President ?
1248 1303 He said , I believe him today , emphatically , he said .
1304 1327 Is that about the mood ?
1328 1363 That 's about the best you 'll get .
1364 1463 uh Even the people speaking on the record and for microphones uh would uh not defend the President .
1464 1540 They said things like , well , you should give him the benefit of the doubt .
1541 1645 uh And of course , off the record and not in the microphones , they 're saying far more damaging things .
1646 1718 But you ca n't count on this scene tonight telling you anything , Peter .
1719 1853 I remember right before Jim Wright had to leave as Speaker of the House , when members were telling us in the press , he 's got to go .
1854 1883 He 's got to get out of here .
1884 1970 He went to a Democratic caucus , and they gave him a big cheer and a standing ovation .
1971 2017 These are not the most straightforward people .
2018 2186 So I think you 're saying that for those people around the country , us included , who are looking for these clues , it 's going to look wired and respectful as always ?
2187 2220 I think that 's absolutely right .
2221 2251 I 'd be amazed if it does n't .
2252 2329 But sometimes something happens that changes that , but it would surprise me .
2330 2383 Okay , let 's go to Sam Donaldson at the White House .
2384 2529 Sam , other than the President 's appearance at church the other day , this is his first big public appearance since he became enveloped in this .
2530 2557 Do you think he 's nervous ?
2558 2589 I think he is probably nervous .
2590 2668 But you can always count on Bill Clinton in a clutch to deliver a speech well .
2669 2698 There 's no doubt about that .
2699 2717 It 's interesting .
2718 2946 Aides have gone over every line of this speech to make certain there 's no double entendre in it , some innocent phrase that in normal times no one would pay attention to , but the country tonight would go hee , hee , hee , hee .
2947 3047 So the speech may be eloquent , but it is not going to be anything that 's other than squeaky clean .
3048 3086 Okay , thanks , both of you very much .
3087 3143 Sam and Cokie , looking forward to talking to you later .
3144 3232 By the way , the Republican response tonight is going to be given by Senator Trent Lott .
3233 3305 He did remove a couple of words that he thought might be misinterpreted .
3306 3441 We hope you 'll join us for our coverage of the Presidents State of the Union address live from Capitol Hill nine o'clock eastern time .
3442 3462 I 'm Peter Jennings .
3463 3502 That 's World News Tonight for tonight .
3503 3556 Have a good evening , and good night from Washington .
3557 3557 .
