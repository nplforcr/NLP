145 432 Workers With Vows to Fight Probe , Win Vindication BODY_LEN : 838 To the cheers of hundreds of employees , Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt vowed yesterday to fight a perjury investigation by an independent counsel and predicted `` absolute vindication '' for himself and his department .
433 596 `` The times are out of sync and so is the system , '' Babbitt told a sympathetic audience that greeted him with a standing ovation in Interior 's main auditorium .
597 677 He said he has been tempted over the past few months `` to say the hell with it .
678 678 .
679 679 .
680 680 .
681 718 I 'm going home , '' but not anymore .
719 732 `` I 'm here .
733 823 I 'm going to fight this out to the bitter end and we will be vindicated , '' he declared .
824 1025 Attorney General Janet Reno asked on Wednesday for appointment of an independent counsel to determine whether Babbitt lied to Congress last fall about his handling of a proposed Indian gambling casino .
1026 1289 Tribes opposed to the Hudson , Wis. , casino project , which was rejected by Interior in July 1995 , contributed more than $ 350,000 to Democrats for the 1996 campaign and launched a full-scale lobbying drive aimed at securing the Interior Department 's decision .
1290 1460 Reno 's petition is awaiting action by a special panel of three federal judges who will name the outside counsel and have the final say on the scope of the investigation .
1461 1563 It will be the first to grow out of alleged fund-raising abuses by the Clinton-Gore reelection effort .
1564 1878 Babbitt 's 15-minute meeting with employees yesterday morning in the 750-seat auditorium was billed as an occasion to `` address concerns '' they might have about the investigation and lay out his plans for the coming year `` to further enhance the administration 's environmental and cultural resources agenda . ''
1879 2036 It had some of the trappings of a campaign rally , with workers handed red-lettered `` FOBB '' -- Friend of Bruce Babbitt -- stickers to put on their lapels .
2037 2294 A former Arizona governor and 1988 Democratic presidential contender , Babbitt seemed buoyed by the full-house reception , shaking hands as he came down the aisle and deftly abandoning a podium with scratchy microphones to begin without one at center stage .
2295 2396 `` Well , the Burton committee is doing its work , '' he quipped when the second mike would n't work .
2397 2493 The House Government Reform and Oversight Committee headed by Rep. Dan Burton -LRB- R-Ind . -RRB-
2494 2648 recently concluded two weeks of hearings on the casino controversy with GOP calls for an independent counsel with a broader mandate than Reno recommended .
2649 2868 Republicans contend the decision to reject the casino was improperly influenced by the prospect of Democratic campaign contributions from opposing tribes and by pressures from White House and Democratic Party officials .
2869 3050 Babbitt has repeatedly denied that allegation , saying the decision was made on recommendations of career Interior officials unaffected by heavy lobbying on both sides of the issue .
3051 3170 `` There is a corrosive , antagonistic , bitter , combative culture which has settled over this town , '' Babbitt said .
3171 3389 He said `` all the facts '' have been made public and all the participants have been `` interviewed , deposed , harassed -LRB- and -RRB- testified '' many times , but his critics refuse to be `` swayed by the facts . ''
3390 3449 And so , Babbitt said , to rousing applause , `` here I am .
3450 3481 And here I 'm going to stay . ''
3482 3680 Babbitt 's predicament stems from a conversation he had with Paul Eckstein , an old friend hired as a lobbyist by pro-casino forces , on July 14 , 1995 , the day the casino application was rejected .
3681 3871 Eckstein has testified that when he asked for a delay , Babbitt told him that Harold Ickes , then White House deputy chief of staff , had called and directed him to make a decision that day .
3872 4049 Babbitt , when testifying before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee last fall , said he did invoke Ickes 's name , but only in an `` awkward '' effort to end the meeting .
4050 4125 He also said that Ickes had not directed him to make the decision that day .
4126 4330 Reno said Wednesday that Babbitt may have perjured himself or violated the false statement statute , but in view of his status as a Cabinet member , only an independent counsel could resolve the question .
4331 4452 Reno also left open the possibility that a wider investigation into allegations of White House influence might be needed .
4453 4659 Encouraged by what he said were constant expressions of support , `` in person , on street corners , in airports , again and again , '' Babbitt was nonetheless frustrated by the prospect of another inquiry .
4660 4888 His lawyer , Lloyd N. Cutler , said in a telephone interview that he anticipates appointment of an independent counsel in a few days , but he noted that it will probably take a month or two before the investigation gets rolling .
4889 5046 `` We are quite confident it will not end up in a proceeding against Bruce , '' said Cutler , who served briefly as President Clinton 's White House counsel .
5047 5176 `` I 'm afraid we 've reached a point where if an independent counsel is even requested , there must be something criminal there .
5177 5204 That 's not true at all . ''
5205 5473 On a stoic note , Babbitt told his employees , `` Life is not always fair ... Sometimes you are in an intersection at the wrong time and the wrong place and you get broadsided through no fault of your own ... The important thing , of course , is not to be deterred . ''
