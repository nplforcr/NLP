Chief 's Visit to Iraq BODY_LEN : 533 AMMAN , Jordan , Feb. 15 - Calls for a diplomatic solution to the Iraq crisis bounded around the Middle East today as leaders anticipated a still unscheduled mission to Baghdad by U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan .
390 592 A visit by the top U.N. diplomat has come to be regarded throughout the region as the world body 's last chance to avert airstrikes on Iraq by U.S. and British bombers massed in the Persian Gulf region .
593 727 No one on any side of the issue seems to oppose the visit , although opinions diverge on just what it would take to defuse the crisis .
728 890 Washington and London are demanding unimpeded access by U.N arms inspectors to suspected storage and production sites for chemical and biological weapons in Iraq .
891 985 The Iraqi leadership wants to alter the makeup of the inspection teams and limit their access .
986 1235 In Baghdad , the government of President Saddam Hussein hosted a three-member U.N. map-making team that arrived to survey eight presidential complexes that arms inspectors think may be storage or production sites for chemical and biological weapons .
1236 1397 The Iraqis seemed eager to display cooperation but also to indicate that the survey was a limited exercise , designed to lay the groundwork for a visit by Annan .
1398 1537 Iraqi helicopters ferried the U.N. team over the sites , and officials permitted ground visits for mapping purposes , Iraqi officials said .
1538 1746 The exercise , said Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed Sahhaf , is meant to `` prepare the information about the presidential sites ... how many acres , are they surrounded by fences , to prepare the maps .

2189 2395 Meanwhile , each passing day brings new evidence that the alliance that staunchly supported the U.S.-led bombing of Iraq in 1991 and the subsequent freeing of Kuwait from Iraqi occupation has disintegrated .
