YAZIGI dLR ; dQC ; dQL ; dUR ; c. 1998 N.Y. Times News Service dLR ; dQC ; dQL ; NEW YORK _ The pink Cristal Champagne was flown in from France , and the rack of lamb was made to order by the chefs at Mortimer 's .
551 669 All so Ilyse Wilpon , whose family is an owner of the Mets , could entertain 113 friends at a private dinner recently .
670 903 Inside the Upper East Side restaurant , which on this evening was closed to the public , men in Turnbull dAMP ; Asser shirts and the latest Hermes ties sat alternately around 12 tables with women with blown-out bobs and Chanel suits .
904 1101 The sexes were evenly balanced _ man , woman , man , woman _ except for a 13th table , at which seven women sat together with a single man -LRB- who seemed to disappear after he ate the lamb -RRB- .
1102 1248 Ms. Wilpon , 35 , who co-owns and manages Tati North America , a French bridal store on Fifth Avenue , was concerned about the table 's imbalance .
1249 1385 `` Seating can get so complicated , '' she sighed , standing by the bar , wearing black and white pearls and a strapless Givenchy dress .
1386 1458 At the last minute , seven of her guests had canceled , all of them men .
1459 1536 They blamed late planes and sudden business meetings -LRB- sure , sure -RRB- .
1537 1604 Ms. Wilpon seated the extra women with her 92-year-old grandmother .
1605 1655 But no one seemed overjoyed about the arrangement .
1656 1847 From Park Avenue to Park Slope , an age-old imbalance confronts the givers of dinner parties : men seem so much more reluctant than women to dress nicely and converse politely around a table .
1848 2132 All over town , men and women who attend dinner parties _ whether intimate ones in private homes , black-tie charity affairs in hotel ballrooms or , the latest trend , parties in hot restaurants _ agree that the male of the species is difficult to lure out of his lair for an evening .
2133 2348 Lauran Walk , 27 , a production coordinator for Sony studios , said it was nearly impossible to get her husband , Charlie Walk , a music promotion executive , to accompany her to dinner parties given by her friends .
2349 2402 `` He always gives me a hard time , '' Ms. Walk said .
2403 2462 `` He says he 's really tired or he wants a quiet night . ''
2463 2560 Scott Jones , 30 , a tax manager who lives in the East 20s , says he zones out at dinner parties .
2561 2708 When his girlfriend , Sherri Weiss , asks him to go with her , he says , `` I suddenly remember a buddy who is in some serious need of guidance . ''
2709 2913 The reluctance challenges dinner-party hosts , who almost invariably say that whether their guests are married or single , gay or straight , dinner parties ought to have equal representation by the sexes .
2914 3147 `` My friends and I say you should go downstairs , dress up the doorman and bring him up to the table rather than be short a man , '' said Jackie Weld , a writer living on the Upper East Side , who gives dinner parties twice a month .
3148 3370 Polly Onet , a professional party planner who has organized events from small birthday parties to the society wedding of David and Julia Koch , said : `` Women do n't want to get all dressed up and sit next to other women .
3371 3413 And women love to go out more than men . ''
3414 3606 Why , oh why is this the case in the capital of the universe in 1998 , when such differences between the sexes might seem to have gone the way of formal dance cards and white tie and cutaways ?
3607 3713 Men and women who are experienced both as reluctant guests and imploring hosts offer a variety of reasons .
3714 3951 `` Women are more adventurous than men , '' admitted Soli Mehta , 36 , an investment banker , adding that he 'd rather go to the same familiar restaurants in jeans than dress up and sit next to someone he does n't know at a dinner party .
3952 4009 `` It 's about being comfortable after work , '' he said .
4010 4097 Women , in his experience , `` like to try new things , dress up , go to new places . ''
4098 4292 Letitia Baldrige , the etiquette maven , said the difference traces to the time when women were denied access to the working world , with its opportunity for social and intellectual stimulation .
4293 4382 `` Women have fought for years to be part of important dinner conversation , '' she said .
4383 4453 `` It 's their only time for social intercourse with the opposite sex .
4454 4474 Lunch is for ladies .
4475 4494 Dinner is for both .
4495 4659 Women , many times , have been with the children all day , or even if they have n't , they may be bored with their own husbands and want another husband to talk to .
4660 4719 Who knows , they may even end up marrying the other one . ''
4720 4824 Today , of course , most women work , and many have opportunities for social interaction during the day .
4825 4925 But even professional women seem to enjoy the dinner-party ritual more than their male counterparts .
4926 5130 `` I like getting dressed up , '' said Ellen V. Futter , the president of the American Museum of Natural History , who said it does n't matter whether the event is an extension of work or her social life .
5131 5196 Her husband , she said , is much harder to coax out of the house .
5197 5222 -LRB- STORY CAN END HERE .
5223 5464 OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS -RRB- Ann Stock , the vice president of institutional affairs at the Kennedy Center in Washington and a former White House social secretary , said , `` I would go to anything that seems even remotely interesting . ''
5465 5539 But her husband , Stuart Stock , a lawyer , barely wants to go out at all .
5540 5613 `` We have so much discussion before he ever gets anywhere , '' she said .
5614 5627 `` He whines .
5628 5657 He says it 's a school night .
5658 5759 And if it 's a seated dinner , he 's dead , because he ca n't control the time at which you leave . ''
5760 5875 She sometimes resorts to calling her husband 's secretary and having her secretly pencil in a date on his calendar .
5876 5959 `` He says , ` How did that get there ; I do n't remember this one , ' '' she said .
5960 6204 Many men speak of the dread of being `` stuck '' at a dinner party , seated between guests they do not know and may never see again , and if it 's a weekday , they are anxious about getting to bed early enough to face another day at the office .
6205 6563 `` There 's a sort of gloom that settles over the room when it 's 9:30 p.m. and the food has n't been served and the speeches have n't started and you know you wo n't be home before midnight , '' said James B. Meigs , the editor in chief of Premiere magazine , a family man who reluctantly attends charity benefits and work-related dinner parties in midweek .
6564 6623 To be sure , there are working women who feel the same way .
6624 6807 Debra Cohen , a 35-year-old criminal defense lawyer in Manhattan who was attending Ms. Wilpon 's dinner , said , `` My time is limited , so I pick carefully which parties to go to . ''
6808 7047 But on the whole , the testimony of dinner-party hosts clearly points to an inequity between the sexes on this issue _ one that seems to have heretofore escaped the scrutiny of sociologists , psychologists and women 's studies departments .
7048 7224 Inveterate partygivers , including the professionals who plan the charity galas that are a mainstay of Manhattan social life , have an arsenal of tricks for luring male guests .
7225 7458 They conspire with caterers to plan menus suited to men 's tastes _ entrees like leg of lamb and chocolate desserts _ and then list the courses on menu cards in the hope of enticing men to sit through the meal rather than bolt early .
7459 7583 If men see fish or lemon chiffon on the menu , `` they might escape at any time , '' Christopher Robbins , a caterer , said .
7584 7681 `` Instead we have something like a dense chocolate truffle cake , ending with a great rare port .
7682 7725 They will know it 's something to hang for .
7726 7775 It 's all about keeping them in the apartment . ''
7776 7837 Another potent lure is the promise of a new business contact .
7838 8018 Even Walk , reluctant to attend parties given by his wife 's friends , says he is happy to make exceptions for dinners involving contacts in his industry , music and entertainment .
8019 8122 `` When you allocate your precious time you want to take something away with you , '' Walk , 30 , said .
8123 8399 George Trescher , an organizer of many high-profile public parties , said that a magazine celebrating a big anniversary recently wanted to carry this principle to an extreme : it proposed seating all the powerful men together and `` letting the ladies fall where they will . ''
8400 8452 Trescher refused , and the seating was conventional .
8453 8563 `` It 's only the lower class in other countries where the men and the women do not sit together , '' he said .
8564 8721 What is wrong , one might ask , with unbalanced tables at this late date in the 20th century , when almost every other social convention has been undermined ?
8722 8920 Yet , even as modern a man as Michael Caruso , the editor in chief of Details magazine , who gives dinner parties once every two or three weeks for 10 to 16 guests , insists on balancing the tables .
8921 9035 He cites the same reason as many hosts : the mild sexual tension that ensues , even among happily married couples .
9036 9115 `` When there 's a sexual element , that 's always fun , '' Caruso , 36 , said .
9116 9190 `` Anytime there 's good food , alcohol and sex , it makes a good time . ''
9191 9348 He invariably holds his soirees in hip restaurants like Lot 61 , Indochine and Casa La Femme ; the dinner-party-in-a-restaurant seems to be the latest trend .
9349 9415 `` Dinner parties are definitely the thing right now , '' he said .
9416 9466 `` It goes along with this nouveau sophistication .
9467 9505 It 's what your parents used to do . ''
9506 9796 Sydney Biddle Barrows , the famed Mayflower Madam who has written a book , `` Just Between Us Girls : Secrets About Men From the Madam Who Knows '' -LRB- St. Martin 's Press , 1996 -RRB- , said that her husband , Darnay Hoffman , a lawyer , hates to go out and so she frequently goes alone .
9797 9840 `` I was single for 42 years , '' she said .
9841 9880 `` I never needed a man to go anywhere .
9881 9959 I think the women who are not going out by themselves are cheating themselves .
9960 9986 I do n't understand it . ''
9987 10154 Mindful , however , that some party hosts look askance at women who arrive dateless and further imbalance the tables , Ms. Barrows sometimes invites a gay male friend .
10155 10172 So does Ms. Onet .
10173 10299 So do so many women on the Upper East Side that the institution of the habitually available extra man has a name : the walker .
10300 10521 Walkers _ the term is considered derogatory by many , though it is widely used _ are single men , often but not exclusively gay , who enjoy going out night after night and who have the wardrobe and social graces to match .
10522 10770 A walker is not expected to pay for transportation , drinks or gala tickets -LRB- that is the function of the woman who invited him -RRB- , but he must make witty conversation , look swell and escort his date to her door -LRB- and no farther -RRB- .
10771 10942 The socialite Nan Kempner is well known for bringing escorts other than her husband , the Wall Street investor Thomas Kempner , who prefers to be in bed most nights by 11 .
10943 11006 `` My Tommy does n't particularly like going out , '' she said .
11007 11128 So Ms. Kempner , who does _ often five nights a week _ arranges for escorts like Kenneth Jay Lane , the jewelry designer .
11129 11287 Lane , who said he goes to dinner parties `` 370 days out of 365 days in the year , '' said that sometimes the invitations arrive just hours before the event .
11288 11395 `` You know , when husbands get sick and the hostess says , ` I 'm desperate , I need a man , ' '' he said .
11396 11468 Lane said his cachet lies in the fact that he can `` talk to a stone . ''
11469 11556 When he asks hostesses if he can bring a guest of his own , `` they groan , '' he said .
11557 11714 `` We 're necessary , '' Lane said of the institution of the walker , a term first applied in the 1970s to Jerome Zipkin , a frequent escort of Nancy Reagan .
11715 11777 `` I do n't think ladies want to dress up and only see ladies .
11778 11830 And husbands , they do n't always like to go out . ''
11831 12072 At Ms. Wilpon 's party at Mortimer 's , Joel Leff , the chairman of Forstmann-Leff Associates , an investment management firm , said he gets 15 dinner-party invitations a week _ in large part , he admitted , because he is single and wealthy .
12073 12137 He accepts many of them , but there are limits to his fortitude .
12138 12357 `` Let me tell you about the usefulness of my dogs at a dinner party , '' he said , explaining how he extricates himself from parties with the excuse that he must walk his two King Charles spaniels , Edison and Smudgin .
12358 12424 Just as the chocolate mousse was served , Leff jumped to his feet .
12425 12459 `` My dogs , my dogs , '' he said .
12460 12561 He walked toward the door , leaving behind five impeccably dressed women , and no men , at his table .
