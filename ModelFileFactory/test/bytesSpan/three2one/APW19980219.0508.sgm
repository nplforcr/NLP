276 492 dQL ; dUR ; By GREG MYRE dQC ; dUR ; Associated Press Writer dQC ; MOSCOW -LRB- AP -RRB- _ Two Russians and a Frenchman left the Mir and endured a rough landing on the snow-covered plains of Central Asia on Thursday .
493 611 But no one was hurt as the crew completed a successful mission on the 12th anniversary of the space station 's launch .
612 891 Cosmonauts Anatoly Solovyov and Pavel Vinogradov and French astronaut Leopold Eyharts were briefly buffeted about in their Soyuz space capsule when they touched down in the empty steppe of central Kazakstan , the ITAR-Tass news agency reported , citing Mission Control officials .
892 996 It took the crew three hours to descend from the Mir , 400 kilometers -LRB- 250 miles -RRB- above Earth .
997 1136 Space officials were worried beforehand about a blizzard that raged through former Soviet republic on Wednesday evening and early Thursday .
1137 1231 They considered delaying the crew 's return , but gave the go-ahead when the weather improved .
1232 1350 `` Guys , do n't you worry , the weather is getting better , '' Mission Control Chief Vladimir Solovyov told the crew .
1351 1462 Still , strong winds at the landing site dragged the tiny landing capsule across the steppe as it touched down .
1463 1520 Deep snow helped cushion the impact , ITAR-Tass reported .
1521 1621 Immediately after the landing , the trio was put on a flight to Moscow for routine medical checkups .
1622 1775 The two Russians arrived on the Mir last August when the troubled space station was hobbled by a number of breakdowns , including a reduced power supply .
1776 1849 But Solovyov and Vinogradov performed several successful repair missions .
1850 1949 The station is now back at close to full power and has not had any major problems in recent months .
1950 2072 Solovyov , one of the most experienced space flyers ever , celebrated his 50th birthday during his six-month space voyage .
2073 2162 He completed his fifth mission on the Mir and has now spent more than 20 months in space .
2163 2295 This was Vinogradov 's first stint on the Mir , while Eyharts was aboard for the past three weeks conducting scientific experiments .
2296 2397 The Mir was launched on Feb. 19 , 1986 , and was expected to remain in operation for only five years .
2398 2552 A series of near disasters last year , including a fire , computer breakdowns , and a collision with a cargo ship , raised doubts about the Mir 's safety .
2553 2696 But Russian space officials want to keep the spacecraft manned at least until next year , when an new international space station is put aloft .
2697 2792 Russians Talgat Musabayev and Nikolai Budarin and American Andrew Thomas remain aboard the Mir .
