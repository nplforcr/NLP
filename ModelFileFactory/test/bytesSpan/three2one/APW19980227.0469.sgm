461 579 Sports Minister Tony Banks termed `` miserly '' the allocation of only 9,128 tickets for England 's first three games .
580 692 Home Secretary Jack Straw warned that demand would exceed supply even if the allocation were doubled or tripled .
693 838 `` The demand would still outstrip supply by a factor 100 or 1,000 , '' Straw said , warning of danger if fans without tickets swarm into France .
839 1106 `` What is absolutely critical is that we must not let this controversy about the relatively low level of ticket allocation be used as an excuse to justify ... criminals and hooligans causing trouble at the games , '' added Straw , the minister in charge of policing .
1107 1362 Several other European countries _ Germany , Belgium , the Netherlands and Denmark among them _ have had similar complaints about France 's ticketing policy , brought about by relatively small stadiums and an increase of World Cup finalists from 24 to 32 .
1363 1452 `` This is making something of a mockery of a great footballing festival , '' Banks said .
1453 1644 Twenty-two members of parliament also weighed in Friday with a motion condemning `` the action of the French ticketing authorities , '' terming it a breach of European Commission regulations .
1645 1898 The motion calls on Prime Minister Tony Blair , serving in the six-month rotating presidency of the European Union , `` to press for swift punitive action and a proper allocation of tickets for British fans hoping to attend this festival of football . ''
1899 2020 The English Football Association has also asked soccer 's world governing body FIFA to press the French for more tickets .
2021 2104 `` We will take this as far as we possible can , '' said FA spokesman David Davies .
2105 2182 `` At the moment our concern has gone to FIFA General Secretary Sepp Blatter .
2183 2305 We know there is deep concern and that has been reflected in the telephone conversation we 've had right across Europe . ''
2306 2462 Straw , speaking Friday at a roundtable on hooliganism and security in the northern city of Blackburn , warned fans not to travel to France without tickets .
2463 2563 `` Despite what anyone claims _ no one has tickets , as they have yet to be printed , '' Straw said .
2564 2685 Straw also pointed out that under French law , tickets are invalid `` unless they are bought from an authorized agent . ''
2686 2936 Under the current allocation , England will receive 3,790 tickets for its opening match against Tunisia in Marseille on June 15 ; 2,749 for the game against Romania in Toulouse on June 22 ; and 2,589 for the match against Colombia in Lens on June 26 .
2937 3021 The stadium capacity is 60,000 in Marseille , 37,000 in Toulouse and 41,000 in Lens .
