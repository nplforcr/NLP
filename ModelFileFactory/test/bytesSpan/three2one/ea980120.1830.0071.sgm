86 189 We are here this week to witness the rendezvous that Fidel Castro and the Pope are having with history .
190 284 We are here because what happens on this island will also have an impact on the United States .
285 343 Everything that happens in Cuba gets America 's attention .
344 535 Incidentally , we just show up to do the broadcast , and Cubans want to know what we 're going to tell Americans , in many cases , what their relatives in the United States are going to hear .
536 693 Well , this is the eve of the Pope 's visit to one of the last bastions of Communism anywhere in the world , and it is already causing enormous expectations .
694 749 In Revolution Square , they put up a giant cross today .
750 855 And right across from the Cuban revolutionary icon Che Guevara , they now have a giant portrait of Jesus .
856 904 Above it in Spanish , Jesus , in you we believe .
905 1077 Not all Cubans believe , but Castro has invited everyone to welcome the man who has been one of Communism 's most effective adversaries , and that 's why there is suspense .
1078 1143 Everyone appears to believe that somehow Cuba is going to change .
1144 1206 Castro has said officially that it 's okay to be enthusiastic .
1207 1408 And so , people are increasingly enthusiastic by the day - -LRB- -LRB- NS -RRB- -RRB- Today , Cuban television , which clings to the Communist Party line , actually began to promote its papal coverage .
1409 1584 Today , hundreds of people from the US began to arrive , including some Cuban Americans who left here when Castro came to power and are returning to Havana for the first time .
1585 1648 The Pope 's visit is important , but they are also coming home .
1649 1701 This is quite an extraordinary story unfolding here .
1702 1752 We 'll come back to Havana later in the broadcast .
