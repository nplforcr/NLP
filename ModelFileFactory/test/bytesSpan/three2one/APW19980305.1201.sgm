406 664 dQL ; dUR ; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD dQC ; dUR ; Associated Press Writer dQC ; TEHRAN , Iran -LRB- AP -RRB- _ Iran has declined an invitation from the U.S. Soccer Federation to play a friendly match in the United States , an Iranian soccer official said Thursday .
665 903 Mohsen Safai Farahani , the president of Iran 's football federation , said the USSF sent a fax about two weeks ago , inviting Iran to come to the United States `` in an all-expenses paid trip to meet the U.S. team in a friendly match . ''
904 1074 `` Unfortunately , and because our program is fully booked and because of the long distance , we thanked them and turned the invitation down , '' Farahani told reporters .
1075 1256 However , USSF vice president and deputy commissioner of U.S. Major League Soccer Sunil Gulati said Thursday that the invitation was for Iran to play Mexico , not the United States .
1257 1360 `` Mexico wants to play some Asian teams because they have South Korea in their group , '' Gulati said .
1361 1592 Since Mexico on occasion plays in the United States , often to reach their heavy support in Southern California , the USSF acted on behalf of the Mexican federation in sending out invitation letters to South Korea , Iran and China .
1593 1641 Gulati also approached Japan verbally , he said .
1642 1855 Also attending the press conference was Croatian coach Tomislav Ivic , who took over the Iranian team from Brazilian Valdir Vierra after Iran claimed the last spot in the 32-team World Cup field in France in June .
1856 2009 `` It would have been a fantastic opportunity and we would 've liked to go there but our schedule was complete and we could n't change it , '' Ivic said .
2010 2129 The United States and Iran are grouped together along with Germany and Yugoslavia for the first round of the World Cup .
2130 2333 Ivic said the Iranian team will travel to France next week to play against first division teams Montpellier and Nantes before returning to Tehran for friendly matches against Hungary , Ghana and Jamaica .
2334 2415 Ivic downplayed the importance of Iran 's World Cup match with the United States .
2416 2458 `` We want to qualify to the second round .
2459 2482 This is our first wish .
2483 2565 All three games are different and we need to prepare special tactics for each one .
2566 2604 Each game is important , '' Ivic said .
2605 2745 He said the roster for the finals was not complete and he was awaiting a number of players to join the camp after finishing their club duty .
2746 2865 Some 15 players , who form the backbone of the national team , are from Iran 's two major clubs , Esteqlal and Piroozi .
2866 2922 Both teams are currently engaged in Asian championships .
2923 3094 Despite the risk of losing one or more of the players to injury , Farahani said he was happy that the Esteqlal and Piroozi players were competing in regional competitions .
3095 3224 `` We believe that playing in the league and Asian tournaments will create the best situation for the national team , '' he said .
