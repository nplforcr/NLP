0 383 9802.305 NEWS STORY SOURCE : The Washington Post SECTION : A14 LENGTH : 872 DATE : February 10 , 1998 HEADLINE : PLO Leaders Mute Support for Saddam This Time BODY_LEN : 835 In a driving hail storm , a small knot of rowdy Palestinian teenagers demonstrated their support for Iraq and President Saddam Hussein today in the time-honored way -- by holding a lighter to an American flag .
384 412 No go ; the flag was soaked .
413 522 So , with television cameras rolling and everyone dripping wet , they resorted to tearing the flag to pieces .
523 780 It was a soggy reenactment of the larger and more passionate pro-Iraqi demonstrations of 1991 , when Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat openly sided with Saddam Hussein during the Persian Gulf War and thousands of Palestinians cheered .
781 884 The fallout from Iraq 's defeat in that war took its toll on Palestinians economically and politically .
885 988 Today , as another showdown in the Persian Gulf looms , many Palestinians still support Saddam Hussein .
989 1055 But this time , their leaders mostly are keeping their heads down .
1056 1160 The Palestinian leadership 's muted response to the latest gulf crisis reflects a new political reality .
1161 1303 The 1991 war came in the midst of the intifada , the six-year Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip .
1304 1452 Most Palestinians perceived the United States as their enemy , and Saddam Hussein was revered as an Arab leader with the guts to take on Washington .
1453 1658 Today , four years after Arafat and the late Israeli leader , Yitzhak Rabin , launched a peace process under U.S. auspices , Palestinians have too much to lose by being seen to embrace the Iraqi president .
1659 1819 Although negotiations have been stalled for nearly a year , the Palestinians are aware that only Washington has the clout to get the peace process moving again .
1820 1987 In recent days , as small street rallies in Gaza and the West Bank have captured air time on the evening news , Arafat and his lieutenants have been all but invisible .
1988 2195 When they do make an appearance , it is generally to express blandly their support for the Iraqi people and their hopes for a diplomatic solution and to complain that Washington is treating Baghdad unfairly .
2196 2256 Generally , Saddam Hussein 's name does not pass their lips .
2257 2459 Although Arafat 's Fatah faction of the PLO is organizing some of the street protests , Fatah officials have explained almost apologetically that they are merely a way for Palestinians to let off steam .
2460 2732 The rallies are a way for Palestinians `` to let out their frustrations '' over the deadlock in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process and a perceived U.S. double standard in dealing with Israel and the Arabs , Marwan Barghouti , a Fatah leader , told the Associated Press .
2733 2944 In the West Bank town of Bethlehem , south of Jerusalem , 14 Palestinians were injured Saturday when Israeli troops fired rubber-coated metal bullets at a few hundred demonstrators who attacked them with stones .
2945 3078 Today , in the northern West Bank town of Jenin , between 1,000 and 2,000 demonstrators carried posters of Saddam Hussein and Arafat .
3079 3233 `` Death to Clinton and Blair , '' read one banner , referring to British Prime Minister Tony Blair , who has supported President Clinton 's Iraqi policy .
3234 3411 And here in Ramallah , north of Jerusalem , about 150 marchers burned U.S. , Israeli and British flags and chanted , `` With our blood and soul , we will redeem you , Saddam . ''
3412 3537 Demonstrators eluded Palestinian police to throw stones at Israeli troops , who fired rubber-coated bullets to disperse them .
3538 3661 Although small , the rallies show that Saddam Hussein continues to exercise a hold on the imagination of many Palestinians .
3662 3816 In a culture defined by the conviction that it has been victimized by Israel , many people identify with the Iraqi leader as another Arab unjustly abused .
3817 3915 If Saddam Hussein has weapons of mass destruction , say many Palestinians , well , so does Israel .
3916 4132 `` He 's defending himself just as we are ; he 's not doing anything wrong , '' said Ramzi Hussein of Ramallah , an aspiring violist in his late teens who wears his hair high and tight and his politics on his sleeve .
4133 4154 `` It 's his country .
4155 4186 He can do whatever he wants . ''
4187 4332 Other Palestinians said they had no special regard for Saddam Hussein , but nonetheless resented what they regard as Washington 's war-mongering .
4333 4620 `` I do n't care if they want to take Saddam out of power , but if you look at it from a humanitarian point of view , people are starving '' in Iraq , said a Palestinian who gave his name only as Rob , a thirtyish computer engineer who lives in Arizona and returned to Ramallah to visit .
4621 4760 Many Palestinians are aware that the current crisis will do nothing to advance the peace process or their aspirations for greater autonomy .
4761 5002 First , Clinton 's political crisis in Washington seemed to neutralize his attempts to unblock the stalemated negotiations ; now , with the administration 's gaze focused on Iraq , the problems of the West Bank will have to wait even longer .
5003 5189 Today , Palestinian and Israeli negotiators headed to Washington for the latest round of peace talks , but given events in the Persian Gulf , little progress was expected by either side .
5190 5329 Meanwhile , Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu has used the Palestinians ' lingering pro-Iraq sentiment to attack them in the media .
5330 5464 `` It brings back unpleasant memories , and it shows the need for real acceptance of Israel ; that has not sunk in , '' he said today .
5465 5465 .
