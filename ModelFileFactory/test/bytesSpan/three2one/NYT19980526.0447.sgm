Times News Service dLR ; dQC ; dQL ; WASHINGTON _ If only Leonard Bernstein could see it : Gerry Adams in Armani from Macy 's , with all the New York society babes chasing after him .
450 591 The late conductor would truly appreciate the Radical Chic transformation of the Sinn Fein leader as he makes his U.S. victory lap this week .
592 732 Adams , considered a miraculous hero by some and a cold stone murderer by others , was dubbed `` Ireland 's Black Panther '' by Vanity Fair .
733 936 In his essay `` Radical Chic , '' Tom Wolfe skewered the New York elite in the '60s who were feting Black Panthers , feeding them little Roquefort cheese morsels off silver trays held by uniformed maids .
937 1015 Now Washington , New York and Hollywood are caught up in Irish terrorist chic .
1016 1102 `` Gerry has got that revolutionary aura , that whiff of cordite , '' says one friend .
1103 1130 `` Bianca Jagger calls him .
1131 1195 All the rich American society hostesses throw themselves at him .
1196 1218 He 's amused by it . ''
1219 1339 Thursday the revolutionary Socialist will stroll through the New York Stock Exchange with its chairman , Richard Grasso .
1340 1657 The 49-year-old , who is likely to be elected next month to help run the new Northern Ireland government , has meetings with top financiers and fund-raisers with celebrities in New York , before coming to the White House on Friday to see the national security adviser , Sandy Berger _ with a probable Clinton drop-by .
1658 1736 Anjelica Huston , Donald Trump , and Martin Sheen have all partied with Gerry .
1737 1808 Adams groupies include young Clintonites who worked on the Irish issue .
1809 1896 `` He 's their Ho Chi Minh , '' dryly notes Mike Barnacle , the Boston Globe columnist .
1897 2023 It was not long ago that Adams was so isolated that his voice was not allowed to be broadcast on British or Irish TV or radio .
2024 2059 -LRB- Actors spoke his words . -RRB-
2060 2260 The Unionist leader David Trimble did not speak to , or shake hands with , Adams during the Stormont talks or during their `` Yes '' campaign , though the two ended up side by side in the men 's room .
2261 2352 One top Irish official praised Adams , saying `` He took his horse to the highest fence . ''
2353 2659 Because the Sinn Fein leader is so smooth and carefully calculating , the official said , it is easy to underestimate the difficulty _ and danger , in an organization known to kill its own _ of keeping the cease-fire largely intact while renegotiating Sinn Fein 's traditional position of unity or nothing .
2660 2894 The man who bears the scars of bullet wounds from one assassination attempt and the memories of more recent ones , the man who can never sleep two nights in the same place faces more high fences on the sticky issue of decommissioning .
2895 3097 `` What this man is trying to do is unparalleled in Irish history , trying to take an armed revolutionary movement and put it on the political path , '' said Niall O'Dowd , publisher of The Irish Voice .
3098 3137 `` It did n't work for Michael Collins .
3138 3166 There are enormous risks . ''
3167 3248 O'Dowd spurred peace by playing matchmaker between Sinn Fein and the White House .
3249 3314 I talked to Adams at Sinn Fein headquarters in Belfast last week .
3315 3464 Sitting outside the heavily fortified stucco building , he took off his sandals and green socks to put balm on a wasp bite he got while hill walking .
3465 3515 Besides hiking , he relaxes by listening to music .
3516 3569 `` I 'm increasingly taken by Ry Cooder , '' he said .
3570 3664 `` That 's a chopper you hear , '' he said , about a hovering British surveillance helicopter .
3665 3751 Pointing to the window grates , he adds : `` There were bomb attacks , rocket attacks .
3752 3783 See those marks in the wall ? ''
3784 3873 He knows Ian Paisley wants to sabotage the new government ; he knows prejudice dies hard .
3874 3986 `` My home was bombed , my wife and son were at home when a hand grenade was exploded at the house , '' he said .
3987 4174 `` So if I 'm prepared to reach out the hand of friendship to the people who did that , and shot me , I think that gives me some moral right to say to others , hey , let 's get real here .
4175 4198 OK , people got killed .
4199 4222 We all lost friends . ''
4223 4254 Will there ever be Irish unity ?
4255 4335 `` I certainly think , if God spares me , it will be reunited in my lifetime . ''
4336 4393 Does he dream of being the Taoiseach of a united Ireland ?
4394 4444 `` No , I will have retired gracefully by then . ''
4445 4499 And which ministry does he want in the new government ?
4500 4577 `` Minister of Funny Walks , '' he replied , as the helicopter whirred above .
