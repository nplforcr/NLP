0 466 9806.455 NEWS STORY SOURCE : The Washington Post SECTION : C01 LENGTH : 1138 DATE : June 02 , 1998 HEADLINE : American Home To Buy Monsanto ; $ 33 Billion Deal to Form Life-Sciences Giant BODY_LEN : 937 American Home Products Corp. said yesterday that it will acquire biotechnology leader Monsanto Co. in a $ 33 billion deal designed to create a powerhouse in the market for genetically engineered breakthroughs in agriculture , food , pharmaceuticals and nutrition .
467 571 The new company , as yet unnamed , would seek to capitalize on a revolution sweeping biological science .
572 776 It would have approximately $ 23 billion in sales in 1998 and would combine American Home 's strength in health products with Monsanto 's enormous capabilities in agricultural and pharmaceutical research .
777 957 Various divisions of American Home sell Advil , ChapStick , Robitussin cough products , Centrum vitamins , Premarin hormone supplements and other products that are household names .
958 1181 The deal , if approved by regulators and stockholders , would provide Monsanto with the money and marketing clout to move a fat portfolio of new drugs and agricultural products from the development pipeline into production .
1182 1274 And it would give American Home a far bigger stake in biotechnology , a hot growth industry .
1275 1522 The proposed merger comes at a time when Monsanto and other biotechnology companies have formed alliances to help them survive intensifying competition and capitalize on new opportunities in the field known broadly as `` life sciences '' research .
1523 1829 Deepening scientific knowledge about the way genes work in plants , animals and people is allowing companies to develop new treatments for diseases , new methods to raise crop yields and improve the flavor of fruits and vegetables , and new ways to lessen the environmental damage from farms and factories .
1830 2021 These various endeavors , once seen as distinct businesses , are coming to look more alike because progress in all of them is increasingly based on manipulating tiny bits of genetic material .
2022 2272 `` We will have the scientific depth , global marketing capabilities and financial resources to take greater advantage of the opportunities before us and to bring innovative new products to market faster , '' said Monsanto Chairman Robert B. Shapiro .
2273 2378 Shapiro , 59 , and American Home Chairman John R. Stafford , 60 , will be co-chairmen of the new company .
2379 2602 Executives of Monsanto and American Home said they hope to create a prototype of the life-sciences company of the future , equally adept at putting new knowledge to work to build a better tomato or to treat a human disease .
2603 2840 `` There is an enormous market for products that will help us live longer , overcome disease and have a higher quality of life , '' said Carl Feldbaum , head of the Biotechnology Industry Organization , a trade group based in Washington .
2841 2966 `` We 're talking about a wide variety of new products that will lead to cures , better nutrition , a cleaner environment . ''
2967 3178 Indeed , the opportunities are now so numerous that many of the world 's biotechnology companies are choking on information , unable to deploy enough capital to move all their good ideas onto the market at once .
3179 3280 `` We are one of the prime examples of that , '' said Nicholas L. Reding , vice chairman of Monsanto .
3281 3475 When Shapiro took over Monsanto in 1995 , he began pushing the company hard toward life-sciences research , ultimately spinning off the chemicals business on which Monsanto was originally built .
3476 3630 The result was an embarrassment of riches , a product pipeline so fat that Monsanto cut shareholder dividends to try to develop many new products at once .
3631 3725 `` We are rolling out products in agricultural biotech at an incredible rate , '' Reding said .
3726 3806 `` And we have four or five major , major drugs coming in the next few years . ''
3807 3978 Monsanto last month acquired the nation 's second-largest seed company , DeKalb Genetics Corp. , and Delta d Pine Land Co. , which breeds and produces cotton and soybeans .
3979 4130 But even as it was announcing those deals , Monsanto was viewed as a likely target of a takeover , possibly by DuPont Co. , Pfizer Inc. or Zeneca PLC. .
4131 4335 Indeed , though the agreement between the two companies requires a payment of $ 700 million if either subsequently walks away from the deal , other bidders for Monsanto might still emerge , analysts said .
4336 4525 Under the terms of the deal , Mosanto shareholders will receive 1.15 shares in the new company for each share of Monsanto they own , and American Home share owners will retain their shares .
4526 4610 Monsanto 's shareholders will hold about 35 percent of the stock of the new company .
4611 4653 The news got mixed reviews from investors .
4654 4769 American Home shares rose 93Ê3\/4 cents to close at $ 49.25 in consolidated trading on the New York Stock Exchange .
4770 4837 Monsanto shares fell 87Ê1\/2 cents , to $ 54.50 , also on the NYSE .
4838 5038 Historically , Monsanto 's greatest strength has been in its agricultural products , including its herbicide Roundup , a worldwide success that has grown at a rate of about 20 percent year after year .
5039 5205 Monsanto has built on that success by genetically engineering crops that will resist Roundup -- which kills anything green -- while it wipes out the weeds among them .
5206 5535 In 1985 , the company acquired G.D. Searle d Co. to move into the pharmaceutical industry , where it has a number of potentially promising products under development and nearing approval by the Food and Drug Administration , including an anti-arthritis drug that does n't cause the stomach and intestinal damage of similar drugs .
5536 5649 American Home Products is based in Madison , N.J. , which is to be the corporate headquarters of the new company .
5650 5947 Earlier this year the company , which had been under pressure since last fall when it was forced to withdraw two obesity drugs from the market amid safety concerns , had talked about a possible merger with SmithKline Beecham PLC , the manufacturer of the cold medicine Contac and the antacid Tums .
5948 5990 But the talks collapsed short of a merger .
5991 6197 Although the company is best known for pharmaceuticals and over-the-counter remedies , American Home also has an agricultural chemicals business that it acquired when it took over American Cyanamid in 1994 .
