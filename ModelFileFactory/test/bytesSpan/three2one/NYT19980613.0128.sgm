Times News Service dQC ; dLR ; dQL ; NEW YORK _ Eighteen years ago , Wojciech Kozak helped build Trump Tower , the skyscraper jewel in Donald Trump 's real-estate empire .
444 638 Today , Kozak recalls that time with nightmare memories of backbreaking 12-hour shifts and of being cheated with 200 other undocumented Polish immigrants out of meager wages and fringe benefits .
639 861 `` We worked in horrid , terrible conditions , '' Kozak said of the six months he spent in 1980 wielding a sledgehammer and a blowtorch in demolishing the Bonwit Teller Building on Fifth Avenue to make way for Trump Tower .
862 947 `` We were frightened illegal immigrants and did not know enough about our rights . ''
948 1124 Kozak , like other laborers on that job , has no hope of collecting about $ 4,000 in back wages from a contracting company that began the demolition and later became insolvent .
1125 1361 But after almost two decades , the demolition workers are still struggling to compel Trump and his business associates to compensate a union 's welfare funds and thus increase pension and medical benefits for some of the Polish workers .
1362 1580 Kozak is now a party and witness in a class-action lawsuit that has meandered through the federal courts for 15 years and charges that Trump owes $ 4 million to the union welfare funds for the work the Poles performed .
1581 1813 Filed in 1983 , the suit has been bogged down by a torrent of motions and appeals of judicial decisions and by the deaths of a judge , a lawyer , the original lead plaintiffs , an important witness and two of Trump 's co-defendants .
1814 2055 In an effort to resolve the tangled case _ one of the oldest on the civil dockets of the U.S. District Court in Manhattan _ Judge Kevin Duffy last month warned lawyers for both sides to be prepared to begin a jury trial on 48 hours ' notice .
2056 2181 But last Thursday , in a development that could delay the trial yet again , Duffy ordered the case assigned to another judge .
2182 2302 Lawyers for both sides said the 48-hour notice was still in effect , but that it was unclear when the trial would start .
2303 2447 Trump denies that he was aware of the working conditions at the site in 1980 or that any of the demolition workers were undocumented immigrants .
2448 2568 He is also challenging claims that he is liable for payments to the union that were evaded by the demolition contractor .
2569 2777 `` All we did was to try to keep a job going that was started by someone else , '' Trump , in an interview , said of his company 's efforts to guarantee that the demolition contractor paid wages to employees .
2778 2856 `` In fact , we helped people and it has cost a lot of money in legal fees . ''
2857 3076 Kozak and other Polish immigrants who were hired for the demolition said in interviews that they often worked in choking clouds of asbestos dust without protective equipment like safety masks , metal helmets and gloves .
3077 3293 They accepted the conditions because they thought the job would pay 10 times as much as they could earn in Poland , said Kozak , 56 , a slightly built man who became an American citizen and joined a laborers ' union .
3294 3423 Julian Nalepa , 63 , who suffered a head injury in the demolition , said he and fellow workers were baffled by the unending suit .
3424 3504 `` It makes you think that only the rich have rights in the courts , '' he said .
3505 3593 The demolition project on Fifth Avenue and 56th Street lasted from January to June 1980 .
3594 3805 It cleared the way for an ornate 68-story glass-sheathed structure containing shops and an atrium on the lower floors and 263 condominium apartments above that originally sold for $ 500,000 to $ 10 million each .
3806 3952 The tower was financed and built by Trump 's development company , Trump Organization , and Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States .
3953 4210 According to court records and testimony , the Trump-Equitable joint venture hired Kaszycki and Sons Contractors Inc. at a fee of $ 775,000 to raze Bonwit Teller 's 10-story flagship department store although the contractor had little demolition experience .
4211 4573 Demolition Workers Local 95 of the Laborers ' International Union of North America had a collective bargaining agreement with the Kaszycki company , of Herkimer , N.Y. , requiring it to pay specified wages to union and nonunion workers at the Trump Tower site and to make additional payments for each worker into the local 's pension and medical insurance funds .
4574 4875 Wendy Sloan and Lewis Steel , lawyers for current and retired Local 95 members in the suit , assert that William Kaszycki , owner of the contracting company , hired about 200 Polish immigrants who were not Local 95 members and agreed to pay them $ 4 to $ 5 an hour on 12-hour shifts seven days a week .
4876 5051 The Kaszycki company , the plaintiffs said , violated the union 's $ 11-an-hour minimum wage scale and made payments to the local 's welfare funds for only 12 to 15 employees .
5052 5184 The contractor also failed to pay the 200 Poles their full wages , causing work stoppages and delays in destroying the old building .
5185 5459 The plaintiffs contend that Trump was desperate to meet demolition and construction deadlines and that his company in May 1980 began supervising the demolition , assuming full responsibility for adhering to the union contract and for the payments to the union welfare funds .
5460 5563 When the suit was filed in 1983 , the lead plaintiff was Harry Diduck , a dissident member of Local 95 .
5564 5797 Diduck had not worked at Trump Tower but maintained that that he and about 500 Local 95 members and retirees lost medical and pension benefits because Trump-Equitable and the Kaszycki company owed the union funds more than $ 300,000 .
5798 6064 After eight years of arguments and a nonjury trial on some of the issues , in 1991 Judge Charles Stewart of U.S. District Court in Manhattan ruled that Trump and his associates conspired with Local 95 's president , John Senyshyn , to withhold payments to the funds .
6065 6129 He determined that Trump-Equitable owed $ 325,415 plus interest .
6130 6206 Both sides , however , appealed the findings and each won partial victories .
6207 6437 A federal appeals court upheld most of Stewart 's decisions but ruled that Trump-Equitable had been denied a full opportunity to rebut the charge that the funds had been damaged by the loss of contributions for the Polish workers .
