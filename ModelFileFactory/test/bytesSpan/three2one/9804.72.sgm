0 392 9804.72 NEWS STORY SOURCE : The Washington Post SECTION : A26 LENGTH : 876 DATE : April 26 , 1998 HEADLINE : New Deputy at U.N. Will Oversee Reform Process BODY_LEN : 905 UNITED NATIONS - UNITED NATIONS When an ambassadorial committee considering how to overhaul the United Nations meets here Monday , Secretary General Kofi Annan will introduce an important new player in the reform process .
393 518 She is Louise Frechette , a veteran Canadian diplomat chosen by Annan to be the world body 's first deputy secretary general .
519 630 Frechette , 51 , has been at work in the 38th-floor executive offices of the secretariat for more than a month .
631 911 But except for a couple of brief forays into the public eye -- including taking over in Annan 's absence two weeks ago to deliver a sharp protest to the Congolese ambassador over his government 's mistreatment of a U.N. human rights official -- she has remained in the background .
912 1184 `` It is the secretary general , with his concerns about international peace and security , who must be out front in dealing with the individual member states and the Security Council , who handles the politics , the negotiating , the travel , '' she said in an interview .
1185 1366 `` My job is to deal with the inside of the organization -- to get this big , often unwieldly machine to respond to his orders and to see to it that what we promise , we will do . ''
1367 1564 A big part of what Frechette calls `` the frequently tedious tasks of implementation '' will involve her oversight of the reforms that Annan has staked out as the cornerstone of his administration .
1565 1772 He took office a year ago with a pledge to reshape the organization to cope with the challenges of a new century , and on Monday he will announce that he is putting Frechette in charge of the reform program .
1773 1908 High on the list of his proposed changes was a promise to increase greatly the number of women in top U.N. policy and management posts .
1909 2063 Annan 's initial preference for the deputy secretary general job was widely thought to be Sadako Ogata of Japan , the U.N. high commissioner for refugees .
2064 2231 When she opted to stay in that job , he turned to Frechette , a former Canadian ambassador to the U.N. who before returning here was Canada 's deputy defense minister .
2232 2623 Joining Ogata , former Ireland president Mary Robinson , chosen by Annan to head the U.N. human rights commission , and former Norwegian prime minister Gro Bruntland Harland , who with Annan 's support recently was elected head of the World Health Organization , Frechette is part of the most visible and influential presence that women have had in the 52-year history of the United Nations .
2624 2717 She says she intends to put a high priority on ensuring that it is not a fleeting phenomenon .
2718 2903 `` Kofi is very anxious that we send a powerful message to managers that we need to create a pool of qualified women at all levels and to make full use of what they offer , '' she said .
2904 2998 `` It 's not just a question of appointing women who have had distinguished careers elsewhere .
2999 3147 I 'm going to work on our personnel system to ensure that it gives women who join as junior officers the chance to rise on the same terms as men . ''
3148 3276 Ofall the women now holding top-level U.N. posts , Frechette has the job description with the most far-ranging responsibilities .
3277 3559 She will be in charge of reform issues , will be the equivalent of a chief of staff for the cabinet-style management being instituted by Annan , and , since she has to fill in for the secretary general during his travels , she has to be informed about everything on the U.N. agenda .
3560 3621 `` I do n't think I 'll be traveling very much , '' she said .
3622 3677 `` Mostly I wo n't be all that visible from day to day .
3678 3749 My place is to stay behind my desk and make sure that things happen . ''
3750 3909 While it is too early to make any judgments about whether she will succeed , U.N. diplomats and bureaucrats agree that her background gives cause for optimism .
3910 4179 Few people know the inner workings of the United Nations as well as Frechette , who first came here in the 1970s as a junior member of the Canadian delegation and who returned after an extensive diplomatic career to serve as Canada 's ambassador from 1992 through 1995 .
4180 4443 Among her colleagues at the time was the then-U.S. ambassador , Madeleine K. Albright , and the two collaborated closely during the 1994 crisis over Haiti in creating a peacekeeping operation to accompany the return from exile of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide .
4444 4674 When Frechette was picked to be deputy secretary general , a spokesman for Albright , now secretary of state , said she regarded Frechette as one of the finest diplomats she had encountered and a `` perfect choice '' for the post .
4675 4829 `` Actually , what has helped me the most was not my previous U.N. experience but my three years at the Defense Department in Canada , '' Frechette noted .
4830 4947 `` The challenge there was making a big organization produce and perform , and that 's what I 'm expected to do here .
4948 5044 That experience made me better prepared than if I had come straight from being an ambassador . ''
5045 5146 One thing Frechette particularly likes in her change of jobs is the chance to live in New York again .
5147 5222 `` No offense to Ottawa , '' she says , `` but I 'm a real fan of New York .
5223 5339 I think it was most fortuitous that the U.N. founding fathers picked the city rather than some suburb or small town .
5340 5453 You step out on a New York street , and your mind is instantly stimulated by being in touch with all that energy .
5454 5525 I just hope that my job gives me some time now and then to enjoy it . ''
