98 202 People have predicted his demise so many times , and the US has tried to hasten it on several occasions .
203 231 Time and again , he endures .
232 300 He has outlasted and sometimes outsmarted eight American presidents .

354 423 This is clearly an opportunity for Cuba to look good internationally .
