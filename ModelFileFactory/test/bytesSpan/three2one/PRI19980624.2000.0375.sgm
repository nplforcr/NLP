0 295 PRI19980624 .2000.0375 NEWS STORY On the eve of President Clinton 's trip to China , there 's been further pressure on Beijing to come clean on its human rights record , but Chinese authorities are doing all they can to ensure there 'll be no dissent when the president and his entourage arrive .
296 507 Today it was reported that the former Chinese party leader , Zhao Zujang , has written to Chinese communist leaders calling on them to admit it was a mistake to use troops to quell the Tiananmen Square uprising .
508 642 The World 's Rob Gifford in Beijing says no one was surprised by Zhao 's statement that Chinese government owes its people an apology .
643 726 Well , I think uh he would say that , would n't he , is what many people would say .
727 1029 um And uh inevitably he was the party leader who was forced to step down in may of nineteen eighty-nine for siding too much with the students during the demonstrations , but I think what it does show is that there are still people who are willing to speak out , people with some clout like Zhao Zujang .
1030 1379 And if this letter can be confirmed , which is obviously very difficult in Beijing at the moment , some people have said he could emerge as something of a figure head in any opposition movement that were to arise in future , but it must be said that in the current uh circumstances , I do n't see that that is uh seen as a likelihood by many people .
1380 1516 Another sign that people are looking at today is the uh detention of uh a fellow named Li Zhao Long who apparently is a dissident there .
1517 1581 Tell us who he is and what the significance of his detention is .
1582 1616 Well there are people like Mr. Li .
1617 1827 A lot of people have said that with the uh eh - g - the sending of and Wei Jing Chung into exile uh within the last few months , uh that all political opposition has been quashed o - or sent out of the country .
1828 1941 There are people who continue to speak out who are not such high profile dissidents , uh so like m - this Mr. Li .
1942 2144 But I think the important point here is that people like Li , at the moment whatever they say , whatever anybody says , that might rock the boat ahead of Mr. Clinton 's arrival is being clamped down on .
2145 2322 So the government is so keen for nothing to cause problems for this summit , that if anybody makes a squeak that even seems like dissidence , uh they 're going to be stamped on .
2323 2381 What else is the government doing along those lines , Rob ?
2382 2555 After all , a lot of people are going to be watching what the president does , what kind of controls is the government exercising over uh their ability to hear and see that ?
2556 2935 Well , as usual , it 's going to be very uh high security in Tiananmen Square itself , but one of the things that has been reported , again not confirmed , is that uh is that American officials hav - uh have complained to the Chinese about uh the screening of President Clinton 's uh remarks after President Clinton and Mr. Jiang meet in the great hall of the people on Saturday .
2936 3155 That uh there are reports that there 's going to be a twenty-second time delay uh so that anything that is too overtly pro human rights or too anti-China in any way can be edited out so the Chinese people wo n't see it .
3156 3243 I think the ordinary man on the street , he 's not going to get to see much of Clinton .
3244 3388 And to be honest , there seems to be more interest in the soccer world cup at the moment than there is in the visi - visit of President Clinton .
3389 3425 The World 's Rob Gifford in Beijing .
3426 3445 Thanks a lot , Rob .
3446 3460 Thanks , Tony .
3461 3461 .
