Times News Service dLR ; dQC ; dQL ; NEW YORK _ Werner Herzog tells a real-life tall tale in `` Little Dieter Needs To Fly , '' a documentary that describes enough breakneck adventures for any action hero .
558 667 But the swashbuckler who is the film 's subject , Dieter Dengler , mostly describes his exploits from memory .
668 818 Now a garrulous extrovert living a comfortable life near San Francisco , he talks of extraordinary early hardship and of the drive that sustained him .
819 999 With a German childhood seared by images of World War II , and with an American military career that saw him shot down over Laos in 1966 , he has many a hair-raising story to tell .
1000 1125 But as often happens in Herzog 's haunting documentaries , the most interesting figure seems to be the one behind the camera .
1126 1275 Though Dengler is a practiced raconteur and has his story amply illustrated here , it is Herzog 's occasional meditations on his subject that linger .
1276 1385 `` As a child , '' the filmmaker says in voice-over , `` Dieter saw things that made no earthly sense at all .
1386 1451 Germany had been transformed into a dreamscape of the surreal . ''
1452 1524 Starkly poetic images of wartime destruction accompany that observation .
1525 1719 Aerial shots of voluptuous explosions in the jungle amplify Herzog 's idea of what it must have been like for Dengler to be a fighter pilot : `` It all looked strange , like a barbaric dream . ''
1720 1910 `` Little Dieter Needs to Fly , '' which opens on Wednesday at the Film Forum , is one of the filmmaker 's least exotic works , but it straightforwardly presents Dengler 's eventful history .
1911 2054 He speaks of having , as a boy , torn wallpaper off bombed-out walls so that his mother could cook it , since there were nutrients in the glue .
2055 2234 He shows the camera how , even now , memories of being in a prisoner-of-war camp lead him to keep hundreds of pounds of emergency provisions hidden under his house , just in case .
2235 2459 Returning to Southeast Asia with a camera crew -LRB- Herzog enlists villagers and water buffalo to stand impassively before the camera and provide atmosphere -RRB- , Dengler describes his harrowing experiences as a prisoner .
2460 2603 `` They were just always thinking of something to do to me , '' he says of his captors , from whom he ultimately made a highly dramatic escape .
2604 2791 Dengler illustrates how to open handcuffs with a piece of wire , tells of biting a snake in two , even shares a black-tie reunion dinner with the helicopter pilot who finally rescued him .
2792 2895 And in light of his many ordeals , his pleasant chattiness begins to seem the film 's strangest aspect .
2896 2995 As Herzog puts it : `` He hides behind the casual remark that this was the fun part of his life . ''
