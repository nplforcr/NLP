0 457 9801.476 NEWS STORY SOURCE : The Washington Post SECTION : A14 LENGTH : 519 DATE : January 05 , 1998 HEADLINE : Netanyahu and Arafat to Visit White House Separately This Month BODY_LEN : 508 ST. THOMAS , Virgin Islands , Jan. 4 - President Clinton will meet with Israeli and Palestinian leaders separately in Washington later this month in an attempt to revitalize the Middle East peace process that all but died last year , the White House announced today .
458 600 Clinton will host Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu at the White House on Jan. 20 and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat two days later .
601 671 There are no plans to bring the two adversaries together , aides said .
672 800 Clinton has warned both publicly that the peace process is in danger of collapsing if they do not resume full negotiations soon .
801 1056 `` The president thought this was the right time to bring both leaders to Washington to try to move the peace process forward , '' said deputy press secretary Joe Lockhart , who announced the visits here during the final day of Clinton 's winter vacation .
1057 1308 The administration has been trying to push the two sides back on track after months of renewed hostility born out of Israeli housing projects in disputed neighborhoods , stalled West Bank troop redeployments and Arab terrorist attacks in Jewish areas .
1309 1537 With Middle East peace once thought to be a central achievement of his foreign policy , Clinton feels increasingly anxious that the progress he helped bring about may evaporate and leave the volatile region as unsettled as ever .
1538 1764 He was so irritated with what he saw as intransigence by Netanyahu in particular that he declined to meet with the Israeli leader when he was in Washington in November , a move the prime minister later branded an `` insult . ''
1765 2011 Administration officials in Washington said they hope this month 's back-to-back meetings will produce a framework for beginning the next stage of negotiations on `` final status '' issues such as the fate of Jerusalem and a Palestinian homeland .
2012 2184 `` It would be good , but we will see whether there 's enough concrete progress to do that , '' one senior official who insisted on anonymity said in a telephone interview .
2185 2221 `` That 's clearly the objective . ''
2222 2376 Another official , who also declined to be named , said Clinton wants to see tangible movement on the part of both leaders when they arrive in Washington .
2377 2670 `` We 're hoping the prime minister will come with a clear position on further withdrawal -LRB- of troops from disputed territory -RRB- and the timeout -LRB- on housing construction -RRB- -- the two elements we have been talking about with the Israelis since the summer , '' the official said .
2671 2798 From Arafat , he added , Clinton will be `` looking to see if there is continuing concrete performance in security cooperation .
2799 2960 We 're seeing progress in the right direction over the last six months , but that is something that has to be unremitting , and there can be no letdown there . ''
2961 3110 The administration has the impression that both leaders have been nearing the point where they can resume negotiations but have cautiously held back .
3111 3204 A presidential shove , Clinton aides calculate , may be what is needed to break the standoff .
3205 3385 The administration this week is dispatching special Middle East envoy Dennis Ross to the region , where he will meet with both Netanyahu and Arafat and then report back to Clinton .
