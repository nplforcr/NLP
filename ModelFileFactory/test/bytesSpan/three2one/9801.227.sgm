190 464 This Week BODY_LEN : 1064 JERUSALEM , Jan. 18 - Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu is to arrive in Washington to discuss Middle East peace this week after having whittled down expectations so insistently that even any sign of progress may be greeted as a ray of hope .
465 739 His conservative cabinet members spent much of the week preced ing the premier 's departure , set for Monday , elaborating what they would not do to make peace with the Palestinians , where they would not do it and according to what timetable they would see it not get done .
740 991 For Netanyahu , who has long regarded the 1993 Israeli-Palestinian peace accords with distaste -- even though he has pledged to carry them out -- it is nothing new that his political opponents accuse him of dragging his feet on peace or subverting it .
992 1083 What has changed in recent weeks is his government 's standing , and his own hold on power .
1084 1160 Neither seems to bode well for the peace prospects , many analysts here say .
1161 1333 The resignation two weeks ago of Foreign Minister David Levy who , within the rightist cabinet was considered a moderate , set the tone for the cabinet moves that followed .
1334 1614 The departure of Levy , who controls five seats in the Israeli parliament , left the government with a 61-59 parliamentary majority and significantly more susceptible to hard-line pressure , particularly on the land-for-peace formula at the heart of the Middle East peace process .
1615 1876 Many conservatives in the Jewish state long have been uneasy with the land-for-peace trade-off , by which Israel would return Arab territory it captured in 1967 in exchange for guarantees of peace from the Arabs , seeing it as tantamount to forfeiting security .
1877 2104 They say Israel should not withdraw any more troops from the West Bank until the Palestinians make significant progress on a range of security issues , including a crackdown on suspected terrorists operating from the territory .
2105 2246 `` It 's become land for war , land for bloodshed , land for terror , '' David Bar-Illan , a top adviser to Netanyahu , said in an interview .
2247 2390 Guided by that outlook , Netanyahu 's cabinet staked out its position in a series of actions before his meeting Tuesday with President Clinton .
2391 2692 First , the prime minister declared that even if the government decided to go ahead with any pullback of Israeli troops , it would have to wait -- possibly for months -- until the Palestinians complied with previous commitments on security and other matters that Israel contends have not yet been met .
2693 2869 Next , the cabinet published an extensive list of accusations of Palestinian noncompliance , further emphasizing that no withdrawal would occur until the points were addressed .
2870 3063 Finally , the cabinet declared large chunks of the West Bank as areas of Israel 's `` vital interests , '' suggesting they are nonnegotiable in any discussions of an eventual Palestinian state .
3064 3120 Today , the cabinet delayed a decision on the land plan .
3121 3289 Moreover , Israeli officials have said Netanyahu will not present Clinton with a map of the West Bank indicating from what areas Israeli troops might be withdrawn next .
3290 3333 The White House has wanted such a proposal .
3334 3491 The Clinton administration and left-wing critics of Netanyahu in Israel see the Israelis ' moves primarily as bargaining positions but unhelpful nonetheless .
3492 3653 Netanyahu `` has a policy on the peace process -- to keep putting it off and putting it off , '' said Galia Golan , an activist for the advocacy group Peace Now .
3654 3759 `` He was and is opposed to -LRB- the 1993 accords -RRB- and believes in the idea of a Greater Israel . ''
3760 4012 But that did not mitigate the political reality in Israel that has Netanyahu in such a bind -- that any Israeli pullback from significant chunks of West Bank land could cause hard-liners to bolt from the cabinet , triggering the government 's collapse .
4013 4220 `` There is now a paradigm of a weak prime minister who claims not to have enough power to move in a serious direction and can only move incrementally , '' said Yaron Ezrahi , an Israeli political scientist .
4221 4669 `` And this means the Palestinians and Americans must choose between accepting -LRB- a small concession -RRB- and getting as much as one can get at this stage , even if it 's contrary to some expectations and a sense of fairness , or trying to force a conflict that will either strengthen Netanyahu by making him appear as a hero to the Israeli right or destabilize his government with all the uncertainties that new elections and a campaign carry .
4670 4703 It 's a very difficult choice . ''
4704 4910 Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat , scheduled to meet with Clinton two days after Netanyahu , has reacted in generally subdued tones while not hiding his frustration with the Israeli government 's decisions .
4911 5132 At the same time , he has characterized the Washington meetings as a last gasp for the peace process , warning that failure could provoke a renewed popular uprising by the Palestinians against Israeli military occupation .
5133 5312 That warning has been repeated incessantly in the Israeli media , broadcast along with reports that the Palestinians and Israeli forces are covertly preparing for new hostilities .
5313 5474 The reports are dismaying to Jews and Palestinians here , who have been shown by clear majorities in public opinion polls to favor progress in the peace process .
5475 5658 `` It 's easy to say the Arabs are to blame but they 'll just say we 're to blame , '' said Mikhail Bykov , an Israeli in the West Bank settlement of Qiryat Arba , south of Jerusalem .
5659 5707 `` There 's no alternative to the peace process .
5708 5801 If the other side 's making steps toward peace , there 's no reason we ca n't do the same . ''
5802 6037 Mindful of that strand of Israeli public opinion , and its corollary in the United States , Netanyahu has taken pains to launch a full-scale public relations offensive , insisting that he wants progress on peace -- but not at any cost .
6038 6253 In his effort to remind people of a need to press the Palestinians on the issue of terror , Netanyahu is including as part of his official delegation in Washington two relatives of Israelis killed in terror attacks .
6254 6405 One is the widow of a man stabbed three years ago by a Palestinian who is now a police officer in Gaza , according to Bar-Illan , Netanyahu 's adviser .
6406 6536 The other is the mother of a man killed near Jerusalem in 1996 by Palestinians now living in Jericho , in the West Bank , he said .
6537 6659 In both cases , Arafat 's Palestinian Authority has done nothing to bring the killers to justice , according to Bar-Illan .
6660 6869 Arafat , meanwhile , will press his own public relations offensive , meeting with French President Jacques Chirac , Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and other dignitaries on stops before he reaches Washington .
