Times News Service dLR ; dQC ; dQL ; YAMANOUCHI , Japan _ `` ROSS IS THE CHAMPION .
382 404 GIVE THE GOLD BACK ! ''
405 628 The words were written in black marker on a linen hotel napkin , and the young man holding that napkin up i the drizzle at the bottom of the snowboarding halfpipe run this morning was the Canadian rider Michael Michalchuck .
629 721 `` I made it last night because I believe in Ross , '' said Michalchuck , 20 , from Calgary .
722 975 Ross Rebagliati , the Canadian snowboarder who has been stripped of his gold medal in the giant slalom by the International Olympic Committee after testing positive for marijuana , was not one of the spectators Thursday at the Kanbayashi Snowboard Park .
976 1090 But he was unquestionably the central figure as the men 's and women 's halfpipe riders made their Olympic debuts .
1091 1198 `` Ross won fair and square ; he is the gold medalist , and no one can deny him that , '' Michalchuck said .
1199 1244 `` I do n't understand why this is happening .
1245 1307 He is a friend of mine , and he should be given the gold back .
1308 1363 I saw him before this , and he was on top of the world .
1364 1406 This should never have happened to him . ''
1407 1682 Michalchuck decided to make his very public appeal on Wednesday night , and when he finished his opening run , he unstrapped his board , took the napkin from his girlfriend and calmly held it up to the photographers and television camera operators waiting in the finish area .
1683 1786 `` I think the Olympics are good for snowboarding , but I do n't think this whole deal is , '' he said .
1787 1908 `` Marijuana is not a performance-enhancing drug , and Ross did not smoke it ; he was just subjected to it , '' he added .
1909 1948 `` Marijuana is present in every sport .
1949 2050 If it happens to be more present in snowboarding , it may be just because it 's a younger generation .
2051 2130 A lot of us do not smoke it , but I 'm not denying that a lot of my friends do .
2131 2187 You 're not going to change a friend because they do . ''
2188 2253 Michalchuck was not the only Canadian to take an activist stance .
2254 2401 `` In the spirit of snowboarders , we 're not going to sit down on this , '' said Mark Fawcett , one of Rebagliati 's fellow giant - slalom riders .
2402 2469 `` We 're going to try to take the scar and put it back on the IOC .
2470 2500 To come right back at them . ''
2501 2572 Cara-Beth Burnside of the United States said : `` Everyone was furious .
2573 2630 Everyone was , like , Ross won the gold , no matter what .
2631 2686 It was n't anything that was affecting his performance .
2687 2756 I mean , come on , they 're kicking people out for cough medicine . ''
2757 2786 Others were more circumspect .
2787 2921 `` Well , marijuana is on the list , '' said Norwegian Anne Molin Kongsgaard , who added that the disqualification was `` very sad . ''
2922 3124 Some riders also expressed dismay that after waiting for years to show their moves in the Olympics , this issue was now much more interesting to the world than whether they had just performed a McTwist .
3125 3198 `` It 's a weird day , '' said the Canadian team spokesman , Paul Rivard .
3199 3322 `` Because the riders know everybody wants to talk about something other than their run , and they want to stay focused . ''
3323 3348 -LRB- STORY CAN END HERE .
3349 3508 OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS -RRB- The rain that began falling just before the start of the women 's qualifying run certainly did not do much to lighten the mood .
3509 3649 Nor did the Olympic organizers ' questionable decision to allow a relatively small number of fans access to the area bordering the halfpipe .
3650 3802 The bulk of the several thousand fans were instead relegated to a field far down the slope , their view of the halfpipe obstructed by television booths .
3803 3979 `` Usually everybody is right up next to it , '' said Adam Merriman of Vail , Colo. , who traveled to Japan to watch his girlfriend , Barrett Christy , compete in the halfpipe .
3980 4069 `` But then usually there are n't this many television cameras or people around , either .
4070 4097 So I guess that 's good . ''
4098 4230 The teen-age and twentysomething Japanese fans who lined the front row of the roped-off field did not seem to mind their poor seats .
4231 4374 Snowboarding is in fashion with Japan 's trend-conscious youth , and there was no shortage of baggy pants , Airwalk boots and dyed orange hair .
