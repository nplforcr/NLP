560 730 `` We came to Iraq to discuss ... how to implement the enhanced distribution plan and how to speed the process of approval , '' Benon Sevan said as he arrived in Baghdad .
731 832 `` They say give peace a chance , so why do n't we give the distribution plan a chance , '' he added .
833 982 Sevan , a career U.N. officer from Cyprus , said he would meet Iraq 's ministers of trade , health , education `` and all those who are concerned . ''
983 1089 Iraq has been barred from exporting oil under U.N. sanctions imposed after its invasion of Kuwait in 1990 .
1090 1250 The oil-for-food program allows Iraq to export limited amounts of oil under a U.N.-monitored program to raise money to import food and other humanitarian items .
1251 1445 The U.N. Security Council unanimously agreed Friday to allow Baghdad to spend dlrs 300 million of its permitted revenues to buy spare parts for its oil industry to meet increased export targets .
1446 1537 Iraq initially opposed this idea , fearing it would make the program a permanent agreement .
1538 1599 But officials now seem ready to discuss the enhanced program .
1600 1737 The oil-for-food plan permitted Iraq to sell dlrs 2 billion worth of oil every six months when it first was implemented in December 1996 .
1738 1791 That amount was raised to dlrs 5.2 billion this year .
1792 1954 Hours before Sevan 's arrival , a Baghdad newspaper accused U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan of doing nothing to fulfill his promise to get the sanctions lifted .
1955 2146 Al-Thawra , newspaper of the ruling Baath Party , said in a front page editorial that Annan had promised to work for the removal of the embargo in a deal he signed with Iraqi leaders Feb. 23 .
2147 2351 The February deal gave U.N. arms inspectors _ charged with overseeing the elimination of Iraq 's weapons of mass destruction _ unconditional access to all sites in Iraq , including presidential compounds .
2352 2497 The United States and Britain had threatened air and missile strikes if Iraq did not allow the monitors into President Saddam Hussein 's palaces .
2498 2595 Al-Thawra 's editorial reflected Iraq 's frustration over the continuation of the U.N. sanctions .
2596 2671 It was the first time that Iraq had accused Annan of shirking his promises .
