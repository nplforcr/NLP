Times News Service dLR ; dQC ; dQL ; NEW YORK _ The New Jersey Nets ' Jayson Williams walked through Penn Station on Friday afternoon as though he owned the place , signing autographs and kissing tourists .
496 614 But after an hour of signing copies of his Details magazine column , he felt as haggard as a commuter on his way home .
615 878 While the Bulls ' Michael Jordan and the Lakers ' Shaquille O'Neal each anted up the $ 10,000 fine imposed by the National Basketball Association for skipping the news media interview session on All-Star weekend , Williams was only too happy to endure the crowds .
879 984 `` I see why those guys take the fine , why Charles Barkley takes the fine every year , '' Williams said .
985 1008 `` I can understand it .
1009 1037 They 're not from this town .
1038 1154 But I 've got to live here the rest of my life , plus I 'm more of a people person than all those guys put together .
1155 1198 Those guys do n't like being around people .
1199 1252 I like talking to people , getting their opinions . ''
1253 1344 Williams ' day began just after sunrise , when he conducted radio interviews from his home .
1345 1456 By the time he arrived at the New York Hilton to be interrogated by the news media at 4 p.m. , he was dragging .
1457 1705 He had been to Mountainside Children 's Hospital for a video teleconference , he had appearances scheduled with four television stations and a rehearsal for the Team Up Celebration , and was finally heading to MTV 's studios to co-host a live show .
1706 1874 Everybody 's Keeping Busy While Jayson Williams may be the only New Yorker in Sunday 's All-Star game , he 's not alone in running ragged through the city this weekend .
1875 1986 The Knicks ' Patrick Ewing , with his good arm , rang the bell to start trading at the New York Stock Exchange .
1987 2141 The Knicks ' Charles Oakley , may almost be as busy as Williams , even though his only official task is competing in the shoot-around competition tonight .
2142 2296 Oakley was also hosting a comedy show last night , coaching the celebrity all-star game at the Jacob Javits Center and modeling in a charity fashion show .
2297 2313 The Next Jordan ?
2314 2468 Not Yet With Michael Jordan a no-show Friday , the Lakers ' Kobe Bryant was inundated with questions concerning his status as the heir apparent to Jordan .
2469 2507 But Bryant dismissed the talk for now .
2508 2591 `` Michael , Larry Bird and Magic Johnson set such high standards , '' Bryant said .
2592 2660 `` Now they 're talking about the young players carrying the league .
2661 2704 We 're young and we 're just enjoying life .
2705 2730 We 're still learning . ''
2731 2934 Glad -LRB- and Mad -RRB- to Be Here The Pacers ' Reggie Miller was happy to be in New York , the site of many of his proudest moments , even calling it `` the second basketball place , '' behind Indiana .
2935 3075 Asked if he expected to conduct his usual repartee with the film director Spike Lee , he said , `` David Stern went up on the ticket prices .
3076 3129 Spike is n't going to be sitting in the first row . ''
3130 3259 The Lakers ' Nick Van Exel was not thrilled to be in New York , at least after he was the first robbery victim among the players .
3260 3340 `` I was real excited to get here until someone stole my bag , '' Van Exel said .
3341 3363 `` It was my carry-on .
3364 3391 It had all my CDs in it . ''
