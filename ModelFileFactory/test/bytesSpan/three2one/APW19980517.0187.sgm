302 563 dQL ; dUR ; By ERIC TALMADGE dQC ; dUR ; Associated Press Writer dQC ; BIRMINGHAM , England -LRB- AP -RRB- _ Leaders of the world 's most powerful nations ended their annual summit Sunday with an appeal to Pakistan not to respond to India 's nuclear explosions .
564 620 But Pakistan said it will set off its own nuclear blast .
621 860 In a final communique , eight presidents and prime ministers said the challenge they face is to ensure that the benefits of open trade and closer connections between nations worked to `` improve the quality of life of people everywhere . ''
861 985 But the heat of a South Asian nuclear arms race and chaos in financially strapped Indonesia overshadowed the annual meeting .
986 1132 The G-8 leaders condemned the Indian blasts and expressed `` grave concern '' in a special statement that they repeated in their final communique .
1133 1294 But because of reluctance by Russia , Britain , France , Germany and Italy , they failed to endorse sanctions , as urged by the United States , Japan and Canada .
1295 1515 British Prime Minister Tony Blair , at a closing news conference , said the leaders ' decision that `` individual countries will have their own individual responses '' to India 's nuclear tests was the right thing to do .
1516 1739 U.S. President Bill Clinton , in interviews before the close , said it was the strongest statement that could be obtained from the leaders , which also included heads of Russia , Japan , Canada , Italy , Germany and France .
1740 1917 Blair called upon Pakistan to resist entering the nuclear club and upon India to join a global nuclear ban , saying its actions `` gravely weakened the security of the world . ''
1918 2181 `` It is important that they realize the huge international concern that having done these tests now , particularly with what we 're hearing in terms of what Pakistan may do , it is essential that they come within the comprehensive treaty process , '' Blair said .
2182 2451 Pakistan called the Group of Eight effort a `` weak response '' and in Islamabad Sunday , Pakistan Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub told The Associated Press , `` It is a matter of when , not if , Pakistan will test ... The decision has already been taken by the Cabinet . ''
2452 2615 While the communique was full of sweeping generalizations about building a more prosperous world , the talk among the leaders was about the more-immediate threats .
2616 2866 Clinton , in a broadcast interview , said India 's nuclear explosions risked drawing Pakistan , China and Russia into an escalating conflict and both he and Blair , the host for this year 's gathering , appealed for restraint on the part of Pakistan .
2867 3194 `` The answer is not for India to become a nuclear power , and then for Pakistan to match it stride for stride , and then for China to be brought in to support the Pakistanis and move troops to the Indian border , and for Russia to come in and to recreate in a different context the conflicts of the cold war , '' Clinton said .
3195 3222 `` It is a nutty way to go .
3223 3264 It is not the way to chart the future . ''
3265 3441 In their final 10-page communique , released after a closing session today , the leaders stressed that rich nations must work to ensure that global prosperity is widely shared .
3442 3608 They pledged increased efforts to boost health care and education programs in Third World countries and open their markets further to imports from developing nations .
3609 3749 The document stressed the need to make sure the fruits of globalization were more widely shared by all income groups in their own countries .
3750 3934 To that end , the leaders pledged greater efforts toward `` building lasting growth in our own economies in which all can participate , creating jobs and combating social exclusion . ''
3935 4057 The leaders held three days of discussions dominated by the crisis in India and deadly anti-government riots in Indonesia .
4058 4221 Also set for the final day was a meeting between Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin , whose country joined the summit for the first time as a full member .
4222 4425 On Indonesia , Clinton said in an interview broadcast by the BBC that President Suharto , in power for 32 years , must find a way to `` deal with all elements of society on some sort of democratic basis .
4426 4470 ... This is not a hopeless situation yet . ''
4471 4623 Blair , interviewed alongside Clinton , said the turmoil in Indonesia underscored the need for greater financial stability to promote global prosperity .
4624 4809 `` What we can do is try and devise the right architecture for the financial systems of the world which leads to greater stability , more openness and more transparency , '' Blair said .
4810 5015 The G-8 leaders also urged voters in Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic to approve a referendum Friday on a peace deal providing for Catholic-Protestant power-sharing in the troubled British province .
5016 5082 In the BBC interview , Clinton predicted a victory for the accord .
5083 5140 `` All of us have hope and fear inside , '' said Clinton .
5141 5247 `` I think on election day , the clear-headedness of the Irish people will prevail in Northern Ireland . ''
5248 5566 While the G-8 leaders failed to agree on a proposal supported by Blair to erase the debt of the world 's poorest nations , the British prime minister tried to put the best face on the disagreement , insisting that the world 's powers were united in the goal of cutting debt , especially to the poorest African nations .
