391 654 dQL ; dUR ; By ANNA DOLGOV dQC ; dUR ; Associated Press Writer dQC ; MOSCOW -LRB- AP -RRB- _ Presidents Leonid Kuchma of Ukraine and Boris Yeltsin of Russia signed an economic cooperation plan Friday , and Yeltsin claimed they resolved even more nagging problems .
655 761 Russia and Ukraine share similar cultures and languages , and Ukraine was ruled from Moscow for centuries .
762 1007 But while the two Slavic neighbors see themselves as natural partners , their relations since the breakup of the Soviet Union have been bedeviled by a number of disputes _ Black Sea naval bases , border problems and Ukraine 's natural gas debts .
1008 1162 `` We have covered the entire list of questions and discussed how we will be tackling them , '' Yeltsin was quoted as saying by the ITAR-Tass news agency .
1163 1218 `` I must say there are no unsettled problems any more .
1219 1246 We have solved them all . ''
1247 1358 But his sweeping statement contained no details , and gave no indication of how the disputes could be resolved .
1359 1439 Their solution would require a compromise between the two nations ' parliaments .
1440 1564 A major dispute concerns a broad political treaty calling for border demarcation , which the two presidents signed last May .
1565 1712 In effect , the treaty amounts to Russian recognition of Ukraine 's sovereignty and borders , and the Ukrainian parliament has already ratified it .
1713 1904 However , Russia has stalled ratification , trying to tie it to an agreement that would permit the Russian navy to use a naval base on Ukraine 's Crimean peninsula for at least 20 more years .
1905 2138 In their joint statement issued after the talks , Yeltsin and Kuchma called for the fastest possible ratification of the treaty , saying it would create a `` strong legal foundation '' for bilateral ties and help stability in Europe .
2139 2284 Kuchma assured Yeltsin that Ukraine would not join NATO , Yeltsin 's spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said , according to the Interfax news agency .
2285 2384 The Russian leadership has staunchly opposed the western alliance 's expansion into Eastern Europe .
2385 2639 In their joint statement , released by the Kremlin , the two leaders also pledged to consult each other regularly on their approaches to relations with NATO and , in particular , their action within the framework of NATO 's Partnership for Peace program .
2640 2788 Last year , Russian officials assailed Ukraine for holding joint naval exercises with NATO in the Black Sea _ an area Moscow considers its own turf .
2789 2877 Kuchma has said repeatedly that Ukraine would remain neutral for the foreseeable future .
2878 3056 Yeltsin and Kuchma also called for developing the stagnant relations between the members of the Commonwealth of Independent States , a loose coalition of former Soviet republics .
3057 3170 In the past , Russia has often claimed that Ukraine was undermining efforts at closer cooperation within the CIS .
3171 3391 A major goal of Kuchma 's four-day state visit was the signing of a 10-year economic program aimed at doubling the two nations ' trade turnover , which fell to dlrs 14 billion last year , down dlrs 2.5 billion from 1996 .
3392 3563 The two presidents on Friday signed the plan , which calls for cooperation in the metallurgy , fuel , energy , aircraft building , missile , space and chemical industries .
3564 3654 A major project is joint manufacturing of An-70 cargo planes , the Kremlin statement said .
3655 3878 The program also calls for coordination of economic reforms and joint improvement of social programs in the two countries , where many people have become impoverished during the chaotic post-Soviet transition to capitalism .
3879 4007 Kuchma also planned to visit Russian gas giant Gazprom , most likely to discuss Ukraine 's dlrs 1.2 billion debt to the company .
