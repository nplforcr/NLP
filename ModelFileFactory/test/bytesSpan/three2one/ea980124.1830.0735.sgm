0 126 ea980124 .1830.0735 NEWS STORY More on the widening crisis at the White House , specifically its impact on the vice president .
127 257 Al Gore and Bill Clinton are good friends , but in this crisis they may very well find themselves on different sides of the fence .
258 377 As we reported at least one Democrat is already talking about an early Gore presidency , as ABC 's Karla Davis reports .
378 481 There was no press access to the Vice President when he arrived at the White House late this afternoon .
482 566 And Mr. Gore said nothing about the latest scandal in his public speeches this week .
567 653 But his demeanor at a White House photo-op with the President on Thursday said enough .
654 751 Fallout from the latest allegations about the President is hitting the second in command as well .
752 852 It does not do the Democratic party any good , it certainly does n't do the vice president any good .
853 912 And anything that hurts the President hurts his number two .
913 1014 Inside the Beltway , advice to Gore is to remain loyal to his long time friend and political partner .
1015 1068 Well he 's not distancing himself from the President .
1069 1095 And there 's no reason to .
1096 1163 And nor should he from a b - b - blatantly political point of view .
1164 1178 He should n't .
1179 1293 Gore told a group of newspaper columnists this week quote the President has denied the charges , and I believe it .
1294 1370 Otherwise , Mr. Gore has not gone out of his way to comment on this scandal .
1371 1524 His schedule is unchanged , including a dinner here tonight at his residence with House minority leader and one time Clinton opponent , Richard Gephardt .
1525 1561 Karla Davis , ABC News , Washington .
1562 1634 This current crisis has turned into a defining moment for the President .
1635 1754 More and more , his critics are calling on Mr. Clinton to say exactly what he means , and to mean exactly what he says .
1755 1785 Here 's ABC 's Michel McQueen .
1786 1810 Mr. President , welcome .
1811 1945 Adding fuel to the President 's current crisis is the kind of artful dodging over a simple question that has long enraged his critics .
1946 1971 No improper relationship .
1972 2001 Define what you mean by that .
2002 2040 Well , I think you know what it means .
2041 2181 It means that uh that there is not a a sexual relationship , an improper sexual relationship or any other a - kind of improper relationship .
2182 2197 He 's so quick .
2198 2212 He 's so glib .
2213 2263 oh I mean , that 's why they call him Slick Willy .
2264 2404 I mean , w - w - an - they asked him about about the Gennifer Flowers incident , I mean , his his re - his response was no , it 's not true .
2405 2509 And I guess he was referring to the fact that maybe it was n't twelve years , maybe it was eleven years .
2510 2753 And according to sources who have heard the tapes of Monica Lewinsky 's phone conversations , the President 's denial of the affair may hinge on his belief , allegedly described by her in the tapes , that oral sex does not constitute adultery .
2754 2779 I have no memory of that .
2780 2897 It is part of a pattern of nuanced responses to everyday moral dilemmas that has characterized Mr. Clinton 's career .
2898 2992 From questions about drug use The answer to that question is I 've never broken the state law .
2993 3142 And that when I was in England , I experimented with marijuana a time or two , and I did n't like it , and did n't inhale , and never tried it again .
3143 3179 To decisions about military service .
3180 3206 I did not dodge the draft .
3207 3235 I did not do anything wrong .
3236 3384 Whenever there are press conferences , you 're left with a little sort of funny feeling that he was n't leveling , he he was fudging over something .
3385 3514 And remarkable to some , although the pattern has held throughout his presidency , Mr. Clinton has not only survived but thrived .
3515 3548 A tribute to his political skill .
3549 3568 I did n't smoke up .
3569 3695 And very likely in part because many of his generation have engaged in the same kinds of rationalizations about drugs and sex .
3696 3835 Including for example , Virginia Senator Chuck Robb , who when accused of infidelity also said he had not quote slept with the other woman .
3836 3873 For many people , sex is intercourse .
3874 4037 um There 's this high school mentality that people my age and Bill Clinton 's age grew up with , which was that you could do everything but , and it did n't count .
4038 4119 But Mr. Clinton seems to take the evasions a step further than other politicians .
4120 4199 If the story continues , it will be the ultimate test of his verbal gymnastics .
4200 4244 Michel McQueen , ABC News , the White House .
4245 4427 We will have more on the crisis tomorrow morning on This Week with Sam and Cokie , White House reaction to the crisis from one of President Clinton 's closest advisors , Paul Begala .
4428 4492 Plus the lawyer representing Monica Lewinsky , William Ginsburg .
4493 4493 .
