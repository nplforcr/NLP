Times News Service dLR ; dQC ; dQL ; WASHINGTON _ Following is a letter to President Clinton 's personal lawyer , David Kendall , by Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth Starr , as provided by Starr 's office : Your letter of Feb. 6 , 1998 , accusing this office of improperly disclosing information , including grand jury testimony , is strange and inappropriate for three significant reasons .
636 776 First , you elevate mere suspicion to specific accusation without any facts other than the press ' often-misleading attributions of sources .
777 962 Second , the timing of your letter _ arriving in the midst of what appears to be an orchestrated plan to deflect and distract this investigation _ undermines your expression of outrage .
963 1178 Third , we are aware that as of several days ago , the President 's defense attorneys had most , if not all , of the material information -LRB- whether true or not -RRB- set forth in today 's New York Times article .
1179 1339 In my service as independent counsel , particularly with regard to the secrecy of the grand jury , I have insisted on a high commitment to professional conduct .
1340 1391 I have expressed this commitment to you repeatedly .
1392 1485 From the beginning , I have made the prohibition of leaks a principal priority of the Office .
1486 1561 It is a firing offense , as well as one that leads to criminal prosecution .
1562 1718 In the case of each allegation of improper disclosure , we have thoroughly investigated the facts and reminded the staff that leaks are utterly intolerable .
1719 1935 In light of the unclear press attributions in some examples cited in your letter , I have undertaken an investigation to determine whether , despite my persistent admonitions , someone in this office may be culpable .
1936 2032 I have no factual basis _ as you likewise do not have _ even to suspect anyone at this juncture .
2033 2196 I am undertaking this investigation with deep regret , because I know how demoralizing it is to a staff of highly professional and experienced Federal prosecutors .
2197 2324 You do an extreme disservice to these men and women _ and to the legal profession and the public _ by your unsupported charges .
2325 2466 Indeed , the `` facts '' from the press that you cite as evidence of misconduct were , in each case , known to individuals outside my office .
2467 2529 These individuals include witnesses , my lawyers , and others .
2530 2709 Let me cite one noteworthy example : Monica Lewinsky 's attorney , William Ginsburg , has told the world that he was in touch with lawyers on both sides of the pending civil case .
2710 2821 The `` leaks '' that you complain about , thus , may have come from sources close to those under investigation .
2822 3046 Those sources would have a clear and manifest motivation to release harmful information with carefully crafted defenses in order to lessen the painful impact of such evidence when it is revealed through official proceedings .
3047 3215 Finally , your role as private defense counsel and your loyalty to your client does not qualify you to lecture me on professional conduct and my legal responsibilities .
3216 3287 I believe you know where I stand and have always stood on these issues .
3288 3437 Fiercely aggressive representation , including through media grandstanding , can not be an excuse for smearing a lawyer through reckless accusations .
3438 3460 Let 's stick to facts .
3461 3487 Let 's find out the truth .
