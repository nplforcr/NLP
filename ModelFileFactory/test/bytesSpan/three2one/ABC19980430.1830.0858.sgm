0 136 ABC19980430 .1830.0858 NEWS STORY A very strange story about a murder confession appeared today on the front page of The New York Times .
137 204 It is certainly a prominent place for a news story to be displayed .
205 331 But the confession in question , by a man to murdering his five year old daughter , appeared even before that on the Internet .
332 565 We are going to take A Closer Look tonight because the man actually confessed to murder while he was online talking to and , in this case , sharing some of his most personal secrets with people who only knew him through his keyboard .
566 641 First , from ABC 's Aaron Brown , the story of how the murder was revealed .
642 782 For three years , the seventeen hundred residents of Bowman , North Dakota , did n't even suspect a murder had been committed in their town .
783 876 Five year old Amanda Froistad 's death in a fire at her father 's home was ruled an accident .
877 980 And it would have stayed that way had her father , Larry , not allegedly confessed to setting the fire .
981 1091 His purported confession was e-mailed over the Internet to fellow members of a problem drinkers support group .
1092 1158 Froistad wrote , I let her watch the videos she loved all evening .
1159 1275 And when she was asleep , I got wickedly drunk , set our house on fire , went to bed , listened to her scream twice .
1276 1367 Hearing her wheeze in the smoke I could barely stand , looking at her bedroom door burning .
1368 1401 These are things I ca n't forget .
1402 1495 Two hundred members of the group received the message , including Elisa DeCarlo in Manhattan .
1496 1511 And I screamed .
1512 1539 That was my first reaction .
1540 1639 But judging from their e-mails , most others in the group did n't know what to think or what to do .
1640 1827 Wrote group leader Frederick Rogers , a Rutgers university psychologist , We have two responsibilities here , to ourselves as members of this community and to the larger community beyond .
1828 1896 Rogers did not call police and questions whether others should have .
1897 1973 I had no way of knowing for sure whether w - uh what he was saying was true .
1974 2022 Rogers and others decided therapy would be best .
2023 2084 Wrote group member Kay , I do n't think this group is enough .
2085 2131 What a very painful thing in many , many ways .
2132 2208 And others were simply frustrated at the turn their support group had taken .
2209 2262 Wrote one member , Can we please talk about drinking ?
2263 2285 I need your help here .
2286 2361 Only a handful of people who read Froistad 's chilling words called police .
2362 2416 Jim Shirk in Bremerton , Washington , was one of them .
2417 2500 It surprises me that so many saw it differently , and so few uh felt the way I did .
2501 2546 That that surprises me and really saddens me .
2547 2696 Still , the case strongly suggests that many people have come to believe their most personal e-mail communications are both private and confidential .
2697 2803 And that 's something the law does n't allow and the open nature of the Internet can not possibly provide .
2804 2838 Aaron Brown , ABC News , New York .
2839 3003 We were somewhat surprised today that so many members of Larry Froistad 's support group were so openly reluctantly to think of him as a criminal or to turn him in .
3004 3105 And it made us wonder , yet again , whether cyberspace is encouraging a whole new culture to develop .
3106 3156 There are certainly the makings of a new language .
3157 3249 The people who take part in these group discussions are said to post what they 're thinking .
3250 3276 And so , they 're posters .
3277 3311 Those who only listen are lurkers .
3312 3362 Over time , the group may become a virtual family .
3363 3394 All families argue , of course .
3395 3476 And if you raise your voice in cyberspace argument , you type in capital letters .
3477 3510 That is shouting on the Internet .
3511 3577 When you insult another person , you are said to have flamed them .
3578 3681 You can apologize with an emoticon , an emotional expression made by combining symbols on the keyboard .
3682 3762 It actually looks more familiar to many of us when you actually put it this way .
3763 3812 But is there a different mindset on the Internet ?
3813 3950 We have been talking to Dr. Kimberly Young , who specializes in neuropsychology , including something called Internet addiction disorder .
3951 4083 Dr. Young , is the Internet and these groups really a special place with a different culture , or are they just like the rest of us ?
4084 4176 Well , on one hand , the Internet does reflect , I think , a lot of what society represents .
4177 4266 On the other hand , it it does have a culture all of its own , its own separate language .
4267 4408 What 's interesting is that what might take you and I months or years to develop an intimate relationship may only take days or weeks online .
4409 4583 Um the fact that you 're anonymously communicating with other people uh allows you sort of the freedom of expression that goes deeper than sort of face-to-face communication .
4584 4661 So subjectively , people feel quite intimate online in just a matter of days .
4662 4687 But confessing to murder ?
4688 4781 Well , many times people find this sort of safe behind the safety behind the computer screen .
4782 4927 They find that um in general it seems that they can say things , and often times I find people forget that they 're talking to other real people .
4928 5051 It 's sort of like journaling in a notepad , but an electronic one where other people are are reading what you 're writing .
5052 5154 So sometimes that compels us to say things we normally would n't say or to be more uninhibited online .
5155 5210 Well , Dr. Young , in real life , you 're very helpful .
5211 5238 Well , thank you very much .
5239 5259 Thank you very much .
5260 5392 Larry Froistad , the man who got us thinking about all this today , will be arraigned tomorrow in North Dakota on charges of murder .
5393 5393 .
