437 882 dQL ; -LRB- kd -RRB- dQL ; dUR ; By DAVID JOHNSTON dLR ; dQC ; dQL ; dUR ; c. 1998 N.Y. Times News Service dLR ; dQC ; dQL ; WASHINGTON _ After a year of resisting an independent campaign finance inquiry , Attorney General Janet Reno changed direction Wednesday , formally asking a judicial panel to appoint an outside prosecutor to investigate Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt 's role in his agency 's action to kill an Indian gambling project .
883 1120 Reno asked the panel to instruct the new counsel , the sixth one to be appointed during the Clinton administration , to look at whether Babbitt lied to Congress and whether the decision to kill the project was `` criminally corrupted . ''
1121 1362 But the charter she proposed for the Babbitt inquiry was notably narrow in scope , and would not permit the new independent counsel the latitude to investigate broader campaign fund-raising issues , as many prominent Republicans have sought .
1363 1565 Reno 's decision comes at a hard time for the White House , creating a second front of vulnerability at the same time President Clinton 's aides battle another independent prosecutor , Kenneth W. Starr .
1566 1692 He is conducting the investigation into the president 's relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky , the former White House intern .
1693 1855 The appointment of the fourth independent prosecutor to investigate one of Clinton 's Cabinet officers , is the first outside inquiry into political fund-raising .
1856 2115 At the least , it threatens Babbitt and his aides to a time-consuming , expensive and potentially threatening inquiry into whether Babbitt 's agency killed the Chippewa casino project in Hudson , Wisc. , in return for campaign contributions from rival tribes .
2116 2312 Babbitt said Wednesday that he was disappointed by the decision and that the Interior Department 's action on the Indian project `` was the right one , made on the merits for the right reasons . ''
2313 2544 `` Those who made the decision have testified unanimously that they were not influenced by improper political pressure , '' he said in a statement released by his office Wednesday afternoon while he was traveling to the Everglades .
2545 2769 `` If it 's true that only an independent counsel can resolve a matter like this if it involves a cabinet secretary , then I think the list of hidden costs one has to pay for public service has just grown a little longer . ''
2770 2832 Clinton expressed confidence that Babbitt would be exonerated .
2833 2878 `` I have known Bruce Babbitt for many years .
2879 2945 He is a man of the highest integrity and dedicated public servant .
2946 3042 I am convinced that when this matter is concluded he will be vindicated , '' the president said .
3043 3113 `` I look forward to his continuing service to the American people . ''
3114 3139 -LRB- STORY CAN END HERE .
3140 3428 OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS -RRB- Other Clinton cabinet members to undergo independent counsel scrutiny are former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy , former Housing Secretary Henry Cisneros , and former Commerce Secretary Ron Brown , who died in April 1996 when his plane crashed in Croatia .
3429 3535 Another independent counsel investigated Eli Segal , the head of Americorp , but decided not to prosecute .
3536 3735 Reno also rejected efforts to appoint counsels to investigate allegations against two other cabinet officers , former Transportation Secretary Federico Pena and former Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary .
3736 4038 The Babbitt inquiry comes on the heels of the first indictments in the Justice Department 's campaign finance investigation , with Democrats facing the prospect that prosecutors would try to seek the cooperation of one defendant , Yah Lin Trie , a prominent fund-raiser and friend of President Clinton .
4039 4150 Reno 's decision also comes at a moment of furious debate over the legitimacy of independent counsel inquiries .
4151 4311 Clinton 's aides have bitterly attacked Starr for roaming far beyond his original mandate , probing the Whitewater land deal , to investigate the Lewinsky case .
4312 4401 They blame Starr for improperly leaking confidential information obtained in his inquiry .
4402 4815 If Starr 's widening inquiry exemplifies how independent prosecutors extend their jurisdictional boundaries , Republicans have hoped that the Babbitt inquiry would be a spear-point for a much broader campaign finance investigation into the frenzy of Democratic fund-raising in the 1996 campaign along with related unresolved issues , like whether the Chinese government improperly influence the political process .
4816 4991 But Reno appeared Wednesday to have attempted to head off any such effort by the Babbitt independent prosecutor , who will be named not by Reno , but by the three judge panel .
4992 5122 Reno left scant room for the independent prosecutor to roam freely , narrowly wording the charter to limit the inquiry to Babbitt .
5123 5148 -LRB- STORY CAN END HERE .
5149 5371 OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS -RRB- -LRB- MORE -RRB- nn The decision to open the inquiry into Babbitt , the former Arizona governor who unsuccessfully sought the presidency in 1988 , was a painful choice for Reno , aides said .
5372 5529 The decision was not based on her assessment of the evidence against Babbitt , but on the law itself which left her no room to avoid seeking the appointment .
5530 5593 In Babbitt 's case , the available evidence seems inconclusive .
5594 5710 Babbitt has said repeatedly that he played no role in the Interior Department 's decision to deny the casino permit .
5711 5877 But a lawyer lobbying in behalf of the Chippewa group that sought the project has said Babbitt told him of a concerted White House lobbying effort to thwart the deal .
5878 6024 Nevertheless , the law requires Reno to go forward with an independent counsel if she can not resolve whether the subject may have broken the law .
6025 6264 In the case of Babbitt , the Justice Department can not use investigative techniques , like compelling testimony before a grand jury , that it would almost certainly employ if the subject was not covered by the Independent Counsel statute .
6265 6457 Interior officials in Washington rejected the Chippewa casino permit in 1995 after a group of rival tribes hired a high-powered Democratic lobbyist , Patrick O'Connor , to overturn the permit .
6458 6614 O'Connor had important contacts at the White House , like Harold M. Ickes , the former deputy chief of staff and Bruce Lindsey , the presidential counselor .
6615 6833 In 1996 , after the Interior Department killed the project , the Democrats received $ 230,000 in contributions from the tribes whose own gaming ventures might have lost business had the Department approved the project .
6834 6968 Republican lawmakers said the permit issue stood out as a clear-cut case of a government favor in exchange for campaign contributions .
6969 7040 The casino decision itself is not under direct scrutiny in the inquiry .
7041 7190 Instead , the independent prosecutor will focus on perjury and the truthfulness of statements made by Babbitt to lawmakers about the permit decision .
7191 7325 Babbitt 's statements conflict with those of a lobbyist , Paul F. Eckstein , a former law school classmate and law partner of Babbitt .
7326 7454 The Chippewas hired Eckstein as a lobbyist in an effort win approval of the permit on the site of failed dog track in Wisconsin .
7455 7528 On the day of the permit decision , Eckstein talked briefly with Babbitt .
7529 7625 By Eckstein 's account , Babbitt told him that Ickes had ordered a quick resolution of the case .
7626 7761 Eckstein added that the secretary had also asked whether his old friend was aware how much the prevailing Indian group had contributed .
7762 7850 When first asked about the remarks , Babbitt denied to a senator that he ever made them .
7851 7943 Later , after the casino issue ignited into a potential scandal , Babbitt changed his story .
7944 8085 Babbitt admitted that he had mentioned Ickes ' name , but only as a kind of closing comment to excuse himself from the meeting with Eckstein .
8086 8311 `` I never spoke with Mr. Ickes about the Hudson matter , and I should n't have given Mr. Eckstein any reason to suppose that I had , '' Babbitt said in testimony about the issue to a House investigating committee on Jan. 29 .
8312 8335 `` I regret the remark .
8336 8353 It was a mistake .
8354 8385 But that 's all that it was . ''
