37 130 The Secretary of State was in Spain today talking to the Russian foreign minister about Iraq .
131 152 Here 's the question .
153 300 Are these consultations with the allies really meaningful , or has the Clinton administration decided already that Saddam Hussein will be attacked ?
301 328 Here 's ABC 's David Ensor .
329 478 After nearly two hours of talks , Secretary of State Albright said she had heard nothing to convince her that the Russians can get Iraq to back down .
479 559 Patience is running out , ah and that the diplomatic route is all but exhausted .
560 653 But she 's said that kind of thing before , and the Russian foreign minister still disagrees .
654 705 We 're we 're a little bit more patient , you know .
706 796 For now , the US strategy is simple , daily threats and warnings that time is running out .
797 846 As for when it really will run out , not so fast .
847 895 Cabinet members still have some traveling to do .
896 1088 After meeting here tonight with Jordan 's King Hussein , Secretary Albright will go to the Middle East and the Gulf , asking the Saudis to allow US planes to use their bases for bombing raids .
1089 1209 And officials say it would simply not be feasible to bomb Iraq with Defense Secretary William Cohen out of the Pentagon .
1210 1298 He 's got a Middle East tour , too , and wo n't be home until at least February twelfth .
