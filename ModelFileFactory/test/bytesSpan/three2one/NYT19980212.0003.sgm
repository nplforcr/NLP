Times News Service dLR ; dQC ; dQL ; NAGANO , Japan _ An arbitration panel met Thursday to decide whether to return a gold medal to a Canadian snowboarder or to uphold the International Olympic Committee 's decision to take the medal away because the athlete tested positive for marijuana .
592 637 No decision had been reached by late morning .
638 835 Ross Rebagliati of Canada had his gold-medal-winning performance nullified on Wednesday after the IOC 's medical commission voted , 13-12 , and the IOC 's executive board voted , 3-2 , against him .
836 1051 The Canadian Olympic Association appealed , noting that the rules of the international ski federation say that a penalty may be imposed for a positive marijuana test but do not stipulate that a penalty is mandatory .
1052 1108 `` Is , or should , the IOC be a social police force ? ''
1109 1162 asked Carol Ann Letheren , an IOC member from Canada .
1163 1207 `` That is the question around this drug . ''
1208 1407 There has long been a debate in the IOC about whether marijuana should be on the banned substances list because it is not generally considered a performance-enhancing drug , as are anabolic steroids .
1408 1566 `` If it 's not performance-enhancing , and it 's a social drug , you wonder why it is included , '' said an IOC official who spoke on condition of anonymity .
1567 1634 `` But it 's a question of , do you follow the rules or do n't you ?
1635 1732 How do you tell your children not to use drugs and then say it 's OK if it 's a gold medalist ? ''
1733 1821 The case has spawned wicked humor worldwide and serious interest by the Japanese police .
1822 1978 Kyodo , the Japanese news service , said that the Japanese police would question Rebagliati and would ask the IOC to turn over the results of his drug test .
1979 2069 Possession of marijuana can carry a sentence of up to five years in jail , Kyodo reported .
2070 2202 Michele Verdier , a spokeswoman for the IOC , said she did not know if the committee had turned over the test results to the police .
2203 2295 `` I see no reason why the IOC would not cooperate with local authorities , '' Verdier said .
2296 2465 Letheren said that Rebagliati told officials he had not smoked marijuana since April 1997 and that he believed the drug had entered his system through second-hand smoke .
2466 2582 In the Canadian press , the case has spawned `` Up in Smoke '' headlines and such one-liners as `` Oh , Cannabis ! ''
2583 2740 The rescinding of Rebagliati 's medal has also underscored the chaotic nature of drug enforcement within the various sports federations that make up the IOC .
2741 2782 Not every federation tests for marijuana .
2783 3095 And some believe that the IOC is embarrassing itself by disqualifying an athlete for a drug that is not considered performance-enhancing when it does not even have certified tests for two drugs that are performance-enhancing and are suspected of widespread use _ human growth hormone and erythropoietin , or EPO .
3096 3121 -LRB- STORY CAN END HERE .
3122 3288 OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS -RRB- Mark Fawcett , a close friend and teammate of Rebagliati 's on the Canadian snowboarding team , said : `` This whole thing is a farce .
3289 3325 Nobody can understand what happened .
3326 3449 As athletes , we have never been informed that if we are in a situation where someone is smoking weed , we should leave . ''
3450 3557 Frank Carroll , coach of American figure skater Michelle Kwan , said : `` I know it is a destructive thing .
3558 3610 If you are an athlete , you have to make a decision .
3611 3667 Are you going to do that sort of thing or be an athlete ?
3668 3709 I do n't think there is room for both . ''
3710 3949 The arbitration panel deciding Rebagliati 's case is part of the Court of Arbitration for Sport , an independent body based in Lausanne , Switzerland , that is set up to decide legal arguments that arise during the Winter and Summer Games .
3950 4102 Three arbiters deciding the case are Richard Young , an attorney from Colorado Springs , Colo. ; Jan Paulsson of Sweden , and Maria Zuchowicz of Poland .
4103 4171 They were chosen for their experience in arbitration and sports law .
