Times News Service dLR ; dQC ; dQL ; GARDEN CITY , N.Y. _ Clearing an important hurdle , Gov. George Pataki Wednesday won a federal agency 's approval of his plan for a $ 7.8 billion partial state takeover of Long Island Lighting Co. , a proposal that is intended to cut electricity rates by an average of 19.4 percent .
611 757 Pataki 's aides said the approval , which was granted unanimously by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in Washington , was a major advance .
758 848 The commission 's ruling is among several Government approvals required to enact the plan .
849 1109 But the plan 's entrenched foes seized on a companion decision by the commission in which it ordered hearings on whether to approve the wholesale prices that Lilco would charge for the power its generating plants would supply to the state in the takeover plan .
1110 1202 The critics vowed to continue their fight on that issue and in other regulatory proceedings .
1203 1340 The governor , who is running for a second term , faces a practical deadline for reaping the maximum political benefit from the takeover .
1341 1579 He hopes to complete the complex deal by November _ in time to issue a pre-election cut in electricity bills and to mail all customers refund checks of $ 101 apiece in Suffolk County and $ 232 in Nassau County and the Rockaways in Queens .
1580 1710 That would be a campaign coup for Pataki , who owed much of his 1994 election victory margin to his strong showing on Long Island .
1711 1835 He promised to confront Lilco 's electric bills _ now the highest in North America _ which rank as a top voter concern here .
1836 1988 Under the Pataki plan , the state 's Long Island Power Authority would buy Lilco 's transmission and distribution lines and customer service operations .
1989 2125 Lilco would be hired to manage the system and supply power for several years before those functions would be opened to competitive bids .
2126 2298 The savings would derive from tax-exempt bonds to refinance Lilco 's debt , including the cost of its abandoned nuclear plant at Shoreham , and from postponed debt payment .
2299 2495 But the critics , who include a bipartisan core of state and county legislators in Suffolk as well as several civic , environmental and business groups , assert that the Pataki plan is a bad deal .
2496 2714 They say it benefits Lilco stockholders , bails out the Shoreham fiasco , burdens electricity customers with more than $ 20 billion in debt and stifles competition just when the rest of the nation is being deregulated .
2715 2806 Richard M. Kessel , the chairman of the Long Island Power Authority , praised the approval .
2807 2889 `` This is clearly a major step forward for the governor 's plan , '' Kessel said .
2890 3055 `` We 're hopeful that we can close the transaction soon , so electric consumers on Long Island can begin to benefit from lower electric rates in the near future . ''
3056 3081 -LRB- STORY CAN END HERE .
3082 3322 OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS -RRB- But one opponent of the plan , Wayne Prospect , a former Suffolk County legislator and now a consultant to the Hauppauge Industrial Association , accused Kessel of distorting the energy commission 's actions .
3323 3449 `` What Lipa is trying to do , shamelessly , is tell the public this is a done deal when it is far from it , '' Prospect said .
3450 3638 In a draft of its order for a review of prices in the power-supply contract , the five-member energy commission said hearings were necessary to protect the interests of Lilco 's customers .
3639 3851 `` Our preliminary analysis of the proposed rate indicates that it has not been shown to be just and reasonable , and may be unjust , unreasonable , unduly discriminatory or preferential or otherwise unlawful . ''
3852 3961 Although the commission 's hearings could take months , Kessel said that its review was a standard procedure .
3962 4159 He said there was nothing to stop the governor 's plan from proceeding in advance of the hearings , with retroactive adjustments made according to anything that the federal commission might impose .
4160 4319 Although Kessel claimed that the commission 's review could not upset the governor 's plan , the opponents disputed him and said the plan was still vulnerable .
4320 4456 Now the plan 's proponents are focusing on their next goal of winning favorable rulings from the Internal Revenue Service , Kessel said .
4457 4607 Pataki is bolstered by the bipartisan support of New York 's two senators , Daniel Patrick Moynihan , a Democrat , and Alfonse D'Amato , a Republican .
4608 4666 The governor 's plan seems to have gained momentum lately .
4667 4858 Last week , the state Public Service Commission approved Lilco 's planned merger with Brooklyn Union Gas , which advocates consider an allied move that will add to the potential rate savings .
4859 4982 While opposition to the Pataki plan has grown in Suffolk , bipartisan backing for it is now emerging in neighboring Nassau .
4983 5169 In a rare split between the two counties , Nassau officials last month went to court supporting the plan as intervenors in litigation filed by the Suffolk County Legislature to block it .
