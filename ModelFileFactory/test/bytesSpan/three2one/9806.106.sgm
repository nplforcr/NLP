0 457 9806.106 NEWS STORY SOURCE : The Washington Post SECTION : A15 ; LENGTH : 753 DATE : June 24 , 1998 HEADLINE : Ex-Deputy Tapped to Lead FDA ; Stirring of Opposition Greets Clinton Choice BODY_LEN : 728 President Clinton yesterday nominated a University of New Mexico administrator to take over the contentious post of commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration , and the nomination immediately drew hints of opposition from some members of the Senate .
458 723 Clinton selected Jane E. Henney , vice president for health sciences at the University of New Mexico , a doctor and cancer specialist who has worked at the National Cancer Institute and served as a deputy to then-FDA Commissioner David A. Kessler from 1992 to 1994 .
724 805 If confirmed , Henney , 51 , would be the first woman to become FDA commissioner .
806 1049 Clinton urged quick Senate action on the long-awaited nomination , saying that senators `` will conclude that she is extremely well qualified to serve as commissioner as the agency prepares itself to meet the challenges of the 21st century . ''
1050 1159 FDA officials said that Henney would not be available for comment until the confirmation process is complete .
1160 1398 Through a spokeswoman , Henney said : `` There is no greater honor than to be asked to return to public service and to lead the FDA , an agency that plays such a vital role in protecting and promoting the health of the American people . ''
1399 1460 The nomination comes as the FDA faces a number of challenges .
1461 1561 The agency , which regulates 25 cents of every dollar consumers spend , is more prominent than ever .
1562 1712 It bears responsibility for ensuring that drugs are safe and effective , and has a major role in maintaining the safety of foods and the blood supply .
1713 1828 In addition , the agency faces an often-hostile Congress , which last year passed extensive FDA reform legislation .
1829 2008 That alone presents a daunting task for the agency , which must now produce a shelf of new regulations , `` guidances '' and other publications to fulfill the mandates of the law .
2009 2242 Henney would bring strong skills to such a task , having had much to do with the FDA 's implementation of landmark 1992 legislation that set up a user fee system that dramatically shortened review times of new drugs , officials said .
2243 2371 `` She 's a lot more qualified than anyone who 's ever taken the job before , '' including Kessler , said a senior FDA official .
2372 2449 Kessler yesterday called Henney `` one of the best physician-managers I know .
2450 2519 She 's her own person and will do a wonderful , do a terrific job . ''
2520 2688 Since Kessler left the agency more than a year ago to head the Yale University Medical School , the FDA has been run by its lead deputy commissioner , Michael Friedman .
2689 2839 Representatives of industries FDA regulates said yesterday that they knew little about Henney but hoped to learn more during the confirmation process .
2840 2991 `` This is as important a nomination as the FDA has ever had in its history , '' said Carl Feldbaum , head of the Biotechnology Industries Association .
2992 3218 Any new commissioner has to plot a careful middle course , Feldbaum said , between `` people in the agency who want no change or slow change '' and some people in industry and Congress `` who think any change is beneficial . ''
3219 3264 Senators said they will vet Henney carefully .
3265 3305 Sen. James M. Jeffords -LRB- R-Vt . -RRB-
3306 3512 , who chairs the Labor and Human Resources Committee , which will consider the nomination , said : `` It is not going to be a quick one , '' because senators have already raised questions about the nominee .
3513 3606 He predicted that hearings are unlikely before the end of July and `` probably much later . ''
3607 3753 Aides to several Republican senators wanted to know if Henney played a role in the agency 's promotion of RU-486 , the French `` abortion pill . ''
3754 3796 Sen. Edward M. Kennedy -LRB- D-Mass . -RRB-
3797 3923 , who championed Henney 's nomination , said , `` She knows the issues , she knows the agency , and she 's a proven leader . ''
3924 4116 While Kennedy made no reference to controversy over the nomination , a Democratic staffer acknowledged , `` Anyone who follows in Dr. Kessler 's footsteps is going to get a lot of scrutiny . ''
4117 4282 Another source said that senators know little about her but that her service under Kessler and strong support from Kennedy may raise concerns among some Republicans .
4283 4426 Kessler brought an unusually high profile to the post with his agenda , which included asserting FDA authority over tobacco for the first time .
4427 4641 But he also became a symbol of over-aggressive government for some members of Congress because of some of his actions , such as his attempt to crack down on health claims made for foods and nutritional supplements .
4642 4805 A senior administration official predicted that Henney would ultimately gain confirmation in the Senate : `` She comes to this job with a broad base of support . ''
