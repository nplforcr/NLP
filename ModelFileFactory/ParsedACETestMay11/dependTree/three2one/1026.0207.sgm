Based on analyses of birth certificates of the nearly 35 million babies born in this country from 1983 to 1991 and the death certificates of those who died before their first birthdays , the researchers determined that 2,776 of the infants were homicide victims .

One reason we 're seeing higher risk in second or later babies is the added stress of taking care of more children , '' said Dr. Mary D. Overpeck , the lead author .
