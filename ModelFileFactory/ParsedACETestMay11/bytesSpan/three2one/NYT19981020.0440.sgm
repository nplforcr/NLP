Times News Service dQC ; dLR ; dQL ; CEDAR RAPIDS , Iowa _ This is crunch time in the 1998 campaign season , and no Democrat is likely to be hammering Republicans around the country more extensively than Vice President Al Gore in the two weeks remaining before the Nov. 3 elections .
685 1011 With Democrats sensing improved chances and President Clinton cutting back his travel to accommodate developments like the Middle-East negotiations in Wye Mills , Md. , Gore has become the administration 's busiest spokesman on the campaign trail , defending Clinton 's policies , criticizing the opposition and raising money .
1012 1224 The strategy continued Tuesday in Illinois and Iowa , where the vice president made nine campaign appearances in five cities before flying on to New Mexico and California for more speeches over the next two days .
1225 1339 Between now and the elections , aides say he could visit as many as a dozen states _ more , if Clinton stays home .
1340 1512 In large measure , Gore is focusing on tightly contested House races , or at least those in which a Democrat would have a better chance of winning if the turnout were high .
1513 1618 And if a Democratic candidate for governor needs help , as Tom Vilsack does in Iowa , so much the better .
1619 1818 Vilsack , a state lawmaker who is challenging Jim Lightfoot , a Republican , to succeed Gov. Terry Branstad , a Republican who is retiring , accompanied Gore at each of his six stops Tuesday in Iowa .
1819 1914 `` I do n't think we 're going to break any new ground on the issues , '' an aide to Gore said .
1915 1943 `` The focus now is turnout .
1944 2032 We have to bring up the level of enthusiasm , raise the level for grass-roots intensity .
2033 2095 We 've made our arguments ; we just have to reinforce them . ''
2096 2298 Traveling around Iowa has an added benefit for Gore because , as the probable Democratic front-runner to succeed Clinton , he can expand his base in the state that holds the first presidential caucuses .
2299 2469 It has only been in recent weeks that Democrats have found evidence through recent polls that the midterm elections might produce something less than a disaster for them .
2470 2778 Early predictions that the impeachment inquiry against Clinton would cause Democrats to lose scores of seats in the House have largely given way to more optimistic expectations , perhaps a loss of fewer than 34 , the historical average for the party in the White House in the sixth year of an administration .
2779 3069 Part of the reason , Gore said at a rally in Davenport for Bob Rush , the Democrat challenging Rep. Jim Leach , an 11-term Republican incumbent , is that Democrats perceive voters as angry that Congress spent too much time on the Clinton sex scandal at the expense of important legislation .
3070 3207 It is not a new thought as part of Gore 's standard stump speech , which stresses education , health care and preserving Social Security .
3208 3265 But his expanding emphasis on Republican scandal-lust is .
3266 3526 In recent days , Gore has been refining the core of his criticism with a suggestion that voters should make the impeachment proceedings an Election Day referendum , a change from several months ago when Democrats feared the scandal would bury them in the fall .
3527 3800 `` We say , let 's put it to a vote of the American people , '' as Gore said in Moline , Ill. , campaigning for Rep. Lane Evans , an eight-term Democrat facing a strong challenge from Mark Baker , a former television newsman and a Republican in his second bid for election .
