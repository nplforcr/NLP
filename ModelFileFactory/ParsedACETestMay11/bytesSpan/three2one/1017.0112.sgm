PADRES -- NOTEBOOK ; Braves Lack the Finish Of a Great Champion The Atlanta Braves are not playing in New York this weekend , which means they are not playing in the World Series for the third time in their seven-season run as a division champion and therefore will not win the World Series for the sixth time in those seven seasons .
491 858 Although the Braves , whose streak goes back to 1991 -LRB- and does not include the strike-shortened 1994 season , remain the most consistently good team of the 90 's -- the enduringly best since the 1949-64 Yankees -- something has to be missing from the mix that gets them to the post-season year after year , at least something that rears its ugly head in October .
859 1132 Conversations with officials from several other clubs elicited views that could explain the Braves ' problem this way : The Braves ' starting pitching , the best and deepest in the major leagues , dominates in the regular season because no team can match the starting five .
1133 1245 In the playoffs , however , rotation depth is less critical , and other teams usually have three solid starters .
1246 1376 With that advantage neutralized , the Braves need more help from their hitters and fielders , and they do n't get it often enough .
1377 1469 Moreover , errors and other defensive lapses have undermined the Braves ' ability to win . ''
1470 1612 One thing the Braves have that no one else has is depth in the starting rotation , '' said Dave Dombrowski , the Marlins ' general manager . ''
1613 1669 Over a 162-game season , that is very difficult to beat .
1670 1736 I do n't think you can beat them unless you match up the same way .
1737 1835 But in a short series most clubs you 're playing are going to throw three quality starters at you .
1836 1870 The fifth starter is not a factor .
1871 1920 The fourth starter may or may not be a factor . ''
1921 2041 The rest of the team , however , falls short of their pitching in championship status , another general manager said . ''
2042 2188 They 're not that good a club if you take away their starting pitching , '' said the general manager , who spoke on the condition of anonymity . ''
2189 2287 If you put their starting pitching on several National League clubs , those clubs would be better .
2288 2322 Their bullpen is ordinary at best .
2323 2356 Their defense is average at best .
2357 2451 If they do n't hit home runs , they 're going to struggle because they 're not going to score .
2452 2524 They 've done it with starting pitching and timely hitting for years . ''
2525 2699 An executive of another club suggested that the Braves spend so much money on their starting pitchers that they do n't have much left to spend on bolstering their hitting . ''
2700 2750 Maybe they have four good hitters , '' he said . ''
2751 2831 If the other team 's pitching can neutralize those hitters , they can beat them .
2832 2961 If you pitch well against them , you have a good chance of beating them because their offense and their bench are n't that great .
2962 3037 If you match up with starting pitching , you can neutralize their power . ''
3038 3149 In the league championship series , the San Diego Padres ' pitchers shut down most of the Braves ' key hitters .
3150 3245 Andres Galarraga had two hits in 21 at-bats for a .095 batting average and four runs batted in .
3246 3299 Ryan Klesko had one hit in 12 tries -LRB- .083 -RRB- .
3300 3400 Chipper Jones batted a relatively torrid .208 but drove in a single run , matching Klesko 's output .
3401 3612 Andy Ashby held the Braves to 1 run in 7 innings in the first game , Kevin Brown shut them out on 3 hits in the second and Sterling Hitchcock stymied them in two starts , allowing 1 run and 5 hits in 10 innings .
3613 3668 The Braves have also had critical defensive breakdowns .
3669 3813 They hurt the Braves in the league series against Florida last October , and a relative flood of errors killed them against San Diego this year .
3814 4035 From the double error by Andres Galarraga on one play in the first game to Danny Bautista 's muffed catch of a fly ball in the last , the Braves self-destructed in the series that sent the Padres to New York this weekend .
4036 4108 Eight errors in six games is not the formula for post-season success . ''
4109 4161 There are no perfect clubs , '' Dombrowski observed .
4162 4248 But he added , '' You tip your cap to the Braves because they 're there every year . ''
4249 4419 Gerry Hunsicker , Houston 's general manager , has experienced the post-season the past two seasons and was not ready to find fault with the Braves for their latest loss .
4420 4506 He gave credit to the Padres , who also defeated the Astros in the division series . ''
4507 4598 I think the Padres were an overlooked team coming into the playoffs , '' Hunsicker said . ''
4599 4620 They were underrated .
4621 4718 This is a team that for four and a half months was arguably the best team in the National League .
4719 4794 Suddenly , in September , they had a slide and everybody forgot about them .
4795 4846 We got Randy Johnson and the hype got carried away .
4847 4910 The impact Randy would have on our team was overexaggerated . ''
4911 5052 While everyone was expecting great things from the Astros and the Braves , Hunsicker said , people were underrating the Padres ' pitching . ''
5053 5128 They have quality starters and the best closer in baseball , '' he said . ''
5129 5258 In low-scoring games , if your pitching is going to keep you in the game , then it 's just a matter of who rises to the occasion .
5259 5300 This season it happens to be Jim Leyritz .
5301 5353 Right now , Jim Leyritz is playing like Superman . ''
5354 5502 For Lack of a No. 1 Starter In the five years of their modern resurgence , the Cleveland Indians have never had a legitimate No. 1 starting pitcher .
5503 5637 That may very well be the reason they have not won the World Series and are not playing the World Series in Cleveland this weekend . ''
5638 5734 It always helps to have that big No. 1 , '' John Hart , the Indians ' general manager , said . ''
5735 5811 We readily admit we do n't have one of those dominant Cy Young marquee guys .
5812 5862 But we usually have five or six guys who are good .
5863 5914 Maybe they 're going to pitch anywhere from 2 to 4 .
5915 5959 We 've done it without a dominant No. 1 guy .
5960 6003 Does that keep you out of the World Series ?
6004 6008 No. .
6009 6042 Does it keep you from winning it ?
6043 6060 I do n't know . ''
6061 6278 In their four successive forays into post-season play , the Indians have started Dennis Martinez , Orel Hershiser , Charles Nagy , Ken Hill , Jack McDowell , Jaret Wright , Chad Ogea , Bartolo Colon and Dwight Gooden .
6279 6392 At times some of of those pitchers were considered No. 1 's , but they were past their prime with the Indians . ''
6393 6512 As we built our club , '' Hart said , '' we built it as an American League team -- small ball parks , lack of pitching .
6513 6555 We built our club early on around offense .
6556 6729 To win and still compete economically , we thought we would sign starting pitchers that would be able to keep us in games and hope to develop front-of-the-rotation starters .
6730 6805 Along the line , we tried to sign some guys , but that did n't work out . ''
6806 6935 The Indians pursued Roger Clemens , John Smoltz and Alex Fernandez as free agents and Pedro Martinez and Randy Johnson in trades .
6936 6994 They still await the arrival of a pitcher of that caliber .
6995 7131 The system they have built , Hart said , has carried the club to four consecutive division titles and three A.L. championship series . ''
7132 7248 It 's probably not the perfect world , but you kind of have to deal with what you have to work with , '' he said . ''
7249 7354 There 's not a bottomless pit where you can go out and say we 're going to have a star at every position .
7355 7513 Thaw in the Union The strong union feeling about players who served as replacement players in spring training of 1995 during the strike is apparently thawing .
7514 7624 The melting of bitter feelings can be seen in the post-season shares voted by players on high-finishing teams .
7625 7737 For the most part , based on a survey of club votes , players have treated replacement players like anyone else .
7738 7885 The Yankees , for example , voted Shane Spencer , the home run legend , half a full share based on the time he was with the team during the season .
7886 8099 Rick Reed of the Mets automatically received a full share because he was with the team all season , but Jeff Tam , a relief pitcher , was voted a share equal to the percentage of the season he spent with the Mets .
8100 8214 Boston players voted pitcher Ron Mahay a one-quarter share , as did the Chicago Cubs with infielder Jason Hardtke .
8215 8365 Catcher Mandy Romero will get a partial share based on service time from San Diego and a $ 3,000 cash award from Boston , where he was traded June 21 .
8366 8621 Among players who were not replacements , Randy Johnson , who pitched for Houston the last two months , was voted a full share , and Jim Leyritz will receive $ 10,000 from Boston 's post-season players ' pot and about 54 percent of a share from San Diego .
8622 8807 A player automatically receives a full share if he is with a team from June 1 , but the Yankees voted Orlando Hernandez a full share even though he missed that date by a couple of days .
8808 8886 Hideo Nomo missed by four days , and the Mets voted him a three-fourths share .
8887 9054 The Mets acquired Tony Phillips , Willie Blair and Jorge Fabregas on July 31 , but the players voted Phillips a three-quarters share and the other two about one-third .
9054 9054 .
