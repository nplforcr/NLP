0 93 ABC19981020 .1830.0205 NEWS STORY 10/20/1998 18:33:25.26 Now no American influence in Kosovo .
94 243 It is a week since the U.S. and NATO pressured the Serbian leader , Slobodan milosevic , to end the Serb violence against the ethnic Albanians there .
244 325 Today the Pentagon said we have not seen full compliance or anything close to it .
326 363 Sheila MacVicar is in Kosovo tonight .
364 472 Reporter : This is what the first American and European monitors are seeing as they drive throughout Kosovo .
473 595 Past miles of destroyed and empty villages , Serb police checkpoints where traffic is stopped and identity papers checked .
596 733 On hilltops , fortified Serb positions , and sometimes Serb armored vehicles -- Dozens of tanks and heavy weapons dug in and camouflaged .
734 788 These certainly look like violations of the agreement .
789 919 The problem is , the agreement itself is so short on specifics , western monitors can not say what is a violation and what is not .
920 996 I think that this is going to have to be worked out on a case-by-case basis .
997 1186 Reporter : With officials still trying to sort out just what the deal means , the bottom line is that the ethnic Albanian refugees are supposed to feel safe enough to go home and stay home .
1187 1220 But that is not happening either .
1221 1327 `` The Serb police are just up there , '' this man says , `` and they have a new checkpoint down there . ''
1328 1400 And for the last several nights , the Serbs have shelled these villages .
1401 1522 So while people have been coming home in the morning , every night people leave the village and go back to the mountains .
1523 1593 I was really disappointed to come back after the agreement was signed .
1594 1627 I expected to see an improvement .
1628 1774 Reporter : The agreement has done virtually nothing to change the Serb position , that they have the right to deploy their forces as they see fit .
