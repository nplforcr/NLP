99 225 Before the night was out , some republicans were practically anointing him as their presidential candidate two years from now .
226 266 ABC 's dean Reynolds reports from Texas .
267 297 inaudible Thank you , MA ` am .
298 443 Reporter : And bush has a network of well-healed contributors who helped to bankroll a media campaign as slick as most races for the White House .
444 515 His appeal to democrats , especially Hispanics is a big political plus .
516 656 speaking Spanish Reporter : While the governor opposes abortion and favors the death penalty and school prayer , he does n't sound strident .
657 740 I do n't think he 's the favorite of the evangelical right of the republican party .
741 794 But initially , he appears to be at least acceptable .
795 827 And that 's absolutely critical .

885 901 She helps a lot .
902 916 No , I do not .
917 936 Of course , you do .
937 1105 Reporter : He clearly loves campaigning , but he has said repeatedly that he is reluctant to put his family through what he calls the Washington political meat grinder .
1106 1231 And that has led to speculation that George W. bush lacks the requisite fire in the belly to make a race for the White House .
1232 1334 Then there are the questions about the governor 's admittedly irresponsible behavior as a young adult .
1335 1394 It all started because somebody discovered I quit drinking .
1395 1448 And somebody said , well , why did you quit drinking ?
1449 1494 And I said , because I was drinking too much .
1495 1601 Reporter : This being the '90s , bush has had to assure people that he 's been faithful to his wife Laura .
1602 1697 If there was something in my closet that would disqualify me from a run , you 'd know about it .
1698 1817 Reporter : He says he will concentrate on being governor for the next few months before deciding what to do about 2000 .
1818 1914 Whatever the decision , there 's no question a lot of people will be waiting to hear what it is .
