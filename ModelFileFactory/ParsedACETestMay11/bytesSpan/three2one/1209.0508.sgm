0 408 1209.0508 NEWS STORY SECTION : Section A ; Page 20 ; Column 5 ; National Desk LENGTH : 593 DATE : December 10 , 1998 HEADLINE : Oregon 's Gay Workers Given Benefits for Domestic Partners In the first ruling of its kind , an appeals court in Oregon ruled yesterday that the State Constitution gave homosexual government employees the right to health and life insurance benefits for their domestic partners . ''
409 678 This is , to my knowledge , the first time a court has said it 's unconstitutional not to give benefits to the domestic partners of gay and lesbian employees , '' said Matt Coles , director of the Lesbian and Gay Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union . ''
679 787 And there is no state in the country that provides domestic partner benefits to all government employees . ''
788 979 But Oregon does already provide benefits to the domestic partners of its employees : while the case was on appeal , the state voluntarily began offering such benefits to its direct employees .
980 1206 The employer of the three lesbian plaintiffs in the case , Oregon Health Sciences University , has also voluntarily begun offering such benefits , although it is no longer part of the state , but a separate public corporation .
1207 1466 While the ruling today involved only that university , Mr. Coles said , the decision would apply to every employee of a governmental entity in Oregon , expanding the benefits to thousands of teachers , police officers and others who work for local government .
1467 1567 Robert B. Rocklin , the assistant attorney general who argued the case , said he was not so sure . ''
1568 1699 I do n't know yet if we 'll appeal , and it 's hard to say exactly what the impact of the ruling would be , '' Mr. Rocklin said . ''
1700 1786 The court dismissed the state defendants because O.H.S.U. is no longer a state entity .
1787 1887 It 's not completely clear to me whether it would apply to all government employees in the state . ''
1888 2330 The ruling , by a three-judge panel of the State Court of Appeals , upheld a 1996 trial ruling in the case , finding that the denial of benefits to the three plaintiffs , all nursing professionals in long-term relationships who had applied for medical and dental insurance for their partners in 1991 , violated a section of the State Constitution similar to the Equal Protection clause of the 14th Amendment of the United States Constitution .
2331 2589 In a provision that is echoed in other states , the Oregon Constitution provides that '' no law shall be passed granting to any citizen or class of citizens privileges or immunities , which , upon the same terms , shall not equally belong to all citizens . ''
2590 2743 The three lesbian couples said they were members of a class of citizens , homosexual couples , that was being denied the privilege of insurance benefits .
2744 2949 The university argued that it was not discriminating against the class of homosexuals , since it denied insurance benefits to the unmarried partners of all employees , heterosexual and homosexual alike . ''
2950 3015 That reasoning misses the point , however , '' the court said . ''
3016 3049 Homosexual couples may not marry .
3050 3115 Accordingly , the benefits are not made available on equal terms .
3116 3215 They are made available on terms that , for gay and lesbian couples , are a legal impossibility . ''
3216 3343 In recent years , many private companies and local governments have voluntarily decided to offer benefits to domestic partners .
3344 3504 And New York and Vermont , like Oregon , provide benefits to domestic partners of their own workers , but not to those who work for local or county governments .
3505 3735 While the Oregon case is apparently the first in which courts have ordered such benefits , as a constitutional matter , several courts , in New Jersey and elsewhere , have rejected the kind of argument that prevailed in Oregon . ''
3736 3843 This is still a new area of law , and there 's a similar case pending in Pittsburgh , '' Mr. Coles said . ''
3844 3923 But when I look at this decision , I think what a difference a decade makes . ''
