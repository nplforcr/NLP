450 775 The report , based on a joint three-year study by groups in the four urban areas , concludes that these mass transit systems share many common attributes and problems , including highly centralized rail networks , growing business centers at their urban cores , huge populations of commuters and severe automobile congestion .
776 993 In some respects , mass transit in the New York region compares poorly , particularly in the paucity of service to much of its suburban ring , which forces suburban residents to rely on cars , according to the report .
994 1208 But for New Yorkers who hold to a commonly held view that the largest cities of Europe , particularly Paris and London , have model mass transit systems , the findings of the four-city study may come as a shock . ''
1209 1512 One thing it shows is that New York has made a good recovery in the last 30 years in the efficiency of its rail and subway systems , '' said Bill Shore , a senior associate with the Institute of Public Transportation , a New York City research group that carried out the New York component of the study .
1513 1718 For instance , the New York region 's commuter trains , including Metro-North , the Long Island Rail Road and New Jersey Transit , were found to be more punctual than those in the other metropolitan areas .
1719 1784 -LRB- New York 's subways , however , proved less punctual . -RRB-
1785 2036 All three New York regional commuter train systems were found to be punctual more than 90 percent of the time , while the regional rail network around London , long lauded as a model of efficiency , registered only 88 percent on the punctuality scale .
2037 2308 The report , released last week in the form of a thick compendium of charts , numerical rankings and other forms of comparative analysis , was the largest study comparing what are perhaps the world 's most advanced large cities in terms of mass transit , its authors say .
2309 2596 The other groups participating in the study were the London Research Centre , the Institut d'Amenagement et d'Urbanisme de la Region d'Ile-de-France of Paris and the Tokyo Institute for Municipal Research , all of which received government or philanthropic grants in their own countries .
2597 2859 While providing a broad portrait of the vast transportation systems in each metropolitan area and the challenges those regions face from urban sprawl , air pollution and other problems , the study provides many reminders of the differences in how people commute .
2860 2983 For instance , more than 500,000 people ride motorcycles into Tokyo each day , about 5 percent of its commuting population .
2984 3166 But the report found that only about 10,000 motorcyclists brave the New York region 's highways each day , so negligible a number that the report called it zero percent of the total .
3167 3333 According to the study 's authors , far more important conclusions reveal a combination of similarities in transit patterns and huge problems that must be confronted .
3334 3526 Among the comparative findings was that New York City subways trailed their foreign counterparts in punctuality , with 80 percent of the subways arriving close to their scheduled arrival time .
3527 3623 By that measure , Tokyo 's metro system came out on top , with 97 percent of its trains on time .
3624 3727 The report found a big difference among the four regions in the breadth of their mass transit networks .
3728 3891 While the New York City subway system has far more stations than its foreign counterparts , the report found that its suburban rail network had far fewer stations .
3892 4213 Mr. Shore said his group had concluded that the biggest challenge for the New York region , as revealed by the three-year study , was finding ways to lure more suburban residents onto trains and other forms of public transportation at a time when there is little hope that extensive new suburban rail lines will be built .
4214 4351 Near-term approaches to the problem , he said , may include providing better bus connections and more parking at suburban train stations .
4352 4486 But he said the vast scale of the problem was more likely to require changes in land-use planning and the rules governing development .
4487 4692 The objective , he said , should be to confine development to places already served by mass transit , instead of extending the limits of suburban sprawl farther from existing rail stations or bus lines . ''
4693 4823 The only solution appears to be in finding a way to better relate housing and jobs to existing public transportation , '' he said .
