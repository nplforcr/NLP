PRIAL dQC ; dLR ; dQL ; dUR ; c. 1998 N.Y. Times News Service dQC ; dLR ; dQL ; Brooks Brothers is getting into the wine business .
359 440 But please , hold the jokes about buttoned-down merlot and pinstriped chardonnay .
441 666 As many charge customers of the venerable haberdasher already know -LRB- a brochure went out recently with the monthly bills -RRB- , the new venture is called Brooks Brothers Cellar , and it is strictly a mail-order business .
667 780 So no , you wo n't be able to drop into your nearest Brooks Brothers store for a pair of socks and an '82 Latour .
781 902 It works like this : Send Brooks Brothers Cellar $ 30 a month , plus shipping , and it will send you two bottles of wine .
903 986 Subscriptions , if that 's the appropriate word , are for three , six or 12 months .
987 1043 The 180-year-old company is moving into wine cautiously .
1044 1225 The program is available in only three states , New York , New Jersey and Massachusetts , but there are plans to expand it to about 20 other states that permit selling wine by mail .
1226 1402 Brooks Brothers Cellar is the latest in a series of moves by the clothier to attract a newer , younger clientele and update its image while taking advantage of its famous name .
1403 1463 The company recently licensed its name to a line of eyewear .
1464 1588 `` Brooks Brothers is a slumbering giant , '' said Barbara Barry , a Los Angeles designer hired to polish the company image .
1589 1705 As Paul Gitter , the Brooks Brothers executive overseeing the wine program , put it : `` This is a life-style brand .
1706 1772 It has immense possibilities , and we plan to exploit them all . ''
1773 1810 Wine clubs like this one are not new .
1811 1957 Windsor Vineyards , a subsidiary of Rodney Strong Vineyards in Windsor , Calif. , in Sonoma County , has sold wine by mail for more than 30 years .
1958 2025 Windsor sells only its own wines , generally priced at $ 9 to $ 20 .
2026 2095 Its specialty is personalizing the labels for weddings and birthdays .
2096 2223 Mail-order wine is billed as a bargain but rarely is , if for no other reason than that the customer must pay shipping charges .
2224 2319 Money-saving claims are difficult to back up because many of the labels are obscure or unknown .
2320 2396 Knowledgeable customers can usually do just as well or better in wine shops .
2397 2442 Wine by mail rarely attracts savvy customers .
2443 2684 While some wine-club clients prefer mail-order wine because of the convenience or because they have no good wine shops nearby , others are attracted to it because they know little about wine and prefer having someone else select it for them .
2685 2827 Brooks Brothers Cellar subscribers can order two bottles of wine a month for a minimum of three months for a total of $ 90 , or $ 15 a bottle .
2828 2939 The shipping charge , $ 6.95 a month , will be waived for the first month for the store 's charge-card holders .
2940 3071 Members can select the color of their wines _ all red , all white or a mixed order of red and white _ but not the wines themselves .
3072 3115 No need for concern , Brooks Brothers says .
3116 3211 Its brochure assures that `` these are wines to remember ; full-bodied , crisp , or classic . ''
3212 3286 How does a clothing business come to address its customers in wine jargon ?
3287 3323 It hires someone else to do the job .
3324 3483 Brooks Brothers ' program is run by Geerlings dAMP ; Wade , a 20-year-old direct marketer of wine and wine-associated products in Canton , Mass. , near Boston .
3484 3634 Geerlings dAMP ; Wade sells directly to most of its customers , attracting them to its own wine club through brochures , catalogs and telephone sales .
3635 3707 It has also run programs like the one it has set up for Brooks Brothers .
3708 3897 `` We 've done them for Century 21 and the Brookstone chain , '' said Jay Essa , the president and chief executive , referring to the real estate company and the catalog and retail concern .
3898 3989 Geerlings dAMP ; Wade 's own customers can buy its wines only in six - and 12-bottle cases .
3990 4103 Prices range from as little as $ 7 a bottle to as much as $ 80 for a wide variety of domestic and imported wines .
4104 4310 The more expensive labels often bear familiar names like Joseph Phelps , the Napa Valley winery , and the Hospice de Beaune in Burgundy , but the lower-priced wines often have little-known or unknown names .
4311 4458 In fact , Geerlings dAMP ; Wade owns more than 20 names , which it uses on domestic wines it buys at low prices in the California bulk-wine market .
4459 4626 Its customers can be excused for being confused by names like Glass Ridge , J. Krant Cellars , Lapis Lazuli Winery and Vineyards , Rose Valley and St. Carolyne Winery .
4627 4721 These places do n't exist ; they are brand names Geerlings dAMP ; Wade can use as it sees fit .
4722 4848 Should Brooks Brothers Cellar members be more demanding , Geerlings dAMP ; Wade will almost certainly be ready to oblige them .
4849 5038 Its current catalog offers fine Bordeaux like Chateau Clerc Milon and California cabernets like Joseph Phelps ' Insignia at prices up to $ 840 a case , about what they cost in retail shops .
5039 5182 Brooks Brothers is entering wine by mail at a time when the business is under broad attack from part of the wine trade and from the government .
5183 5413 Wine sales are regulated by a bewildering array of laws that vary from state to state but generally require winemakers and importers to sell only to licensed distributors , who are then required to sell only to licensed retailers .
5414 5545 Direct-mail operators are accused of bypassing this three-tiered system and also of avoiding state taxes the distributors must pay .
5546 5688 Wine distributors are solidly opposed to any form of wine by mail and , under pressure from them , many states have been tightening the rules .
5689 5840 Geerlings dAMP ; Wade says it conforms to the system by holding retail licenses for warehouses in 14 states that are supplied by licensed distributors .
5841 5914 It collects taxes in all states where the law requires it to , Essa said .
5915 6009 `` We 're confident that we 're in compliance with the laws wherever we operate , '' he added .
6010 6107 But Brooks Brothers ' principal concern is , of course , customer response to an untried venture .
6108 6179 If it works , buttoned-down merlot may not be so far-fetched after all .
