0 454 1207.0405 NEWS STORY SECTION : Section A ; Page 1 ; Column 4 ; National Desk LENGTH : 880 DATE : December 8 , 1998 HEADLINE : Reno Rejects Outside Inquiry On Clinton for Campaign Ads WASHINGTON , Dec. 7 - Attorney General Janet Reno announced today that she had no reasonable grounds to seek the appointment of an independent counsel to investigate President Clinton 's role in a multimillion-dollar Democratic advertising campaign for the 1996 election .
455 558 Her decision swept away a lingering campaign finance issue that had haunted the White House for months .
559 872 On the final day of a 90-day review period provided under the independent counsel law , Ms. Reno concluded that no further criminal investigation of Mr. Clinton was warranted because there was '' clear and convincing evidence that the President and Vice President lacked the criminal intent to violate the law . ''
873 1010 The conclusion was based on Ms. Reno 's finding that their decisions had been guided by legal advice that the advertisements were lawful .
1011 1053 Excerpts from her court filing , page A24 .
1054 1147 Ms. Reno did not reach any judgment on the legality of the advertisements ' financing itself .
1148 1339 But she said the laws that regulated them were ambiguous , noting that members of the Federal Election Commission just last week described the standards as '' fuzzy '' and '' hardly clear . ''
1340 1533 The commission is expected to consider at meetings later this week whether 1996 advertising campaigns of both the Democratic and Republican Parties amounted to civil violations of election law .
1534 1732 The $ 46 million television campaign at issue in Ms. Reno 's decision today was financed by the Democratic National Committee and , under the law , was permitted to convey only broad party messages .
1733 1894 Instead , Federal election auditors have found , it communicated specific electioneering messages that directly benefited the Clinton-Gore re-election candidacy .
1895 2159 It was as a result of that finding , three months ago , that Ms. Reno set out to determine whether an independent prosecutor should investigate Mr. Clinton or his aides on the ground that they might have knowingly evaded the law in directing the advertising drive .
2160 2469 During the course of the subsequent inquiry , in which Mr. Clinton himself was interviewed by the Justice Department , the President 's lawyers argued that his reliance on legal advice insulated him from a charge of wrongdoing , since , they said , it showed that he had had no intention of violating the law .
2470 2583 Today , in her filing with the special Federal court that oversees independent-counsel matters , Ms. Reno agreed .
2584 2836 The Attorney General acknowledged in that filing that Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore had been intimately involved in the advertising campaign , raising money , formulating the advertising strategy , and reviewing and commenting on specific campaign messages .
2837 3021 But she found that their lawyers had also been deeply involved , so much so that '' media consultants periodically complained about the constraints the lawyers were placing on them . ''
3022 3119 At the White House , officials expressed their pleasure with the Attorney General 's judgment . ''
3120 3298 As we 've said all along , the President and the Clinton-Gore campaign complied with the spirit and letter of the law , '' said Joe Lockhart , the White House press secretary . ''
3299 3335 We are gratified by the decision . ''
3336 3661 At the same time , Ms. Reno disappointed Republicans , who had hoped that the '' issue ad '' investigation might finally force her to seek an independent prosecutor into campaign finance , an appointment they had sought for nearly two years through the course of inquiries into several aspects of fund-raising irregularities .
3662 3909 Of all those inquiries , this one was surely among the most significant , because an independent counsel would have focused directly on Mr. Clinton 's activities and cut to the core of the Democrats ' fund-raising operations for the 1996 election .
3910 4074 As they had before , Republicans complained today that Ms. Reno had compartmentalized the campaign finance investigations , effectively diluting any accusations . ''
4075 4357 Janet Reno has sliced this broad scandal into narrower issues so that common threads , patterns and facts are not considered when weighing each decision whether to seek an independent counsel , '' said Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah , the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee .
4358 4543 Senator Fred Thompson of Tennessee , chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee , which held extensive campaign finance hearings last year , found the outcome predictable . ''
4544 4647 Everyone knew this was coming , and it 's another banner day for the lawyers , '' Mr. Thompson said . ''
4648 4804 Lawyers advised the President that what he was doing was O.K. Lawyers at the Justice Department advised Reno that the independent counsel law did n't apply .
4805 5015 She relied on every lawyer around except the ones responsible for the investigation -- F.B.I. Director Louis J. Freeh and the head of the Justice Department 's campaign finance task force , Charles La Bella . ''
5016 5186 Mr. Thompson was referring to confidential memorandums by Mr. Freeh and Mr. La Bella urging Ms. Reno to seek appointment of an independent prosecutor on campaign finance .
5187 5365 Her move today followed by two weeks a decision by Ms. Reno in which she cleared away what might have been a serious obstacle on Vice President Al Gore 's path to the Presidency .
5366 5595 In that decision , Ms. Reno found on Nov. 24 that there was insufficient evidence for an outside prosecutor to look at whether Mr. Gore had lied to Justice Department investigators about his 1996 White House fund-raising efforts .
5596 5952 Taken together , these two decisions , plus one yet to come in a case involving Harold M. Ickes , former deputy White House chief of staff , amounted to what campaign finance lawyers said was probably the last chance for Ms. Reno to allow an outside prosecutor to examine the actions of senior White House officials in financing Mr. Clinton 's re-election .
