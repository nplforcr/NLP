354 500 From the early 1950 's to 1979 , artillery here ritually pounded the nearby islands of Jinmen , known in the West as Quemoy , and other locations .
501 764 On these same bluffs today stand giant red characters that repeat , for the benefit of nearby islanders who might gaze west with binoculars , China 's proposal for luring '' renegade '' Taiwan back into the fold : '' One Country , Two Systems to Reunify China . ''
765 1047 Across the water Taiwan , in response , has put up a huge white billboard calling for reunification according to the '' Three People 's Principles '' propounded early this century by the founder of the Republic of China , Sun Yat-sen : nationalism , democracy and better livelihood .
1048 1275 The dueling signs , erected last year , express the continuing test of wills between China and Taiwan -- a struggle that will enter a new phase on Wednesday with the first high-level contact in five years between the two sides .
1276 1534 Although Taiwan and China these days exchange symbolic gestures , even smiles , rather than artillery shots , the visit of a senior Taiwan official to Shanghai and Beijing is so sensitive that the two sides have not publicly agreed on what they will discuss .
1535 1609 Wary officials on Taiwan insist on calling this '' a visit , not talks . ''
1610 1673 They may agree on little more than to talk again in the future .
1674 1813 But because the stakes are so high , people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait , and in Washington , will be scrutinizing every inflection .
1814 1959 China sees recovering sovereignty over Taiwan as the unfinished business of the civil war that brought Communist victory on the mainland in 1949 .
1960 2042 China ceaselessly calls the recovery of Taiwan its overriding foreign policy goal .
2043 2175 Taiwan , which has created prosperity and democracy , no longer claims , as it once did , to house the true government of all China .
2176 2252 More and more , its 22 million people say they feel an independent identity .
2253 2432 Taiwan 's leaders , mindful of the glowering colossus nearby , still profess to want reunification -- some day far in the future , when China , too , is prosperous and democratic .
2433 2521 For now they insist that China and the world must recognize Taiwan as a separate entity .
2522 2652 In a typical speech on Saturday , the President of Taiwan , Lee Teng-hui , called for a '' gradualist approach '' toward unity . ''
2653 2889 We are looking forward to constructive dialogue between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait based on the reality of divided rule , '' he said , promising continued efforts to break free of the diplomatic strangulation pursued by Beijing .
2890 2999 Visiting China from Oct. 14 to 19 will be Koo Chen-fu , head of the semiofficial Straits Exchange Foundation .
3000 3127 He is to meet with his Chinese counterpart , Wang Daohan , head of China 's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait .
3128 3253 In what is seen as a good-will gesture by Beijing , Mr. Koo is also to meet the Chinese President , Jiang Zemin , on Oct. 18 .
3254 3341 Mr. Koo and Mr. Wang held their first , and only , official talks in Singapore in 1993 .
3342 3562 Their next scheduled meeting , in 1995 , was canceled by China when it was angered by President Lee 's visit to a class reunion at Cornell University , seen as a perfidious effort to bolster Taiwan 's independent status .
3563 3758 The next year , relations became more tense when China conducted missile tests near Taiwan during the island 's presidential election and the United States sent aircraft carriers into the region .
3759 3878 Since then the United States , worried about being dragged into a conflict , has encouraged both sides to resume talks .
3879 4014 Despite their diverging goals , both sides may feel that their interests are served by meeting , said a Western diplomat in Beijing . ''
4015 4168 For Taiwan , if China is talking it 's not attacking , and for China , if Taiwan is talking then it 's not declaring independence , '' the diplomat said .
4169 4373 China has called for immediate discussions of the political future , offering a deal looser than Hong Kong 's in which Taiwan could keep its democracy and even its army but come under Chinese sovereignty .
4374 4505 Taiwan wants to fend off political negotiations , limiting talks for now to practical issues like fishing and immigration disputes .
4506 4667 Complicating the matter , China and Taiwan are increasingly intertwined economically and socially , a process China encourages and Taiwan is struggling to limit .
4668 4839 The ties are apparent here in Xiamen , one of China 's thriving '' special economic zones '' that is host to many Taiwan factories , real estate developments and tourists .
4840 5040 In the last few days , among hundreds of visiting '' compatriots , '' as they are always called here , were 24 members of a Taipei golf club who came to play Xiamen 's three golf courses and sightsee .
5041 5232 Also visiting , at the invitation of the Elders ' Society of Xiamen , were 21 men and women from a Taiwan senior citizens ' group , who are performing folk songs and dances in several cities .
5233 5376 More than a million business executives and tourists from Taiwan visit China each year , and some 50,000 live here , the Western diplomat said .
5377 5441 In contrast , Taiwan strictly limits visitors from the mainland .
5442 5595 Taiwan 's investment and trade in the mainland are large and climbing , even as its Government tries to enforce its slogan of '' Go slow ; be patient . ''
5596 5799 The Taiwan Government has refused to allow large , showcase investments like multibillion-dollar petrochemical and power projects in Fujian Province that were planned by the giant Formosa Plastics Group .
5800 5954 Many Taiwan businesses are chafing at the policy , and the Formosa Group 's chairman , Wang Yung-ching , has publicly urged his Government to relax it . ''
5955 6033 We fear we will lose our opportunity '' in China , he said in a recent speech .
6034 6146 Most important , Taiwan does not allow direct transportation , postal or communications links with the mainland .
6147 6287 This slows cross-strait business by adding costs and forces travelers to spend hundreds of extra dollars looping through Hong Kong or Macao .
6288 6500 Capt. Yao Ming-fu of the Taiwan-owned ship Uni-Pioneer , in Xiamen harbor this weekend to pick up cargo that will eventually go to Japan or Southeast Asia , expressed the frustrations of shippers and businessmen .
6501 6589 Taking goods directly from here to Taiwan 's main harbor takes about 12 hours , he said .
6590 6694 But his ship can only carry Chinese-made goods for reshipment onward ; none can be imported into Taiwan .
6695 6869 Transporting Chinese goods to Taiwan itself requires a 24-hour boat trip to Hong Kong , some bothersome paperwork , then another 14-hour journey to Taiwan , said Captain Yao .
6870 6953 His parent company , the Evergreen Group , is one of the world 's largest shippers .
6954 7195 Taiwan officials have not been able to contain small-scale direct commerce in both directions among islands around Xiamen , and people from Taiwan even make one - to five-day visits across these waters , say local press reports and scholars .
7196 7273 How long this strange dance between China and Taiwan can continue is unknown .
7274 7397 China has warned that if Taiwan formally declares independence , it will mount a military attack -- a regional catastrophe .
7398 7483 Short of such a declaration , what action by Taiwan might touch off a harsh response ?
7484 7521 How long will China 's patience hold ?
7522 7685 Major agreement in the next three to five years seems unlikely , Fan Xihou , director of the Taiwan Research Institute of Xiamen University , said in an interview .
7686 7802 But after that , he suggested , '' time will be against Taiwan '' as China 's military and economic strength builds .
7803 7974 Taiwan , for its part , hopes that it can continue mustering enough strength at home and abroad to shape the terms of its future relationship with the would-be motherland .
