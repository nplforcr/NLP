Times News Service dLR ; dQC ; dQL ; LOS ANGELES _ On Saturday night , the Glass House dance club in nearby Pomona was packed with 800 people enjoying the holidays when the local police , federal agents and members of a Los Angeles County hazardous materials team walked in and stopped the music .
664 743 It was almost midnight and for the next four hours no one was allowed to leave .
744 969 A few minutes earlier someone had called 911 and reported what has suddenly become a common threat across the Los Angeles area in the holiday season : The caller said the lethal bacteria anthrax had been released in the club .
970 1097 But like the other half-dozen anthrax threats made this month by mail and telephone , the report at the Glass House was a hoax .
1098 1192 `` It just seems to be the wacko 's flavor of the month , '' said FBI spokesman Frank Scafidi .
1193 1238 `` It used to be you called in a bomb threat .
1239 1262 Everybody gets freaked .
1263 1291 You shut down the operation .
1292 1314 The perp got his kick .
1315 1348 This is just the 1998 version . ''
1349 1535 In the last month , nearly 3,000 people were evacuated and detained for hours after anthrax threats were received at courthouses , schools , stores and , most recently , the Glass House .
1536 1629 Colorado , Kentucky and Tennessee have also been subject to anthrax threats in recent months .
1630 1807 Now , Los Angeles authorities are reassessing how they handle such calls , searching for the best balance between protecting the public and not wasting time and money on hoaxes .
1808 1938 There is talk of scaling back the response the next time someone calls in and mumbles he or she has released anthrax into the air .
1939 2032 They are quick to add that each situation will have to be evaluated and treated individually .
2033 2217 `` We 're trying to fine-tune our response , '' said Dr. Laurene Mascola , chief of the acute communicable disease control unit of the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services .
2218 2270 `` We 're trying to treat it like any other hoax . ''
2271 2463 Mascola said the authorities may stop their practice of detaining people for hours while they search a threatened building and instead send people home if there is no clear evidence of danger .
2464 2641 At the night club , the authorities took the names and telephone numbers of all the patrons and then handed out pamphlets on anthrax and the proper way to decontaminate at home .
2642 2758 `` That adds to people 's anxieties and it 's positive feedback for the people who are doing the hoax , '' she said .
2759 2845 Anthrax is not easy to spread or catch and it is not contagious from person to person .
2846 2947 If it were released there would be plenty of time to administer medical treatment to anyone infected .
2948 3117 Mascola said she and her staff have had to spend considerable time answering questions about anthrax instead of concentrating on less sensational and every day problems .
3118 3149 `` Can I sleep with my wife ? ''
3150 3187 a man asked her after being detained .
3188 3220 `` Can I give it to my horse ? ''
3221 3240 someone else asked .
3241 3370 Still , finding the right balance between shrugging off a prank caller and responding to a possible emergency is not always easy .
3371 3509 `` You ca n't afford to ignore one , '' said Robert Blitzer , who recently left the FBI after directing its section on domestic terrorism .
3510 3617 `` You must attend to each and every one of them even though you know that most will turn out to be hoaxes .
3618 3708 Because the one time you do n't , it might be wrong , and there 's no margin for error . ''
3709 3863 So far , the authorities say they believe that the Los Angeles area threats are not related and appear to be the work of a litter of individual copy cats .
3864 4069 Steve Ruda , a hazardous waste expert with the Los Angeles City Fire Department , speculated that anthrax may have been chosen for the hoaxes because talk of chemical warfare has been in the news recently .
4070 4162 The first threat came in a letter to a woman , apparently in a domestic dispute , Ruda said .
4163 4376 `` For thirty five cents , the price of a phone call , they 're tying up all this manpower , '' said a disgusted Jim Nishida , a supervisor in the Los Angeles County Fire Department 's hazardous material division .
4377 4420 `` We ca n't be doing this continuously . ''
4421 4446 -LRB- STORY CAN END HERE .
4447 4595 OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS -RRB- About 2:30 p.m. Dec. 18 , a call was received at the clerk 's office in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Woodland Hills .
4596 4712 The caller said `` there may be anthrax in our air conditioning system '' recalled Dolores Molina , a court manager .
4713 4929 The call was transferred to the U.S. Marshal 's Service , which decided to evacuate the 90 people in the building , including court staff , janitorial workers , probation department workers and members of the public .
4930 5016 They proceeded calmly to a parking lot , which was roped off with yellow caution tape .
5017 5153 No one was allowed to leave until about 10:30 p.m. , she said , while a hazardous materials team took sample of the air in the building .
5154 5288 As the team worked inside , Ms. Molina and her co-workers were given blankets , pizza and donuts and a portable toilet was brought in .
5289 5444 The week before , an old-fashioned bomb threat was phoned in and Ms. Molina said the workers viewed the anthrax incident as more of a hassle than a threat .
5445 5550 `` Some of the employees , '' she said , `` were saying they were disgusted they had to go through it . ''
5551 5712 Three days later , nearly 2,000 people were evacuated from the Superior and Municipal Court buildings in Van Nuys after someone called 911 shortly after 11 a.m. .
5713 5876 They were detained until about 4 p.m. `` You have to always treat a threat as real , '' said Mark Whaling , a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Fire Department .
5877 5952 `` Monday morning quarterbacking will eat us alive if we make a mistake . ''
