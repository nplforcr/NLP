615 842 `` The survivors are ready to work toward a solution _ but they will not be shut out and the German government can not stop their claims , '' the group said in a statement faxed from their lawyer 's office in the United States .
843 1053 Before taking office last month , Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder 's government said a group comprising government and industry will work out a plan to settle back-wage claims from World War II-era slave laborers .

1289 1391 The plan is an attempt to `` bargain away our claims , '' survivor Paul Frenkel said in the statement .
1392 1518 He did not elaborate on how that was being done , and the German government has not announced any specifics on a payment plan .
1519 1772 An alternative group comprising class action claimants , slave labor survivors , the Jewish Claims Conference , German industry and banks and the German government should meet and agree on a settlement , group lawyer Michael Witti said in the statement .
