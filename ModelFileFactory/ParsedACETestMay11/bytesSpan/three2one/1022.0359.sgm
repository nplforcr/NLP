208 481 In the rehearsal hall , the dialogue was sliced tart and true from the life and times of Monica S. Lewinsky , with no less than three actresses taking a crack at the ultimate ingenue 's role in the inescapable national melodrama that has no copyright , perchance no ending .
482 835 The actors as much as the audience seemed mesmerized by the hourlong experiment at the New Dramatists playhouse , a scene of grand jury inquisition about sex and love , pride and President and all the attendant folderol that , inevitably , has raised the question of whether this stuff of life can offer something more meaningful through the theater . ''
836 1046 I 'm an insecure person , '' declared the first Monica , Culver Casson , reading the line of grand jury dialogue most sadly in explaining why she seemed so often to be there on those Presidential rope lines . ''
1047 1090 I would go early and stand in the front . ''
1091 1190 The second Monica , Emme Shaw , played it far less for pity than with a kind of savvy innocence . ''
1191 1222 Can you guys call me Monica ? ''
1223 1324 she suddenly asked the grand jury amid all the testimony about gifts and stains and embarrassment . ''
1325 1338 I 'm just 25 .
1339 1349 Please . ''
1350 1615 And the third Monica , Abigail Rose Revasch , a study in wide-eyed , free-fall anxiety , provided a confessional rush in telling of haphazardly falling in love with , well , the President of the United States : '' I thought , I thought : he had a beautiful soul . ''
1616 1657 Her spotlighted Monica was all at sea . ''
1658 1717 I do n't know what the truth is anymore , '' she keened . ''
1718 1898 I do n't know if it 's based on him being an actor , '' she said of the President , threatening the rehearsal hall , on West 44th Street in Manhattan , with a play within the play .
1899 2072 The strong applause and vigorous audience discussion that followed the reading by the band of 10 actors on Wednesday night marked the evening as something more than a stunt .
2073 2285 It seemed closer to '' a response to this public distress that we 're in , '' as Todd London , the artistic director , put it in his welcome to New Dramatists , which has been developing playwrights for 50 years .
2286 2412 The evening at least suggested that no plot line is too far-fetched , nor has the nation ever been more provoked to catharsis .
2413 2605 With her grand jury chorus compulsively curious but finally empathetic , the young woman chattily described a flirtation suddenly exploding into a huge criminal investigation of the President .
2606 2801 No less did the performance feature ludicrous moments , the audience guffawing at the true-from-life notion of the President on crutches being lewdly , hurriedly serviced by the office intern . ''
2802 2841 Oh my God , this is so embarrassing ! ''
2842 2932 said Ms. Lewinsky as a helpful grand juror gently coached , '' You can close your eyes . ''
2933 3195 Since the sound of Ms. Lewinsky has not actually been heard in public despite all the months of Washington scandal-traipsing , Mr. London rotated three Monicas through the dialogue as a sample of the possibilities , and he reduced the grand jury to five members .
3196 3445 The transition from the enacted scene to the discussion among the 75 people in the hall seemed well cued by one compassionate grand juror 's troubled line to Ms. Lewinsky : '' I ca n't figure out why you keep going after things that are n't free . ''
3446 3600 Or , as the problem was analyzed by Moira Driscoll , a grand jury actress finally speaking for herself : '' She did n't think through the thong moment . ''
3601 3761 Far more than that famously impulsive display of undergarment , Ms. Lewinsky did n't think many things through , the gathering agreed , always wondering why . ''
3762 3870 She definitely wanted to be forgiven and to be loved , '' said Kate Robin , a playwright in the audience . ''
3871 3884 And she wins !
3885 3915 The grand jurors loved her . ''
3916 3994 They offered her a bouquet at the end , '' she noted of their parting gift . ''
3995 4031 It was because she was so honest . ''
4032 4097 Instantly , another playwright , Barry Jay Kaplan , disagreed . ''
4098 4127 No , no , no , '' he said . ''
4128 4207 It 's because she has spent a lifetime learning how to do that , how to please .
4208 4236 She 's really good at it . ''
4237 4421 The now familiar Lewinsky Effect swept the audience , the inability by all sorts of well-resolved Americans not to discuss the tale even as they pronounce it too pathetic for words . ''
4422 4440 What about him ? ''
4441 4550 came one writer 's question about the President , somewhere far offstage amid Ms. Lewinsky 's predicament . ''
4551 4682 He 's not in this scene , '' another professional dismissively replied , savoring some of the good lines Ms. Lewinsky gave herself .
4683 4731 -LRB- '' Inherent in a secret is a lie . '' -RRB-
4732 4915 The evening 's director , Sabrina Peck , a specialist in verbatim dialogue drama on topics like the Bosnian refugee tragedy , admitted to doubts about the Lewinsky tale 's gravity . ''
4916 5138 We 're all disgusted on one level by the whole thing , but maybe there 's some usefulness , '' she said , finally delighted by the strong audience reaction and teased by the advice to '' make the second act Linda Tripp . ''
5139 5183 Comic relief continued to the closing lines .
5184 5317 The audience laughed at the 12-step parody in a grand juror 's avuncular advice , '' Monica , none of us in this room are perfect . ''
5318 5453 By then the third Monica of the night was weeping in farewell as she was asked if she had anything at all to add to her performance . ''
5454 5537 I 'm sorry , I 'm really sorry for everything that 's happened , '' she apologized .
5538 5610 Then , interrupting her sobs , she added , '' And I hate Linda Tripp ! ''
5611 5739 Most mercifully , the audience 's closing burst of laughter suggested the whole thing may prove more of a comedy than a tragedy .
5739 5739 .
