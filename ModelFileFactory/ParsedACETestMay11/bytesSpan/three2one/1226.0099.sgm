397 633 Florence Adamson -- '' not Flo , or Flossie , it 's been Florence all my life , '' she says with determined dignity -- was born Jan. 4 , 1895 , into a world without movies , airplanes , income taxes , the World Series and Mother 's Day .
634 718 She was 50 when television emerged and 80 when the first personal computer was sold .
719 976 Yet all the progress during her 103 years , all the epic events , seem to amount to so much historical bric-a-brac when Mrs. Adamson reflects on her life , sitting in her mahogany and floral-print room in The Osborn , a top-drawer home for the elderly here .
977 1132 Nothing mattered more than the family she grew up with , on Manhattan 's East 21st Street , and the family she raised in two affluent Westchester towns . ''
1133 1287 It was a very sedate world , '' she said , sitting in an armchair surrounded by family photographs , a walker nearby on which her prim handbag dangled . ''
1288 1330 It was our home life that was a big thing .
1331 1409 My mother was a professional singer and I took piano lessons to accompany her .
1410 1438 We had an Edison gramophone .
1439 1457 We loved music . ''
1458 1535 I can remember going to Stuyvesant Park with a roller hoop and roller skates .
1536 1588 Mother took my brothers and me every good afternoon .
1589 1606 We were outdoors .
1607 1632 The park was not crowded .
1633 1654 It was delightful . ''
1655 1905 Mrs. Adamson , whose cheerful , under-five-foot presence is strengthened by soft blue eyes and spun-silver hair , raised three daughters who gave her grandchildren , great-grandchildren , and great-great-grandchildren in numbers she can not count . ''
1906 1949 It 's hard to keep track , '' she jokes . ''
1950 1991 I 'm lucky I can keep track of myself . ''
1992 2045 The Depression forced her to move to a smaller house .
2046 2088 The two world wars caused some turbulence .
2089 2231 But most great events had the quality of distant storms , sometimes scaring her , mostly sparing her , but nothing she could do much about . ''
2232 2319 The world just took care of itself , and I had my family to take care of , '' she said .
2320 2377 The person in the 20th century who most impressed her ? ''
2378 2455 It might have been the organist in the church I belonged to , '' she said . ''
2456 2555 He was a fine person , nicely educated , treated us well , and taught us music and nice manners . ''
2556 2569 The organist ?
2570 2644 What about Franklin Roosevelt , Winston Churchill , Martin Luther King ? ''
2645 2699 I just let them take care of themselves , '' she says .
2700 2822 Getting such answers from a 100-year-old person reminds one of those interviews with Mel Brooks as the 2,000-year-old man .
2823 2887 The greatest invention , the old man concluded , was Saran Wrap .
2888 2908 The greatest writer ?
2909 2935 It was n't Shakespeare . ''
2936 3039 With an L that looked like a T , an M that looked like an N. He had the worst penmanship I ever saw . ''
3040 3322 The very old , particularly if they have led comfortable lives , have the luxury of forgetting that in the 20th century women got to vote and compete in the workplace , blacks gained access to schools and jobs , medicine made it possible for people like Mrs. Adamson to live to 100 .
3323 3426 -LRB- Her secret for health is not the 2,000-year-old man 's nectarine but a sherry now and then . -RRB-
3427 3545 But her take on the century is that emotional connections matter more than all the hoopla historians pay attention to .
3546 3665 Nothing gave her more happiness than marriage to Seth Adamson and nothing devastated her as much as his death at 62 . ''
3666 3717 He was playing golf on the Sunday , '' she said . ''
3718 3747 Monday he has a heart attack .
3748 3772 Sunday he 's dead . '' ''
3773 3821 I have an old-fashioned theory , '' she said . ''
3822 3911 Any woman that is loved very much by the right man has the world right at her fingertips .
3912 3938 It makes for a happy home .
3939 3970 It makes for happy children . ''
3971 3998 Mrs. Adamson is no Luddite .
3999 4112 She appreciates the telephone that brings calls from her progeny , the television that brings her '' Jeopardy . ''
4113 4279 But she also seems to believe that many of our conveniences , much of our consuming need for news and entertainment , are distractions from life 's bedrock pleasures .
4280 4352 In her life , it was civility and companionship that proved enduring . ''
4353 4471 No matter what the year is , no matter what the season , if you have that , you 've got the whole works , '' she said .
4471 4471 .
