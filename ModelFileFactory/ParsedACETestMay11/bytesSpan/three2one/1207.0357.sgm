194 320 But this country may spend the first months of 1999 -- as many as six months -- with the President on trial before the Senate .
321 415 For six days a week , under the rules , the 100 senators would be in their seats on the floor .
416 462 Chief Justice William Rehnquist would preside .
463 538 Congress , the President and the Supreme Court would be seriously disabled .
539 659 That is where the right-wing Republicans who are effectively running the impeachment process in the House are taking us .
660 699 Most Americans do not want to go there .
700 754 Indeed , they assume that impeachment is a dead issue .
755 813 But the House may vote next week to impeach the President .
814 830 How can that be ?
831 959 Henry Hyde , who as chairman of the Judiciary Committee is the formal manager of the process , is widely respected in the House .
960 1026 Moreover , he has a strong feeling for our political institutions .
1027 1140 Yet he is driving toward an impeachment that would damage the Presidency and arouse public contempt for Congress .
1141 1145 Why ?
1146 1259 Some who know Henry Hyde well say that , on partisan issues , he does not like to stray from the Republican line .
1260 1325 And the line on impeachment is being set by the Republican right .
1326 1470 With Speaker-to-be Robert Livingston silent , the commanding voice is that of Tom DeLay of Texas , the majority whip , a hard-line conservative .
1471 1640 Other forceful figures are Bill McCollum of Florida and Bob Barr of Georgia , who has been demanding President Clinton 's impeachment on one ground or another for years .
1641 1701 Many conservatives have a visceral dislike for Bill Clinton .
1702 1828 They reason that , even if he was acquitted in the Senate , impeachment would mark him as not even President Nixon was marked .
1829 1977 Mr. McCollum said the other day that impeachment would satisfy those who '' believe the President should be branded and given the scarlet letter . ''
1978 2072 The right is affirmatively opposed to what many people favor : censure instead of impeachment .
2073 2199 It would rather lose on impeachment and then use the negative votes of moderate Republicans to try to purge them in primaries .
2200 2261 Republican moderates are under heavy pressure from the right .
2262 2452 When Representative Billy Tauzin of Louisiana let it be known that he might consider censure rather than impeachment , the far-right magazine Human Events denounced him as '' pro-perjury . ''
2453 2487 His office got thousands of calls .
2488 2647 The moderates are also said to have been put off by what Mr. DeLay called '' lawyerese '' in Mr. Clinton 's reply to 81 questions from the Judiciary Committee .
2648 2815 Anyone facing a prosecutor who wants to put him in prison -- as Kenneth Starr plainly does the President -- will be advised by his lawyer to say as little as possible .
2816 2880 Even so , Mr. Clinton could no doubt have been more forthcoming .
2881 3001 But what should be in the minds of the Republican moderates -- and for that matter conservative Democrats -- is history .
3002 3148 Specifically , the two notorious impeachments in our history : of Supreme Court Justice Samuel Chase in 1804 and President Andrew Johnson in 1868 .
3149 3257 Chief Justice Rehnquist published a book in 1992 on those two impeachments and trials , '' Grand Inquest . ''
3258 3297 Both , he said , were highly political .
3298 3400 President Jefferson and his supporters went for Justice Chase because they did not like his judgments .
3401 3550 President Johnson was attacked by the Radical Republicans of his day because he wanted to temper harsh policies toward the South after the Civil War .
3551 3710 If either had been convicted , Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote , '' a long shadow would have been cast '' over the independence of the courts and the Presidency .
3711 3780 But enough Jeffersonians in the Senate voted to acquit Justice Chase .
3781 3895 And President Johnson was acquitted by a single vote -- that of a Republican Senator from Kansas , Edmund G. Ross .
3896 3961 Senator Ross was ostracized and impoverished because of his vote .
3962 4133 But John F. Kennedy listed him in '' Profiles in Courage , '' saying his '' heroic '' act '' may well have preserved ... constitutional government in the United States . ''
4134 4257 The accusers of Bill Clinton have abandoned all the potentially serious charges : Whitewater , campaign finance , Filegate .
4258 4321 What remains , however ingeniously framed , is lying about sex .
4322 4440 To impeach him for that would trivialize a grave constitutional process and cast a lingering shadow on the Presidency .
4440 4440 .
