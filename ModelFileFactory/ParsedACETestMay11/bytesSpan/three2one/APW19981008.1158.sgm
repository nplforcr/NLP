United coach Bruce Arena is the leading candidate for the U.S. national team job and likely will be offered the position after the Major League Soccer championship game , U.S. federation secretary general Hank Steinbrecher said Thursday .
646 745 `` We will not do anything during MLS , '' Steinbrecher said from the USSF 's Chicago headquarters .

969 1018 I expect an offer will come at the end of MLS . ''
1019 1185 The MLS Cup is scheduled for Oct. 25 in the Rose Bowl in Pasadena , California , but the United States has friendly against Australia Nov. 6 in San Jose , California .
1186 1274 Steinbrecher said he was n't sure who would coach the U.S. team for the Australia match .
1275 1320 `` We do n't know yet , '' Steinbrecher said .
1321 1389 `` If Bruce takes the job , we believe everything can be worked out .

1459 1611 Arena repeatedly has refused to comment on media reports and did so again Thursday , issuing a statement through the club 's media relations department .
1612 1729 `` At the current time I do not wish to make any comments concerning any speculation about my future , '' Arena said .

1851 1939 I would appreciate if the entire subject could be dropped until the appropriate time . ''
1940 2125 D.C. United finished off the Miami Fusion on Sunday in their first-round playoff series and begins its best-of-3 Eastern Conference semifinal series against the Columbus Crew on Sunday .
2126 2268 Arena and Queiroz , the former Portuguese national team and current United Arab Emirates coach , were the leading candidates for the U.S. job .

2537 2775 `` In general , we had conversations about philosophy , what the job is , what direction the national teams and the federation are going in , '' said Steinbrecher , who said he would prefer a long-term contract through the next World Cup .

2968 3212 The Interamerican Cup pits the CONCACAF club champion , D.C. United , against the South American Copa Libertadores champion , Brazil 's Vasco da Gama , and a victory would be a major credibility boost for both United and the three-year-old MLS .

3444 3486 `` This is the day the MLS needs to shine .
