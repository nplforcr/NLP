688 884 Richard Holbrooke 's mission to Brussels , Belgium , came with Western nations evacuating diplomats from Yugoslavia _ adding to a sense that a last-minute deal was necessary to avoid intervention .
885 1106 Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev told journalists in Moscow that the Yugoslav president had agreed to allow 1,500 international observers to monitor compliance with U.N. demands to halt the Serb crackdown in Kosovo .
1107 1273 If true , that would represent a key last-minute concession by Milosevic that came only hours before NATO planned to authorize the attack against Milosevic 's forces .
1274 1346 There was no immediate confirmation of Milosevic 's reported concession .
1347 1444 But a statement from Milosevic 's office said Holbrooke would return and hold more talks Tuesday .
1445 1646 It said Milosevic `` has concluded that undoubtedly , necessary conditions exist for a peaceful political solution to the Kosovo problem '' _ a position that Western officials previously have disputed .
1647 1851 In the Kosovo capital Pristina , a senior ethnic Albanian leader said that if Milosevic agrees to such a force , it `` could prove useful and provide a way out of the Kosovo crisis without further war . ''
1852 2106 `` If Milosevic really accepts an international monitoring force , it would create a position of equilibrium in which the two sides can then negotiate , '' said Fehmi Agani , head of the ethnic Albanian team set up to negotiate with Belgrade authorities .
2107 2295 Milosevic launched his crackdown Feb. 28 to crush the Kosovo Liberation Army , fighting for independence for the majority Albanian province , which is part of Serbia , a Yugoslav republic .
2296 2381 The confluct has killed hundreds of driven more than 270,000 people from their homes .
2382 2571 In Kosovo , the ethnic Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center said two ethnic Albanians were wounded Monday when `` newly-arrived Serb forces shot at a village '' in central Drenica region .
2572 2806 The center also reported shooting near Malisevo , 40 kilometers -LRB- 25 miles -RRB- southwest of Pristina , and army troops deployment of 40 vehicles near Podujevo , 25 kilometers -LRB- 16 miles -RRB- north of the provincial capital .
2807 2873 Serb sources claimed there were no clashes Monday in the province .
2874 2927 None of the reports could be independently confirmed .
2928 3036 Ethnic Albanians represent 90 percent of Kosovo 's 2 million people and most want independence or self-rule .
3037 3190 Holbrooke arrived in Brussels as NATO ambassadors were meeting to approve an activation order _ the last formal step before airstrikes could be launched .
3191 3463 A NATO official who spoke on condition of anonymity said an activation order would show NATO 's resolve to end the violence in Kosovo , where hundreds of people have been killed and tens of thousands uprooted since Feb. 28 crackdown against ethnic Albanian rebels started .
3464 3659 The order would transfer the command over the airplanes and military equipment necessary for an airstrike to Supreme Allied Commander Wesley K. Clark and authorize its deployment over Yugoslavia .
3660 3805 Clark could then proceed in consultation with NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana all the way to actually ordering planes and missiles launched .
3806 4039 Sergeyev said Russia , which as Yugoslavia 's ally has tried to broker a deal that would avoid NATO intervention , was prepared to provide planes for controlling Yugoslav airspace , and consider participating in the monitoring force .
4040 4188 Earlier Monday , United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan phoned Milosevic to urge him to comply with U.N. resolutions to end the Kosovo turmoil .
4189 4364 Milosevic responded that he was `` in the process of complying , or trying to come into full compliance with the Security Council resolutions , '' spokesman Fred Eckhard said .
4365 4477 Holbrooke 's mission to Brussels followed a flurry of diplomatic evacuations by Western nations from Yugoslavia .
4478 4572 That added to a sense that intervention was imminent _ barring a breakthrough in negotiations .
4573 4717 The international diplomats ' mission observing events evacuated Kosovo for neighboring Macedonia , with the Russian members the last to depart .
4718 4910 Sources at the American Embassy in Belgrade said all but 12 foreign staff were being evacuated to Budapest , and an embassy statement said personnel in `` non-emergency situations '' had left .
4911 5065 A State Department advisory urged all U.S. citizens to leave Yugoslavia , and Americans in the Serb part of neighboring Bosnia also were advised to leave .
5066 5143 The German , British , Danish and other foreign embassies closed down Monday .
5144 5360 Holbrooke , who has met with Milosevic seven times in the past eight days for a total of roughly 50 hours , described his earlier overnight meeting with Milosevic as `` intense , indeed , and at times very heated . ''
5361 5460 He said the standoff between NATO and the Yugoslav president `` can only be called an emergency . ''
5461 5646 Italy on Monday authorized the use of its military bases for any NATO raid , while the outgoing German government said it intends to allow German warplanes to participate in any attack .
5647 5808 In Paris , French Defense Minister Alain Richard said his country would provide around 40 aircraft for possible airstrikes , which could last `` several days . ''
5809 5996 The major obstacle appeared to be Holbrooke 's request that Milosevic agree to an expanded international monitoring mission to verify compliance with demands of the U.N. Security Council .
5997 6224 The Security Council demands include an immediate cease-fire , a withdrawal of special troops in the province , allowing refugees to return home and beginning talks with independence-minded ethnic Albanians on Kosovo 's future .
6225 6302 The Pentagon was making military preparations if Holbrooke 's mission failed .
6303 6422 Six U.S. B-52 bombers arrived in Britain on Sunday and a contingent of A-10 antitank planes flew from Germany to Italy .
6423 6624 The positioning of more U.S. planes within range of Yugoslavia and preparing them for attacks were clearly designed to convince Milosevic of Washington 's resolve to force compliance with U.N. demands .
