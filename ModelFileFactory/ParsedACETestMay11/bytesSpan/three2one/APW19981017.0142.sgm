546 674 His shaky health has become a national obsession and keeps him away from the Kremlin for days , and sometimes weeks , at a time .
675 829 The economy is suffering through its worst breakdown in the post-Soviet era , but he rarely raises the subject and has n't even hinted at a recovery plan .
830 985 Even if he did , a growing band of critics argues , he 's too weak physically and politically to launch any ambitious reforms before his term ends in 2000 .
986 1087 Always eager to show he 's still in charge , Yeltsin has fired the entire government twice this year .
1088 1104 But to what end ?
1105 1395 The new government , led by Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov , is a mishmash of politicians from various groups who are struggling to put together a coherent economic program Yeltsin , 67 , brushes aside worries about his health and says there is no chance he will quit before his term ends .
1396 1533 The Russian constitution makes impeachment an unlikely option , yet the clamor for Yeltsin 's resignation is louder than it 's ever been .
1534 1673 `` Every one of his public events is painful to watch , '' said Andrei Piontkovsky , a political analyst and harsh critic of the president .
1674 1696 `` He 's out of touch .
1697 1761 The state of his health and the state of mind are deplorable . ''
1762 1829 Several leading Russian newspapers have urged Yeltsin to step down .
1830 1983 They freely speculate about whether he has Alzheimer 's disease , or a return of heart problems that necessitated quintuple bypass surgery two years ago .
1984 2146 Yeltsin 's public approval rating is in the single digits , but the president 's hard-line foes have had difficulty turning this disenchantment into mass support .
2147 2317 Protests around the country on Oct. 7 drew about 1 million marchers , but the crowds were much smaller than predicted and have not resulted in any sustained labor unrest .
2318 2392 Still , the president is losing support from traditionally friendly camps .
2393 2589 `` Temporary incapacity is one thing , but if a person can not work and permanently perform his functions , he should muster the will and courage to say that , '' Moscow Mayor Luzhkov said Friday .
2590 2644 `` Everything now depends on the president himself . ''
2645 2813 Luzhkov , a likely presidential contender in 2000 , has been an ally of Yeltsin and has never before openly questioned the president 's health or his ability to govern .
2814 2898 Yeltsin normally relishes a good fight and is at his best at times of confrontation .
2899 2995 Yet he has responded to the economic crisis by keeping a profile so low it borders on reclusive .
2996 3156 He spends most days at a country residence to the west of Moscow , venturing into the Kremlin perhaps two or three times a week , and then only for a few hours .
3157 3322 Most public appearances are carefully controlled meetings in his Kremlin office , where he chitchats with government officials briefly for the benefit of the camera .
3323 3446 Last week 's trip to Central Asia was his first foreign journey in five months , and it proved a public relations disaster .
3447 3506 Yeltsin almost fell at a red carpet ceremony in Uzbekistan .
3507 3615 He canceled meetings , cut short a news conference and headed home a day early with a respiratory infection .
3616 3780 He has called off a trip to a summit in Malaysia next month , and government sources said one reason was concern about the effects of the long flight on his health .
3781 3963 If Yeltsin were to resign _ an unlikely scenario at this point _ then Primakov would take over as president temporarily and a presidential election would be held within three months .
3964 4088 The leading contenders would be Luzhkov , former security chief Alexander Lebed and Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov .
4089 4143 To some , the signs of a campaign are already visible .
4144 4254 `` It seems to me we are already in the middle of a new presidential race , '' said Piontkovsky , the analyst .
