110 328 When a church choir sang `` Jingle Bells , '' `` Silent Night '' and the `` Hallelujah Chorus '' of Handel 's `` Messiah '' this week on the steps of a cathedral , a crowd of several hundred listened in rapt attention .
329 385 But the appeal was based less on nostalgia than novelty .
386 503 The performance was in Havana , and it was the first of its kind in Cuba since Christmas was abolished there in 1970 .
504 633 Last year , president Fidel Castro granted a Christmas holiday as a one-time favor to Pope John Paul II before his January visit .
634 700 Last month , the government decided to make the holiday permanent .
701 771 The World 's Maria Zareyes tells us about a Cuban Christmas in Havana .
772 928 spkr : Maria_Zareyes Sunday Mass is well attended at this church in Havana , particularly as Catholics here prepared for the upcoming Christmas celebration .
929 1130 The priest at this parish , Father Jose Fernandez , says he 's pleased with the recent announcements by the Cuban government to reinstate the celebration of Christmas after three decades of suspension .
1131 1210 spkr : Father_Jose_Fernandez I think we 'll all enjoy this time of celebration .
1211 1251 It 's a victory for the people of faith .
1252 1378 We 're also happy because the Cuban people in general will be able to celebrate Christmas , Catholics and non-Catholics alike .
1379 1487 I can tell you that in the past five years , more people have been coming to Midnight Mass on Christmas Eve .
1488 1561 We hope that this year even more people will come to the church tomorrow .
1562 1709 spkr : Zareyes In the last few weeks , Father Jose Fernandez has been using his sermons to remind people of the religious meaning of Christmas Day .
1710 1863 His church , like many other churches across the island , have distributed a series of leaflets explaining the concept of Christmas in very simple terms .
1864 1981 spkr : Father_Fernandez I think by now , most Cubans know that Christmas is the time to celebrate the birth of Jesus .
1982 2098 I believe they also know that the Christmas tree is a symbol of life , just as Jesus is also life for us Christians .
2099 2203 spkr : Zareyes The celebration of Christmas in Cuba was never explicitly banned by the Cuban government .
2204 2313 But in 1970 , the authorities converted Christmas Day , December 25 , from a holiday to a normal working day .
2314 2368 Soon , Christmas was forgotten -- but not by everyone .
2369 2448 Nancy is a middle-aged Havana resident who does n't want to give her full name .
2449 2567 While shopping for ornaments for this year 's tree , she says that Christmas has always been important for her family .
2568 2617 spkr : Nancy We have always celebrated Christmas .
2618 2667 We have done it with what we 've had at the time .
2668 2704 We 've eaten what 's been available .
2705 2761 Those who wanted to maintain the tradition have done it .
2762 2901 spkr : Zareyes At this shopping center in Havana , only one store sells Christmas trees and a limited variety of ornaments and decorations .
2902 2953 A medium-sized tree can cost between $ 60 and $ 80 .
2954 3035 The smaller ones are more affordable , but the few available are all gone by now .
3036 3099 Nancy recalls the times when none of the things were available .
3100 3208 spkr : Nancy Now we have these things , but before , you could n't buy them because they were n't available .
3209 3254 As a Christmas tree , we used a dried branch .
3255 3335 We painted it and then decorated it with small boxes wrapped with colored paper .
3336 3409 We also used empty cans painted with different colors to put on the tree .
3410 3540 Now the state shops are selling these things to those who can afford them , of course , because they 're mainly priced in dollars .
3541 3599 And as you know , not many people here can afford dollars .
3600 3882 spkr : Zareyes As the Cubans prepare to celebrate Christmas , buying decorations and the traditional leg of pork to roast , the Catholic Church is taking the opportunity to spread its message that Christmas should be a religious and spiritual celebration and not a commercial feast .
3883 3928 For The World , I 'm Maria Zareyes in Havana .
