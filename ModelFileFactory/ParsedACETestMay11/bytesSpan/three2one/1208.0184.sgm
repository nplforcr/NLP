174 232 Probably , It Is SOME numbers rise to the level of poetry .
233 350 The 35 that 's attached to the dollar sign that 's attached to the leek and potato soup at Lespinasse is one of them .
351 503 In the same way that the Chrysler Building is more than a building , the $ 35 soup , teeming with white truffles and langoustines , is more than a soup .
504 606 It is a symbol , a beacon , a shiny new prototype in the grand factory of Manhattan restaurant dining .
607 721 With a stroke of the pen , Christian Delouvrier , the new chef at Lespinasse , has raised haute to new heights . ''
722 745 Thirty-five dollars ? ''
746 934 asked Alan Stillman , the president of the New York Restaurant Group , speaking , with an audible gasp , from Las Vegas , where he was overseeing the opening of a new Smith d Wollensky . ''
935 967 You sure that 's for one person ?
968 991 Maybe it 's for six . ''
992 1006 It 's for one .
1007 1239 In crude economic terms , the soup is a lagging indicator , proof positive that the long shadow cast by the stock market crash of 1987 , a calamity that took down the $ 35 plate of pasta right along with it , is well and truly over .
1240 1269 No one has set off fireworks .
1270 1343 The price of a roast-chicken entree has barely budged in the last decade .
1344 1557 But clever restaurant owners have engineered their menus to give their customers every opportunity to rack up big bills , from the mineral water and aperitif that start the meal to the desserts that finish it off .
1558 1610 And diners do not seem to be in the mood to say no. .
1611 1714 Many New Yorkers say they 've seen the evidence on their restaurant checks for the last three years . ''
1715 1922 I 'm stunned by the $ 9 bottled water , which is just sort of slipped in there at the beginning of the meal , '' said Andrea Schwan , a public relations consultant who represents architects and designers . ''
1923 1970 It 's like , ` Will it be still or sparkling ? '
1971 2109 I feel like saying , ` Well , I 'd really like Chateau Giuliani , ' but you feel it 's part of the experience , so you just go with it . ''
2110 2244 For some , it 's the simple salad that somehow crept up , from $ 7 to $ 10 , or the side order of garlic mashed potatoes , for $ 7.50 .
2245 2508 For others , it 's the 12-ounce cup of hot and sour shrimp from Daily Soup that runs $ 7.95 -LRB- served with a wedge of bread , a piece of fruit and cookie -RRB- , or the lunch-time entree that cracks the $ 30 barrier , like the sauteed veal chops at Limoncello .
2509 2607 The examples may differ , but the song is the same : dining in the city has become very expensive .
2608 2619 Is it true ?
2620 2686 New Yorkers react to food prices the same way they react to crime .
2687 2800 No matter what the statistics say , city residents can be counted on to tell pollsters that crime is on the rise .
2801 3071 The diner who has just been mugged by a bottle of sparkling water priced like a designer fragrance -LRB- $ 5 for a half liter at the '' 21 '' Club and $ 12 a liter at Harry Cipriani -RRB- is likewise inclined to believe that restaurant prices have gone through the roof .
3072 3315 The closest thing the city has to a database on restaurant prices is the annual Zagat Survey , which , although comprehensive , must be read with a certain degree of caution , since the information comes from an army of unmonitored volunteers .
3316 3552 According to the 1999 survey , which includes data through the end of June 1998 , the price of a dinner , defined as an appetizer , an entree and a drink , has risen from $ 29.38 in mid-1994 to $ 31.68 , an increase of almost 8 percent .
3553 3685 For the 20 most expensive restaurants in the city , the price of a dinner rose from $ 63.45 to $ 68.56 , also an 8 percent increase .
3686 3799 In the last year , prices rose 3.2 percent over all , but only 0.4 percent for the 20 most expensive restaurants .
3800 3898 So , why do many diners feel as though they are spending a lot , lot more when they go out to eat ?
3899 4017 Probably because they are , even though their spending patterns are not likely to be reflected in the Zagat Survey . ''
4018 4310 A lot of my clients are telling me that their checks are up dramatically , but I ca n't remember the last time any of them have raised prices , '' said Gary Levy , a partner in Arthur D. Levy , an accounting firm whose clients include Bouley Bakery , Jean Georges , Aquavit and Mesa Grill . ''
4311 4423 The smarter operators realize that if you train your staff to sell properly , you get a higher check average . ''
4424 4502 The operators are making sure that their staff members have something to sell .
4503 4918 While holding the line on the basic roast chicken , they have added enticing options at the higher price ranges , loaded on higher-priced specials , expanded their lists of wine by the glass , pushed the bottled water hard and in general -LRB- very much like car dealers -RRB- festooned their menus with so many tempting options that the Zagat figure seems more like a theoretical construct than an achievable goal .
4919 5220 Pastry , a high-markup category , plays a much greater role than it did even a few years ago , with pastry chefs getting their own menus and star billing not only at restaurants like Le Cirque 2000 or Gramercy Tavern but also at more modest establishments like 27 Standard or Club Raleigh at the Oaks .
5221 5429 Wine by the glass , another profit center , has taken off as well , thanks in part to fancy new vacuum dioxide machines that make it possible to open an expensive bottle and preserve it for as long as a week .
5430 5737 The once-standard $ 5 glass of pedestrian California chardonnay -LRB- these days more like $ 8 -RRB- now inhabits a thickly populated list that teems with moneymaking opportunities , especially among the lesser-known brands that can take a big markup , since customers are unlikely to know the retail price .
5738 5992 At Veruka in SoHo , most customers will know that $ 9 for a glass of 1995 Rosemount Estate is not much of a value , since a bottle sells at retail for $ 10 , but will they know how to size up the $ 18 price tag on a glass of 1993 Ferrari-Carano cabernet ?
5993 6031 -LRB- It retails for about $ 23 . -RRB-
6032 6092 At every turn diners have every opportunity to spend big . ''
6093 6175 We 've gone the option route , '' said Steve Scher , an owner of Union Pacific . ''
6176 6342 We have a $ 59 prix fixe menu , which we regard as good value , but the menu also presents you with options to build a meal that results in a more expensive check . ''
6343 6460 A little foie gras here , a flight of amuse-bouche there , an excursion into the $ 110 tasting menu -- it can add up .
6461 6488 Union Pacific is not alone .
6489 6543 Fixed-price fever has gripped the city 's restaurants .
6544 6607 Diners like prix fixe because they know what the check will be .
6608 6802 Restaurants like it because it commits customers to a meal that may very well be more expensive than the one they would order a la carte , especially since it commits them to eating desserts . ''
6803 6999 Within the confines of a prix fixe menu , you can hide all sorts of extravagant items , '' said Drew Nieporent , whose Myriad Group owns Nobu , the TriBeCa Grill and other high-end restaurants . ''
7000 7079 A $ 75 menu is probably a $ 25 appetizer , a $ 35 entree and a $ 15 dessert . ''
7080 7199 Restaurant owners have been hesitant to do much more than nickel-and-dime the menu on the basic appetizers and entrees .
7200 7304 When Le Cirque 2000 opened in 1997 , its owner , Sirio Macchioni , declared a two-year freeze on prices .
7305 7354 Fear not , the rack of lamb holds steady at $ 38 .
7355 7509 Rather than raising prices at Arizona 206 , the Santo family shut the place down and installed Bolivar , a moderately priced South American restaurant . ''
7510 7672 We did not feel a renovation was enough of a rationale for higher prices , '' said Andy D'Amico , a partner in the Santo Family Group , which owns the restaurant .
7673 7836 The group is currently shopping for the kind of grand premises that will enable it to position Arizona 206 as a haute-Southwestern restaurant with prices to match .
7837 7857 This is the paradox .
7858 7950 New York , flush with Wall Street money , has a lot of loose change jangling in its pockets .
7951 8140 But restaurant owners who remember the last recession are reluctant to raise menu prices across the board , especially with increased competition from a rush of new high-priced restaurants .
8141 8418 It takes a grand opening , or the arrival of an important chef , like Mr. Delouvrier , making a major statement , to crank prices up to a heroic level -- like the $ 22 prawn cocktail at the newly opened Rage , or the $ 26 pumpkin risotto at La Fourchette , another newcomer . ''
8419 8735 When we see the prices at Lespinasse , we get an overall impression that there 's fluidity in the market , but there is a certain threshold that , if you cross it , you have to justify it , '' said John Harding , the vice president of marketing at Restaurant Associates , the group that owns Cafe Centro and Tropica .
8736 8837 The money is out there , in other words , but restaurants have to employ guile and stealth to get it .
8838 8893 Which still leaves one question about the $ 35 soup . ''
8894 9013 As an Italian , '' Mr. Macchioni said , '' I have to wonder , what are white truffles doing in a soup to begin with ? ''
9014 9014 .
