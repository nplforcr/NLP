Coattail Effect In Rowland 's Big Victory WATERTOWN , Conn. , Nov. 4 - Despite a commanding re-election victory on Tuesday , Gov. John G. Rowland may be finding that it is lonely at the top .
381 767 He trounced Representative Barbara B. Kennelly by 28 percentage points , but failed to sweep along any of his four fellow Republicans seeking statewide offices , or the Republican running for United States Senate , or either of the Congressional candidates he had been promoting , or enough new State Senators to give his party control of the chamber after two years in the minority . ''
768 925 The emperor has no coattails , '' said Matthew Miller , the spokesman for the state Democratic Party 's campaign arm , the Campaign for Connecticut Families .
926 978 Interestingly , '' the emperor '' makes few excuses .
979 1192 Governor Rowland , who was in an even chattier and more casual mood than usual today , said he had been warning for weeks that '' all politics is local , '' and that he could not transfer his popularity to others .
1193 1324 He gave other major Republican candidates a hand by speaking at their fund-raising receptions and starring in their television ads .
1325 1442 But he rarely hit the campaign trail with them , which his staff said was not the most efficient way for him to help .
1443 1652 Just a dozen years ago , Mr. Rowland 's entire team likely would have been elected , since Connecticut 's voting machines still had a party lever , which allowed voters to choose an entire slate automatically .
1653 1731 In a ballot question in 1986 , voters narrowly decided to eliminate the lever .
1732 1797 Ironically , the drive to have it removed was led by Republicans .
1798 1909 Regardless of the pain it caused him this week , Mr. Rowland said he still thinks it was the right decision . ''
1910 1946 A lever is too easy , '' he said . ''
1947 2054 We basically were saying to people , ` You 're not smart enough to pick the candidates of your choice . ' ''
2055 2185 One statewide race remained undecided tonight , although Mr. Rowland said he had been told that the Republican incumbent had lost .
2186 2384 The State Treasurer , Paul J. Silvester , was deadlocked at 49 percent with his Democratic challenger , Denise Nappier , who was ahead by 1,670 votes in the unofficial tally by The Associated Press .
2385 2537 A spokesman for the Secretary of the State 's office said an official result would be released Thursday , when a decision would be made about a recount .
2538 2784 United States Senator Christopher J. Dodd , a Democrat who defeated his Republican challenger , Gary A. Franks , by 33 percentage points , said he would leave it to others to judge whether it was his coattails that pulled in so many Democrats . ''
2785 2978 While the Governor is a good campaigner and had a strong campaign , I believe our candidates for these other offices were better and stronger candidates '' than the Republicans , Mr. Dodd said .
2979 3127 One Democratic strategist said the Campaign for Connecticut Families made an agonizing choice that helps explain Mr. Rowland 's dearth of coattails .
3128 3299 Through telephone calls and mailings , the group identified many voters who planned to vote for Mr. Rowland , but would support Democrats for the offices on the ballot . ''
3300 3364 We faced a difficult decision : Do you turn out those voters ? ''
3365 3384 the strategistsaid .
3385 3482 This can be done by phoning people just before the election and offering them rides to the polls .
3483 3609 So the choice boiled down to whether to sacrifice votes for Mrs. Kennelly to help elect other Democrats , the strategist said .
3610 3813 In many towns where legislative races were tight , the Democrats decided that because Mrs. Kennelly 's campaign was not competitive , they should try to turn out the Democratic supporters of Mr. Rowland .
3814 3871 That decision , the strategist said , helped Ms. Nappier .
3872 4058 While others huddled for post-mortems , Mr. Rowland , 41 , celebrated his victory today by heading off for vacation at a warm but otherwise unspecified destination with his wife , Patty .
4059 4165 Before he left , he made what has become his traditional post-election stop at a metal-molding plant here .
4166 4324 Scores of delighted workers crowded around , to get a glimpse of the Governor , who was wearing pleated-front Dockers and a forest-green , cable-knit sweater .
4325 4443 An exit poll of 1,459 Connecticut voters by Voter News Service showed the breadth and depth of Mr. Rowland 's victory .
4444 4535 There was little gender gap : he got 64 percent of men 's votes and 61 percent of women 's .
4536 4692 He won in nearly every category of voters except blacks , liberals and Democrats -- and even 45 percent of blacks and 38 percent of Democrats voted for him .
4693 4871 Voters began splitting their tickets , however , when it came to races for the State Senate , where Republicans needed to pick up just two seats to regain control of the chamber .
4872 4995 Democratic leaders in the State Senate held a news conference today to trumpet the preservation of their 19-to-17 majority .
4996 5115 The Majority Leader , Senator George C. Jepsen , needled the Governor for his ever-more-moderate position on issues . ''
5116 5239 We are delighted Governor Rowland chose in the last year to basically adopt the Democratic agenda , '' Senator Jepsen said .
5240 5382 The Senate President Pro Tempore , Kevin B. Sullivan , added , '' I expect he would continue to work with us , continue to follow our lead . ''
5383 5515 Mr. Rowland did not take the bait , but simply said he was looking forward to continuing to work with the Legislature 's leaders . ''
5516 5724 A few days from now , everybody catches their breath and the campaign fades away and we realize we 've got to do a budget , and we 've got a legislative session starting up in a couple months , '' he said . ''
5725 5766 We put on our game gear and off we go . ''
5767 5847 Several defeated Republicans said they did not blame Mr. Rowland for their loss .
5848 5992 Nevertheless , his lack of coattails gave Democrats a rare chance to gloat in a year when the Governor has dominated the political landscape . ''
5993 6100 He was n't wearing a coat , '' said Susan Bysiewicz , a Democrat who was elected Secretary of the State . ''
6101 6126 He was wearing a vest . ''
6127 6127 .
