0 465 1130.0351 NEWS STORY SECTION : Section A ; Page 4 ; Column 3 ; Foreign Desk LENGTH : 957 DATE : December 1 , 1998 HEADLINE : Mexico City Journal ; Above the Law : Bodyguards Swell a Wave of Crime MEXICO CITY , Nov. 30 - The newest danger awaiting motorists on the mean streets of Mexico City comes from revolver-waving bodyguards in speeding unmarked cars , who swerve from lane to lane to make sure no one gets close to the chauffeur-driven limousines they follow .
466 573 A bump from one such escort car almost sent Humberto Cantu and his humble Ford sedan careering into a tree .
574 692 Mr. Cantu , a radio disk jockey on his way to work , caught up to the bodyguards at the next stoplight to berate them .
693 737 One of them pointed a pistol at his nose . ''
738 783 Relax , buddy , '' the man told Mr. Cantu . ''
784 822 Ca n't you see that we 're working ? ''
823 1014 In the last two years , violent crime in the capital and other major Mexican cities has surged out of control while police forces , disabled by decades of corruption , have all but collapsed .
1015 1142 So rare is it for the capital 's regular police officers to stop a crime that they often make newspaper headlines when they do .
1143 1293 As a result , frightened citizens who need help to defend their loved ones or their property have turned to private security guards , legions of them .
1294 1463 The huge growth of private security is a new complication for Mexico 's efforts -- so far in vain -- to subdue a tidal wave of crime , especially robbery and kidnapping .
1464 1587 Most guards are armed but few are trained or licensed , and the authorities acknowledge they have little control over them .
1588 1720 Abuses against unsuspecting passers-by grow more frequent every day , as do violent crimes by crooks posing as private policemen . ''
1721 1992 We have allowed a bunch of fly-by-night security companies to arm a huge number of people , basically an entire army , '' said Victor Manuel Soto Camacho , a Mexico City councilman from the opposition Party of the Democratic Revolution who is an expert on local crime . ''
1993 2079 In many cases our citizens , instead of getting security , are getting more danger . ''
2080 2148 In affluent neighborhoods , the bodyguards seem to rule the streets .
2149 2297 They strong-arm pedestrians , charge through red lights and brandish weapons , all in the name of defending '' the boss , '' whoever that may be . ''
2298 2341 Who has not been insulted or threatened ? ''
2342 2391 Arnoldo Kraus , a newspaper columnist , wrote . ''
2392 2450 All because we deign to travel on the same street as them .
2451 2566 The aggression of those wardens of 25-year-old rich kids and their Mercedeses and BMW 's is downright degrading . ''
2567 2676 Nationwide , 200,000 Mexicans are employed as guards by some 3,000 private companies , industry figures show .
2677 2740 Only 275 companies are properly registered with the Government .
2741 2847 As many as 90,000 private guards work in Mexico City , 11,000 more than the number of uniformed policemen .
2848 3029 The tradition of private bodyguards is not new in Mexico , which even contributed its own word for them to the Spanish lexicon : '' guaruras , '' a term handed down from the Aztecs .
3030 3280 Its original meaning is not known , but the current one , according to a standard dictionary of Mexican phraseology , is unambiguous : '' A strong and overbearing individual ready to draw his weapon , who is in charge of protecting another person . ''
3281 3386 In past decades only the most powerful politicians and conspicuous tycoons had their own security guards .
3387 3500 Now practically any office building , middle-class neighborhood or prominent business executive needs protection .
3501 3705 Even Homero Aridjis , a leading intellectual who is the president of the writers ' group International PEN , travels with burly men at his back since he received telephone death threats late last year . ''
3706 3760 We live in a culture of fear , '' Mr. Aridjis said . ''
3761 3858 And we do n't really know if the men watching out for us are good or bad , honest or criminal . ''
3859 3896 The guaruras ' style is unmistakable .
3897 4037 They gather in forbidding clusters outside business conferences and power-elite restaurants during Mexico City 's late-afternoon lunch hour .
4038 4164 Their vehicles of choice are either a Chrysler Spirit or a Dodge Stratus , with hubcaps removed and four doors for quick exit .
4165 4302 A heavy black steel grate , known as a burro-bouncer , shields the front fender so the driver can ram other cars without denting his own .
4303 4329 Subtlety is not a feature .
4330 4402 The guaruras all seem to wear shiny suits , black ties and dark glasses .
4403 4514 Their belts hang heavy with beepers and cellular phones and their jackets bulge with barely concealed handguns .
4515 4580 They ride four to a car , each one peering warily out his window .
4581 4715 And Mr. Cantu , the disk jockey , is an example of what happens to the unwary driver who wanders in between them and their clients . ''
4716 4936 A professional bodyguard should be discreet , '' said Ramon Requeijo Abad , president of the Mexican branch of Nutronica , an international security company that is one of the few to fully screen and train its guards . ''
4937 5001 But in this country they love to make a show of their arrogance .
5002 5058 If there is a fight , they jump in and make it worse . ''
5059 5162 Most guards are not personal escorts but lowly watchmen , standing duty in stores and building lobbies .
5163 5274 Often they make less than $ 50 a week , so the incentive is for them to commit crimes rather than prevent them .
5275 5400 Over the last year the city police have seen a rash of break-ins that appear to be inside jobs by doormen and night watchmen .
5401 5532 Police Chief Alejandro Gertz Manero opened a campaign in Mexico City recently to impose tight supervision on the security industry .
5533 5676 He wants all guards to be registered and to pass drug , psychological and weapons-handling tests as well as undergo criminal-background checks .
5677 5809 Mr. Gertz started the crackdown after he noticed two police patrol cars escorting a private vehicle , a practice that is prohibited .
5810 5962 After stopping the patrol cars himself , he quickly discovered that they were private vehicles illegally painted with the colors of the police force . ''
5963 6040 Everyone has the right to seek protection for himself , '' Mr. Gertz said . ''
6041 6098 No one has to the right to offend or humiliate others . ''
6099 6099 .
