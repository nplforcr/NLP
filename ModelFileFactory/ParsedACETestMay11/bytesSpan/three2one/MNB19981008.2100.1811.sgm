0 185 MNB19981008 .2100.1811 NEWS STORY 10/08/1998 21:30:11.48 Tonight we have with us two members of Congress who took part in today 's historic vote to hold open-ended impeachment hearings .
186 296 Representative is aia hutch I son is a republican from Arkansas and a member of the house Judiciary committee .
297 337 He 's with us tonight from Capitol Hill .
338 456 Also with us from Washington , Dennis Kucinich , a democratic feshman from Ohio whose vote came as a surprise to some .
457 568 Congressman Kucinich , your vote did come as a surprise because you 're not in any sort of tight election race .
569 641 Your district is solidly democratic so why did you vote the way you did ?
642 757 I think the whole nation gets to get above this and beyond it and the only way to do that is to have open hearings .
758 867 People want to make sure the truth is brought out , so bring the truth forward and then let 's get beyond it .
868 1056 There are so many important matters to address in this country and the world but we ca n't do it until we definitively dismiss this case , and we ca n't dismiss it without having hearings .
1057 1159 But there is a question of open-endedness and there 's no -- This hearing will end with this Congress .
1160 1409 Congress would then have to reauthorize it and I think it would be very difficult if Congress is not successful in moving things forward with dispatch , because the fact of the matter is the American people want it done with , but they want closure .
1410 1566 They do n't want a cover-up and the only way we can really do justice to the nation and to the president is to make sure that the facts are brought forward .
1567 1603 Let the accusers present their case .
1604 1653 They 've never been subject to cross-examination .
1654 1746 Give the President a chance to clear himself , and let 's get above this and then beyond it .
1747 1809 Congressman Hutchinson , do you believe that is the way to go ?
1810 1895 I believe the congressman stated it very well and I admire him for what he did today .
1896 2146 I think the fact there were 31 democrats that supported the resolution that was presented shows that this is -- there 's bipartisan support for this inquiry and even those who did not support the Hyde proposal , they supported the idea of an inquiry .
2147 2246 Minority leader Gephardt indicated there is consensus in this body that we need to have an inquiry .
2247 2376 There was some dispute as to the procedures of it , but I think we 're ready to go forward and bring a conclusion to this matter .
2377 2453 Now Mr. Hutchinson , Mr. Kucinich was only one of 31 democrats who defected .
2454 2528 That was far short of some of the estimates we heard which were up to 100 .
2529 2594 That is not exactly a resounding victory for republicans , is it ?
2595 2673 I do n't think we 're looking at it whether it 's a republican victory or not .
2674 2834 I think what 's important is the American people look behind just a vote and see there was a clear consensus on a bipartisan basis for a number of things today .
2835 2872 One , that we should have an inquiry .
2873 2914 Secondly , that this is a serious matter .
2915 3007 Thirdly , that it 's a vote of conscience , and fourthly that we want to get this over with .
3008 3045 Clearly that had broad support today .
3046 3129 Now it broke down a little bit on the fine points , but that was broadly supported .
3130 3291 The American people I think can see there 's something to build on , that we can move forward , and I hope that the bipartisanship will increase as time goes on .
3292 3344 Congressman Kucinich , let 's get back to your vote .
3345 3509 There were some who said there was exceeding pressure from the White House , even the first lady on democratic members of Congress to support the president on this .
3510 3536 What contact did you have ?
3537 3565 Did anyone try to lobby you ?
3566 3571 None .
3572 3588 None whatsoever .
3589 3619 And people ought to know that .
3620 3694 This is one member who did n't receive a single call from the White House .
3695 3759 No one asked me for my vote or asked me how I was going to vote .
3760 3984 I was able to cast a vote based on the way that I felt -- things ought to move forward and it 's not done not as an attack on the president because there are plenty of supporters of the president that voted to have hearings .
3985 4072 It was done to give this country a chance to move forward and finally get some closure .
4073 4241 If we continue the debate as to whether we should have hearings , then we 'll never get to -- an opportunity to review the facts in the Starr report in an open hearing .
4242 4346 That 's what I think we need to do , but we ca n't do it in a way that it just keeps dragging on and on .
4347 4537 The American people expect this thing to be wrapped up and if there 's enough facts to review , let the committee move forward and let 's get on with the rest of the business of the country .
4538 4706 Do you personally think that what the -- what the president is alleged to have done rises to the level of impeachable offenses , even to Washington removal from office ?
4707 4756 Well , that 's why we 're going to have hearings .
4757 4822 If you do n't have hearings , you ca n't make that determination .
4823 4923 I mean , based on what 's in the Starr report , I think they 're going to need a lot more than that .
4924 4962 Need to have the report brought forth .
4963 5016 Linda Tripp needs to be brought before the committee .
5017 5094 I mean , that 's -- I voted for hearings to make sure that the truth was out .
5095 5199 Let 's shine some light on all this and give the American people a chance to settle it once and for all .
5200 5275 But there is no closure , if you just skip over the whole idea of hearings .
5276 5307 There was going to be hearings .
5308 5363 There was no question there was going to be an inquiry .
5364 5449 I say let 's move forward with it and let 's get on with the business of the country .
5450 5612 Today your reports talk about the stock market up and down , world economy is in a mess , problems in Kosovo with people dying , freezing out there in the forest .
5613 5649 Those are problems that are serious .
5650 5720 We do n't know yet how serious the problems are before that committee .
5721 5831 But we know that we better get that committee hearing over and then address the rest of the world 's problems .
5832 6007 OK , congressman Hutchinson , if we are to in congressman Kucinich 's words , to settle this once and for all , should the president have to go up to Capitol Hill and testify ?
6008 6056 It 's the president 's conduct that 's at issue .
6057 6210 Very serious charges of obstruction of justice , witness-tampering , and there 's a dispute in the evidence , the president has denied these allegations .
6211 6319 And if he desires to come to Capitol Hill and testify , I 'm sure that opportunity would be afforded to him .
6320 6526 I do n't think we should subpoena him and I do n't believe we should request him to out of deaf reference to the president but if he wants to present his defense accident he 'll have opportunity to do that .
6527 6687 If I may respond to what he just said , I think anytime President Clinton has had a chance to bring his case forward , he 's also done so well and successfully .
6688 6877 Any time new information has been brought out , it 's generally been helpful to the White House , so I think these hearings could produce an opportunity for the White House to clear itself .
6878 6943 All right , gentlemen , I believe we will have to leave it there .
6944 7020 Thank you very much , representative Hutchinson and representative Kucinich .
