0 131 ABC19981116 .1830.0759 NEWS STORY 11/16/1998 18:42:39.56 Now our regular report on how the government sometimes misuses your money .
132 252 Historically , black colleges have received federal funding to further their mission of educating young black Americans .
253 311 So , what happens when a black college is no longer black ?
312 343 Here 's ABC 's Michelle Norris .
344 454 Reporter : This is bluefield state college , one of the nation 's 105 historically black colleges -- or is it ?
455 520 When I go to class , I 'm the only black and female in the class .
521 597 Till I came here , I did n't even know it was an historically black college .
598 661 Reporter : At bluefield it 's not just a problem of appearance .
662 776 Historically , black colleges automatically qualify for federal funds that are meant to help needy black students .
777 847 That was once the mission at bluefield state , but times have changed .
848 934 Today there are few visible signs that the school once served an all-black population .
935 1118 And yet the school continues to receive more than $ 1 million a year in federal funding earmarked for black institutions of higher learning , even though the school is now 93 % white .
1119 1184 Of the school 's 2,300 students , about 200 are African-American .
1185 1271 If you look around , there 's not a lot of blacks , there 's not a lot of black staff .
1272 1346 Reporter : In fact , only 2 of the school 's 80 faculty members are black .
1347 1376 And how do we define culture ?
1377 1423 Reporter : And both were hired just this fall .
1424 1569 One professor has sued bluefield state for collecting millions of dollars of your money , even though the school is a black college in name only .
1570 1667 Maybe legally they do , but , you know , I do n't think morally they have a Right to those funds .
1668 1733 Reporter : Even the federal government admits there is a problem .
1734 1840 There is a legitimate and serious question about whether they deserve to continue to receive that funding .
1841 1975 Reporter : But that has n't stopped the government from doling out handouts and it has n't stopped the school from accepting the cash .
1976 2009 There 's a limited pool of money .
2010 2014 yes .
2015 2115 Reporter : So if you 're getting $ 1 million , that 's $ 1 million that someone else is not getting .
2116 2163 But I 'm not making that decision on the thing .
2164 2203 I 'm just putting through the proposal .
2204 2274 As an institution , we seek out those things that we are eligible for .
2275 2374 Reporter : Whether or not the school remains eligible is a question that only Congress can resolve .
2375 2521 But until that happens , this historically black , yet predominantly white college , will continue collecting $ 1 million of your money each year .
