147 252 The Ohio state Supreme Court gave the son of Dr. Sam sheppard another chance to clear his father 's name .
253 275 Holly Firfer has more .
276 361 Reporter : For ten years , Sam Reese sheppard has fought to clear his father 's name .
362 458 Sam and I are thrilled that maybe before the end of the century , we will put this case to rest .
459 590 Reporter : The decision by the Ohio Supreme Court means sheppard can proceed with his wrongful imprisonment suit against the state .
591 696 It could also mean his father , Dr. Sam sheppard , will officially be found innocent of a horrible crime .
697 738 It was a very violent , passionate crime .
739 839 Reporter : Fred drenkin was the first police officer on the scene at the sheppard home back in 1954 .
840 901 He found the body of Marilyn sheppard in an upstairs bedroom .
902 942 She had been brutally beaten and killed .
943 996 Dr. sheppard claimed an intruder committed the crime .
997 1050 But the police did n't buy it and neither did a jury .
1051 1119 Dr. sheppard was convicted of murdering his wife and sent to prison .
1120 1162 I do n't know who else would have done it .
1163 1216 Reporter : But sheppard won the right to a new trial .
1217 1272 And 12 years later , another jury found him not guilty .
1273 1312 The son says , that 's not good enough .
1313 1381 It still suggests that people somehow had a good lawyer and got off .
1382 1467 Reporter : For sheppard to win this case , his father will have to be found innocent .
1468 1522 And the son could collect some $ 2 million in damages .
1523 1705 I think it 's just very sad and very pathetic that people have to either claim that I 'm some kind of loony or some kind of money grubber over my -- the bodies of my dead loved ones .
1706 1779 Reporter : New DNA evidence suggests others may have committed the crime .
1780 1823 But drenkin sees no point in another trial .
1824 1889 I just do n't understand how we keep rehashing it , rehashing it .
1890 1924 And there 's always a new suspect .
1925 1944 And it never stops .
1945 2036 Reporter : It 's been nearly 45 years and the case of Marilyn sheppard is still not closed .
