173 303 But you can bet a stack of baseball trading cards that New Yorkers and San Diegoans are n't the only fans with a rooting interest .
304 435 In Tokyo , American journalist Ken Belsan says that the baseball-loving Japanese might be a little late for work during the series .
436 584 spkr : Ken_Belsan All the American finales , the World Series , the NBA finals , the Super Bowl , for sure , get covered on cable TV , usually live .
585 676 In the World Series case , it 'll be about six , seven in the morning on satellite TV here .
677 713 And most people will be watching it .
714 772 If you 're a sports fan , you 'll watch American baseball .
773 900 spkr : Cahn The Japanese fans will actually get a double dose of baseball because their own world series starts tomorrow , too .
901 991 The match-up will see the favored Sable Lions going up against the Yokohoma - based Stars .
992 1133 Ken Belsan says that while many Japanese will be pulling for the underdog-based Stars , they 're not inclined to pull for the upstart Padres .
1134 1295 spkr : Belsan Most Japanese look to America as the standard for most things , and certainly in sports , they root for the Michael Jordans and the Dallas Cowboys .
1296 1407 And I think in this case , they 'll probably look at the Yankees as the team that 's quintessentially American .
1408 1538 Most Japanese , certainly the older generation , think of Americans and America as Cadillacs , Elvis , canned beer and big steaks .
1539 1599 And the Yankees , of course , fit into that motto , I think .
