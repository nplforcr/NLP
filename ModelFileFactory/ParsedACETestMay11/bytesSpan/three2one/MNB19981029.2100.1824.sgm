0 123 MNB19981029 .2100.1824 NEWS STORY 10/29/1998 21:30:24.26 Frank : Proceedings about to get under way in 40 minutes from now .
124 172 We welcome Michael gerhardt joins us throughout .
173 217 Mike and I , seen joined by Jeff Greenfield .
218 277 Folks let 's talk about the bipartisan we heard talk about .
278 410 In the end if this comes down to a straight party vote , the president would n't be convicted and there would n't be bipartisanship .
411 515 In the end as we saw with Andrew Johnson there were radical republicans who saved the party by one vote .
516 562 What has to happen to get to that model again .
563 706 I think as you pointed out radical republicans broke with the party and voted to acquit President Johnson was a defining moment for that event .
707 754 That helps us understand that particular event .
755 936 But I think something dramatic , something different , new is going to have to happen here , that would probably lead to a greater sort of bipartisanship than we have seen thus far .
937 1004 My own feeling is that a party line vote will be seen as just that .
1005 1093 And therefore , I 'm trying to picture what happens after a certain stage in this trial .
1094 1284 For instance , after the presentation and prewitness one could imagine 6 republicans the northeast moderates we 've heard so much about saying enough already and voting to adjourn the trial .
1285 1361 The converse , the idea of democrats breaking with the president to convict .
1362 1593 You almost ca n't imagine that happening without witnesses showing up and saying something or behaving with demeanor in such a way that democrats who are disposed to vote with the president suddenly say uo something worse happened .
1594 1686 The republican move earlier to adjourn and the democratic drift to break with the president .
1687 1748 Jeanne : Michael let me ask you about expectations for today .
1749 1820 How will this be like a conventional trial , how will it be dissimilar .
1821 1837 Very dissimilar .
1838 1852 It 's helpful .
1853 1888 This is different in many respects .
1889 1997 You have the chief justice presiding over this proceeding , he does n't proceed over trial-like proceedings .
1998 2025 You have the senators mute .
2026 2066 They are acting as more man just jurors .
2067 2154 This is their proceeding , they are in control of the the direction of this proceeding .
2155 2198 They can end it or prolong it at any point .
2199 2230 That makes this very different .
2231 2354 Moreover , the house managers and the had thes lawyers will be constrained in a certain respect with what they can present .
2355 2493 They will be able to present things only to the extent the senators allow them to present those things this will have a different dynamic .
2494 2541 Frank : Michael gerhardt we 'll be back to you .
2542 2558 Jeff Greenfield .
