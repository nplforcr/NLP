0 237 VOA19981106 .0500.0674 NEWS STORY 11/06/1998 5:11:14.53 In the United States , an organization known as the Feminist Majority has launched a campaign on behalf of women in Afghanistan that it alleges are mistreated by the ruling Taliban .
238 347 Mavis Leno is a member of the organization 's board and the wife of the popular television comedian Jay Leno .
348 481 She spoke with VOA 's Tom Crosby and told him that for her , it was the right time to take up the cause of the women in that country .
482 587 spkr : Mavis_Leno A lot of things that I was interested in and felt strongly about coalesced at one time .
588 679 I had joined the Feminist Majority because I wanted to basically make sure of three things .
680 802 I wanted to make sure that the advances women have made in America in this century do n't roll back , as they have before .
803 953 I want to make sure that a new generation of feminist-oriented young women grow up with help from those of us who were in the front lines in the '70s .
954 1006 And the Feminist Majority handles both those issues .
1007 1172 And I also had felt for a long time that American women were in a strong enough position now to look to women in third world countries and offer them a helping hand .
1173 1334 And so when I heard what was going on in Afghanistan , which I first learned about when I joined the board of the Feminist Majority , everything fell into place .
1335 1452 spkr : Tom_Crosby Once you got involved in this , did you get any response from the people of Afghanistan themselves ?
1453 1630 spkr : Leno It 's very difficult to get response from the people inside Afghanistan because the Taliban have cut off pretty much all the means by which people could communicate .
1631 1693 They do n't allow TV , they do n't allow foreign observers in .
1694 1868 They really -- if they did n't need money so badly , which they do , they probably would do what Albania did and just completely sever their links with the rest of the world .
1869 2189 However , I have spoken to many , many people who are emigres from Afghanistan and are trying desperately to do something about the plight of their country , and a lot of people that I 've spoken to work with the women in the refugee camps who fled Afghanistan after the takeover and are now living in camps in Pakistan .
2190 2284 And these people honestly feel , these women , that America , the West , is their last chance .
2285 2446 One woman said in the course of the -- a highly illegal interview that she gave -- anonymously , of course -- that the women of Afghanistan are the walking dead .
2447 2533 So unless we can get them out , there 's very little chance for them to be gotten out .
2534 2589 spkr : Westpheling Mavis Leno of the Feminist Majority .
