289 522 dQL ; ARUSHA , Tanzania -LRB- AP -RRB- _ A U.N. court on Friday ordered a former Rwandan mayor to serve three life sentences for convictions of genocide and crimes against humanity , plus 80 years for other violations including rape .
523 687 In the first judgment by an international court on genocide , Jean-Paul Akayesu was convicted Sept. 2 of nine counts of genocide , crimes against humanity and rape .
688 852 Akayesu had made an impassioned plea Monday for forgiveness from the Rwandan people for the genocide of more than 500,000 people , mostly minority Tutsis , in 1994 .
853 1057 However , Judge Laity Kama said Friday Akayesu `` chose to participate in the genocide , '' and should therefore spend the rest of his life in prison , according to the Swiss-based Hirondelle news agency .
1058 1166 `` The chamber is of the opinion ... that genocide constitutes the crime of crimes , '' Kama told the court .
1167 1274 Akayesu was ordered to serve the sentences concurrently , which means he will serve a single life sentence .
1275 1344 Akayesu stood silently , showing no emotion as the sentence was read .
1345 1495 The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda was formed in November 1994 , months after an extremist Hutu government sponsored the 90-day slaughter .
1496 1566 The genocide ended only when Tutsi-led rebels took power in July 1994 .
1567 1698 Akayesu , who was born in 1953 , was mayor of the central village of Taba where 2,000 Tutsis who sought his protection were killed .
1699 1778 He has maintained his innocence , claiming he was unable to stop the slaughter .
1779 1933 Acting in his own defense during his pre-sentencing hearing Monday , Akayesu said remorsefully , `` I regret what happened from the bottom of my heart . ''
1934 1993 He also asked for God 's forgiveness , Hirondelle reported .
1994 2140 Prosecutor Pierre Prosper called the former mayor a predator and asked for seven life sentences plus additional lesser sentences for other crimes .
2141 2253 He later said he was satisfied with Akayesu 's life sentence , the maximum penalty the U.N. tribunal can impose .
2254 2313 Akayesu has appealed his convictions , Hirondelle reported .
2314 2473 The tribunal , in Akayesu 's precedent-setting judgment , had ruled that rape and sexual violence were brutally wielded as tools of genocide in Rwanda in 1994 .
2474 2585 No one accused Akayesu personally of rape , but many witnesses said he incited the sexual abuse of Tutsi women .
2586 2624 He was sentenced to 15 years for rape .
2625 2773 During the 20-month trial , Akayesu fired his defense team three times , most recently on Monday , and has represented himself on several occasions .
2774 2818 The tribunal is holding 31 people in Arusha .
2819 2857 Another person is in custody in Texas .
2858 2906 Friday 's sentencing was the tribunal 's second .
2907 3018 Ex-Prime Minister Jean Kambanda , 42 , pleaded guilty in May and was sentenced to life imprisonment on Sept. 4 .
3019 3120 Rwandan courts have tried at least 330 people in the genocide , and 116 have been sentenced to death .
3121 3210 A total of 126,078 people are imprisoned and awaiting trial , according to the Red Cross .
3211 3335 On April 24 , the Rwandan government executed 22 genocide convicts by firing squad , the first executions for the slaughter .
3336 3426 At the Yugoslav tribunal , two men have received sentences , but neither was for genocide .
3427 3550 All those accused in the post-World War II Nuremberg trials pleaded innocent to charges including murder and extermination .
3551 3627 The trials predated the establishment of the crime of genocide 50 years ago .
