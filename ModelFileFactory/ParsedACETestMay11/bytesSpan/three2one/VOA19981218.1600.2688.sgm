174 310 Right now let us go to the well of the House of Representatives where Representative Dennis Kasich from Ohio a Democrat is now speaking .
311 376 spkr : Dennis_Kasich and this nation with a low rent impeachment .
377 442 There is much misunderstanding about just what impeachment means .
443 471 It is not a form of censure .
472 504 Impeachment is not a punishment .
505 554 It is part of a process for removing a president .
555 616 It has been reserved for the highest crimes , not low crimes .
617 797 I submit if we are to impeach President Clinton for his offenses , we will have committed an offense more grievous because we will have nullified the votes of 97 million Americans .
798 835 Do n't take away the people 's voice .
836 872 Do n't nullify the people 's choice .
873 983 Punish the President with censure if you must , but do n't punish the American people by canceling their vote .
984 1062 Someday a generation far into the future will look at this moment and ask why .
1063 1355 They will conclude that in impeaching a president , this House chose partisanship under the rule of patriotism and sanctimonious salutations to that all hallowed and selectively perceived rule of law and that cloak of shame prepared for the President will also cover those carrying the cloak .
1356 1403 For this moment , we are troubling our America .
1404 1437 We are troubling our common bond .
1438 1478 We are troubling our American community .
1479 1515 We are troubling our American unity .
1516 1636 The sun will rise and the year 2000 will soon come and those who have troubled their house will have inherited the wind .

1827 1866 spkr : Unknown Thank you , Mr. Speaker .
1867 2133 spkr : John_Olver Mr. Speaker , this is a totally prejudged and partisan process that denies the majority of the members of this House of Representatives and the majority of Americans a vote on a bipartisan compromise , a vote of conscience to censure the President .
2134 2324 Mr. Speaker , the American people in their collective electoral wisdom that we all ... spkr : Morales You are listening to debate coming to you from the well of the House of Representatives .
2325 2397 Debate on whether or not to impeach President William Jefferson Clinton .
2398 2476 The first time an impeachment of a president would have happened in 130 years .
2477 2565 Right now we are listening to Representative John Olver , a Democrat from Massachusetts .
2566 2606 spkr : Olver no grounds for impeachment .
2607 2649 No such thing appears in the Starr Report .
2650 2911 Instead I found evidence gathered at great public cost in dollars , $ 50 million , and in destruction of privacy that Americans cherish evidence of a consensual sexual relationship of the tawdriest nature which the participants tried to hide for its tawdriness .
2912 3035 Weeks of Judiciary Committee hearings have uncovered nothing more except the partisan closed mindedness of the proceedings .
3036 3216 The Republicans obsession to impeach President Clinton on the flimsiest of constitution grounds and against the will of most Americans will cause long lasting divisions in America .
3217 3455 The Republicans know that they can not get 67 votes in the Senate to remove the President from office , so this is a purely partisan exercise in this House designed to humiliate and weaken the twice elected President of the United States .
3456 3499 Fifteen seconds more please , Mr. Chairman .
3500 3573 spkr : Unknown I am pleased to grant the gentleman 15 additional seconds .
3574 3780 spkr : Olver To my Republican colleagues , by your efforts today you show the American people once and for all that you should not be in the majority in this Congress and that I believe will be your reward .
