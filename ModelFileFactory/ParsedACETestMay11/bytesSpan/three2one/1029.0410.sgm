311 533 Shooting a brilliant seven-under-par 63 on a challenging East Lake Golf Club course where only nine players broke par , Singh soared to a three-stroke lead over Billy Mayfair after the first round of the Tour Championship .
534 724 It was a machine-like display of ball-striking by Singh , this year 's P.G.A. Champion , who missed only one fairway and putted with precision on lightning-fast greens that invited mistakes .
725 925 Singh 's round was the best competitive round in East Lake 's history , and it also matched the lowest round in Tour Championship history , equaled by Wayne Levi in 1989 and Jim Gallagher Jr. in 1993 .
926 1112 Tommy Barnes holds the course record -LRB- 62 -RRB- at East Lake , but the legendary Bobby Jones , who learned to play golf at East Lake , never shot better than a 63 on his home course .
1113 1210 Regardless of what club Singh held in his hands today , he felt confident of hitting a good shot .
1211 1235 Singh made it look easy .
1236 1254 But it was n't . ''
1255 1382 Unbelievable , '' said Singh , whose round included eight birdies and one bogey as he avoided the treacherous Bermuda rough . ''
1383 1431 I hit the ball probably the best I did all year .
1432 1474 I drove the ball really long and straight .
1475 1520 The longest iron I hit today was a 6-iron . ''
1521 1588 Today was an exceptional round for anybody to shoot 63 around here .
1589 1632 I think the longest putt I had was 18 feet .
1633 1698 It 's one of the best rounds I 've ever had from tee to green . ''
1699 1875 Nobody could keep pace with Singh today , but with three rounds remaining on a course this difficult , most players in the elite 30-man field remained within striking distance .
1876 1995 Mayfair 's 66 left him alone in second place , while Tom Lehman and Jim Furyk -LRB- 67 -RRB- were tied for third place .
1996 2129 Meanwhile , the competition for the money title and PGA Tour player of the year honors could get interesting before the weekend ends .
2130 2219 David Duval can clinch the money title simply by finishing alone in 24th place or better .
2220 2305 But Duval struggled to a 75 today , leaving him tied for 28th place with Tiger Woods .
2306 2421 If Duval finishes lower than 24th , and if Furyk wins the tournament , Furyk can snatch the money title from Duval .
2422 2574 And Duval is battling Mark O'Meara for player of the year honors , but O'Meara did not have a sparkling round today either , shooting a one-over-par 71 .
2575 2714 The scores of Duval and Woods , neither of whom had a birdie , showed how difficult East Lake is , but Singh was almost too good to notice .
2715 2814 He shot a five-under-par 30 on the front nine , using his accuracy to set up makeable birdie putts .
2815 2889 At No. 1 , Singh hit a 9-iron approach shot to within six feet of the cup .
2890 2938 At No. 3 , he hit a sand wedge to within a foot .
2939 2986 At No. 5 , he hit another 9-iron to eight feet .
2987 3032 At No. 8 , he hit a pitching wedge to a foot .
3033 3198 Singh made all of those ensuing short putts for birdie , then at No. 9 , he made an 18-foot birdie putt , just in case anyone felt that he could not make a long one .
3199 3244 Singh 's momentum continued on the back nine .
3245 3331 He birdied No. 11 , hitting a 7-iron approach shot to six feet , then making the putt .
3332 3430 On No. 13 , his birdie was set up by a sand wedge approach shot that stopped a foot from the hole .
3431 3565 Then Singh reached eight under par when he birdied the par-5 No. 15 , reaching the green in two shots , then two-putting from 25 feet .
3566 3673 The only blemish on Singh 's card came at the par-3 No. 18 , when he bogeyed by three-putting from 40 feet .
3674 3717 But it did not spoil his day , or his year .
3718 3892 Despite all the talk about Duval and O'Meara , Singh is third on the money list , and he has won two tournaments -LRB- the P.G.A. Championship and Sprint International -RRB- .
3893 4089 If Singh were to take home the $ 720,000 first-place check , he would finish No. 2 on the money list , and he would have more victories on tour this year than anyone except Duval -LRB- four -RRB- .
4090 4165 Singh entered this week somewhat overshadowed , but he was not after today .
4166 4236 Most of Singh 's gallery came to see Woods , Singh 's playing partner .
4237 4326 But while people may have arrived talking about Woods , they left talking about Singh . ''
4327 4503 My whole game is getting better , '' said Singh , a 35-year-old native of Fiji , who lives in Ponte Vedra Beach , Fla. '' But I was never expecting to shoot anything like that .
4504 4597 I just said , ` Make sure you play solid , shoot a good number , do n't shoot yourself out . '
4598 4634 It turned out really good for me . ''
4635 4635 .
