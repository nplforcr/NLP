 Good evening. We begin tonight with one of those events in the category of
 things we thought we might never see. We remembered today that after the
 Berlin Wall came down, after South Africa became a democracy and even the
 Arabs and Israelis had shaken hands, an end to what they call the
 troubles in Northern Ireland seemed remote at best. The troubles may not
 be completely over, but they did make history in Belfast today.

 At Stormont Castle today, Catholics, including representatives of the Irish
 Republican Army and their Protestant adversaries, have agreed to make peace
 after three decades of violence that took more than three thousand lives. The
 former US Senator George Mitchell led the negotiations.

<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="120.641" endTime="134.729">
 It doesn't take courage to shoot a policeman in the back of the head or to
 murder an unarmed taxi driver. What takes courage is to compete in the
 arena of democracy.

<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="134.729" endTime="187.145">
 Northern Ireland has been part of Great Britain since nineteen twenty-one. Under today's
 deal, it will be governed, at least in part, by an elected Northern Ireland
 Assembly in which Catholics and Protestants will share power, and a North South
 Council, meaning more cooperation between the North and the Republic of
 Ireland, the country to the south.
 A lot remains to be settled. The Catholic minority wants these to
 be strong institutions, to guarantee the rights they feel that they have
 been denied. The Protestants want the institutions to be weak. They
 believe that their interests are best served the more power that Great
 Britain retains.
 No one, of course, discounts the chance that extremists on both sides will
 use violence again. So the question is, will the agreement stick? Will
 this really be remembered as the day that peace came to Northern Ireland?
 In Belfast tonight, ABC's Jim Wooten.

 If Belfast's ordinary folks seemed slightly less than jubilant today,
 certainly less excited than their newspapers.

<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="194.939" endTime="198.867">
 Whether it comes through or not is a is a debatable point.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="198.867" endTime="203.069">
 Do I feel hopeful? No. I I can't quite honestly say that I do.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="203.069" endTime="207.804">
 Maybe they've learned from their yesterdays not to expect too much from
 their tomorrows.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="211.031" endTime="221.586">
 There were Good Friday prayers for peace, of course, from Protestants and
 Catholics too. Such good people of such deep faith, it's hard to believe their
 past is so savage.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="223.237" endTime="230.359">
 It's hard to forget, much less to forgive. Seven thousand
 people have seen a member of their immediate family killed.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="230.359" endTime="234.611">
 I mean, we've had too much. They hadn't known life at all.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="236.220" endTime="239.769">
 So at the White Fork Pub today, the cheers were mainly for soccer,

<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="241.031" endTime="243.468">
 not the promise of peace because
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="243.468" endTime="247.985">
 There's always going to be a small minority of people who will always want
 to keep the pot boiling.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="247.985" endTime="265.627">
 Even though the mainstream Protestant and Catholic groups are parties to
 this agreement, a handful of killers could still wreck it. That's what
 happened in nineteen seventy-four when a similar power sharing arrangement, without Sinn
 Fein and the IRA, was attacked by Protestant hardliners.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="265.627" endTime="269.666">
 God help those ladies and gentlemen who get in our way.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="269.666" endTime="289.456">
 And replaced with years of violence today's agreement is meant to stop.
 The people of Northern Ireland will have to approve it, of course, in a
 referendum. And with a Protestant majority, that is no sure thing, which
 may help to explain the absence of joy on the streets of this city today.
 They have, after all, been here before.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="289.456" endTime="293.069">
 I just pray to God that we can all live together.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="293.069" endTime="298.532">
 Maybe, maybe they will. Jim Wooten, ABC News, Belfast.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="298.532" endTime="311.147">
 The negotiations lasted twenty-two months. In the last session, thirty-two straight hours. The man in charge of it all, the newsmaker here, was an American, former
 Senator George Mitchell of Maine.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="311.147" endTime="312.806">
 You want me to sit? All right.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="312.806" endTime="351.645">
 Don't be deceived by his owlish appearance, say his friends. The man is
 very determined. George Mitchell left the Senate three years ago because he
 found it unsatisfying. There was talk about being baseball commissioner,
 but the British prime minister knew his reputation as a master of
 compromise. That and an Irish connection, Mitchell's father is Irish,
 his mother Lebanese, soon landed him in the toughest imaginable negotiations. These talks between Protestants and Catholics were often so
 contentious that one participant said he thought Mitchell might pack it in
 and go back to America. For his part, he says he has never met nicer
 people in the world.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="351.645" endTime="363.313">
 I have this absolute belief that everyone who has benefited has an
 obligation to do for others if that chance arises.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="363.313" endTime="380.34">
 But he can come home now, this sixty-four year old man from Maine. His young wife
 and a brand new baby boy are waiting.
 The deal that Senator Mitchell has so successfully put together will be put
 to a vote in Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic next month.
