 There has been endless speculation here today about how the President, not his speech, but Mr. Clinton himself, will be received on Capitol Hill tonight. Here are some clues.
</turn>
<turn speaker="spkr_6" spkrtype="male" startTime="1558.191" endTime="1562.369">
 Mr. Speaker, the President of the United States.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Peter_Jennings" spkrtype="male" startTime="1562.369" endTime="1585.374">
 In the first few minutes after the President arrives in the chamber, you can begin to judge the political temperature. Are senators and representatives eager to greet him, shake his hand, touch him?
<time sec="1573.922">
 Republicans and Democrats are very aware that the country will be watching them carefully. As an occasion, this is meant to be a celebration of the American democratic system.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Michael_Beschloss" spkrtype="male" startTime="1585.374" endTime="1590.313">
 This is one of the few ceremonies that, at least in theory, should bring us all together.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Peter_Jennings" spkrtype="male" startTime="1590.313" endTime="1593.600">
 The Republican Speaker of the House, Mr. Gingrich
</turn>
<turn speaker="Newt_Gingrich" spkrtype="male" startTime="1593.600" endTime="1599.514">
 The President of the United States will be an honored guest to the House and Senate.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Peter_Jennings" spkrtype="male" startTime="1599.514" endTime="1621.942">
 So the country will be looking very closely. But in all likelihood tonight, the President will be received correctly.
<time sec="1607.130">
 So just before we leave to prepare for the State of the Union, a couple of other questions for Sam Donaldson and Cokie Roberts, who's in the bureau this evening. Cokie, I talked to a senior Democrat up there today, and I said, Do you believe the President? He said, I believe him today, emphatically, he said. Is that about the mood?
</turn>
<turn speaker="Cokie_Roberts" spkrtype="female" startTime="1621.942" endTime="1656.572">
 That's about the best you'll get. uh Even the people speaking on the record and for microphones uh would uh not defend the President. They said things like, well, you should give him the benefit of the doubt. uh And of course, off the record and not in the microphones, they're saying far more damaging things. 
<time sec="1638.770">
 But you can't count on this scene tonight telling you anything, Peter. I remember right before Jim Wright had to leave as Speaker of the House, when members were telling us in the press, he's got to go. He's got to get out of here. He went to a Democratic caucus, and they gave him a big cheer and a standing ovation. These are not the most straightforward people.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Peter_Jennings" spkrtype="male" startTime="1656.572" endTime="1663.768">
 So I think you're saying that for those people around the country, us included, who are looking for these clues, it's going to look wired and respectful as always?
</turn>
<turn speaker="Cokie_Roberts" spkrtype="female" startTime="1663.768" endTime="1669.934">
 I think that's absolutely right. I'd be amazed if it doesn't. But sometimes something happens that changes that, but it would surprise me.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Peter_Jennings" spkrtype="male" startTime="1669.934" endTime="1680.047">
 Okay, let's go to Sam Donaldson at the White House. Sam, other than the President's appearance at church the other day, this is his first big public appearance since he became enveloped in this. Do you think he's nervous?
</turn>
<turn speaker="Sam_Donaldson" spkrtype="male" startTime="1680.047" endTime="1703.623">
 I think he is probably nervous. But you can always count on Bill Clinton in a clutch to deliver a speech well. There's no doubt about that. It's interesting. Aides have gone over every line of this speech
<time sec="1689.528">
 to make certain there's no double entendre in it, some innocent phrase that in normal times no one would pay attention to, but the country tonight would go hee, hee, hee, hee. 
<time sec="1698.180">
 So the speech may be eloquent, but it is not going to be anything that's other than squeaky clean.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Peter_Jennings" spkrtype="male" startTime="1703.623" endTime="1727.328">
 Okay, thanks, both of you very much. Sam and Cokie, looking forward to talking to you later. By the way, the Republican response tonight is going to be given by 
<time sec="1709.923">
 Senator Trent Lott. He did remove a couple of words that he thought might be misinterpreted. We hope you'll join us for our coverage of the Presidents State of the Union address live from Capitol Hill nine o'clock eastern time. I'm Peter Jennings. That's World News Tonight for tonight. Have a good evening, and good night from Washington.
