 It was a grim day at Air France terminals today with some ninety-five percent of
 the French national carrier's pilots on strike. Negotiations are set to
 reopen tomorrow in an effort to avert a chaotic start to the World Cup
 soccer tournament. Sarah Chaise reports from Paris.

 Most of the hundred thousand passengers who would have flown Air France
 today were aware of the strike and made alternate plans. Strikes are a fact
 of life here, though this one is particularly ill timed. Some two million
 soccer fans are expected to inundate the country starting next week. The
 Air France conflict is over a management demand that the pilots take a
 fifteen percent pay cut in return for stock, and over the extension of a
 lower pay scale for new hirees that was supposed to be phased out
 yesterday. Today the president of Air France said he'll consider the
 pilots' proposal for a time limit on the fifteen percent pay
 cut. Negotiations are set to open tomorrow. For NPR news, I'm Sarah
 Chaise in Paris.
