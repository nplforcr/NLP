 Finally from us this evening, gold for the women. There has never been a
 women's hockey before gold medal before. At first, the American women were not
 expected to do very well. And then they got rolling. Here's ABC's Jon
 Frankel.

 In Nagano, it was a great day to be an American woman.

<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1632.757" endTime="1634.122">
 Yes we're making history right now.

 The US women opened the scoring against heavily favored Canada and never
 looked back.

<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1640.908" endTime="1643.156">
 A centering pass and a goal.

<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1643.156" endTime="1645.614">
 In the third period, two nothing.

 and the empty net Goal.

 And when it was over, there was a moment at center ice which reminded so
 many of another Olympics, Lake Placid in nineteen eighty and another team USA.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1658.765" endTime="1666.286">
 You know, it's it's it is, it's bizarre because you watched it so many times as a
 kid.
 and um you know, that's th- the way we feel right now.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1666.286" endTime="1677.105">
 And that's the way they were feeling in America today, in places such as
 Providence, Rhode Island, where they watched it all this morning and tried
 to imagine where women's hockey goes next.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1677.105" endTime="1681.349">
 It's one of those things, that's like Mom, I want to do that, and I want
 to be there.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1681.349" endTime="1692.442">
 In nineteen ninety, five thousand women were registered with US hockey. Today, almost twenty four thousand
 are playing the game. And a gold medal can only make this sport grow.

<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1692.442" endTime="1699.143">
 Winning the gold at Nagano gives all the little girls out there who idolize
 Cammi Granato or Carrie Bye it gives them a new goal to shoot for.

<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1699.143" endTime="1724.159">
 The Olympics were once the end of the road for women in sports. There were
 no professional leagues for them to move on to.
 But women in hockey note the Olympics helped women basketball players get a
 league of their own, and they want one, too. Six of these gold medalists
 hope to play pro hockey in a new women's league next fall. Whatever its
 fate, if there was ever a day to contemplate professional women's hockey,
 today was the day.
