 There have been more arrests in Nigeria following violent anti-government
 protests several weeks ago.
 Among the latest is prominent civil rights lawyer Alissa Abadcova, leader
 of the Lagos based civil liberties organization.
 Correspondent Purnell Murdock reports the arrests have
 sparked fresh criticism of military ruler Sani Abacha's human rights
 record.

 Human Rights Watch, a US based human rights organization, says Alissa
 Abadcova is being held in detention under deplorable conditions.
 The organization says he has been denied access to his family and legal
 representation.
 Human Rights Watch says he is being held in solitary confinement and has
 begun a hunger strike to improve his conditions.
 Mr. Abadcova was arrested by Nigeria state security service on May eighth as he was
 returning from a trip to Ghana.
 No reason was given for his arrest.
 Members of Mi- Badcova's civil liberties organization say five more members were
 arrested on Monday.
 They say security forces seized records and equipment from the Lagos' offices.
 Human Rights Watch says the arrests of Mr. Abadcova and his associates fits
 a pattern of harassment of human rights activists aimed at preventing them
 from exercising their right to free speech guaranteed under international law
 and the Nigerian constitution.
