 The start of the new millennium could bring computer chaos around the world.
 Without major adjustments, most systems will not be able to enter the new
 century because their internal clocks will run out.
 VOA's Paula Wolfson reports computer experts say there is no easy fix and they are
 warning the US Congress that time is slipping away.

 The twentieth century will probably go down in history as the computer age.
 We've gone from crude adding machines to systems capable of sending data
 across the street or around the world in the blink of an eye.
 But trouble looms in the year two thousand.
 The computers of the twentieth century are not ready for the new millennium.
 They read the current year by using the last two digits only.
 They will not be able to cope when they read the year two thousand, seeing it instead
 as nineteen hundred.
 It seemed like a simple problem, one that could be easily fixed by upgraded software
 but experts say it is extraordinarily complex and the public is in denial.

 A large segment of the population is waiting for Bill Gates and Microsoft
 to release MS two thousand, the millennium virus fixer.
 There is no millennium virus fixer.

 Alan Simpson has been involved for years in the creation of global
 communications networks.
 He says Americans must realize the threat posed by the so called millennium bug is
 very real and very serious.

<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="859.100" endTime="876.811">
 We're not an island insulated from the telecommunications problems of the
 rest of the world.
 We trade, we communicate, and we point nuclear missiles at each other.
 The potential for catastrophic miscommunication in two thousand is immense.

<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="876.811" endTime="916.341">
 If nothing is done, people will wake up on the first day of the new
 millennium and find computer related services at a standstill.
 Air traffic will come to a sudden halt, banking and stock market activities will
 cease, and international communications links will shut down.
 The possibilities are enormous.
 The Clinton Administration predicts it will cost five billion dollars just to fix
 US government computer systems but critics charge the Administration's
 efforts are way behind schedule.
 California Republican Steve Horn is Chairman of a House Subcommittee concerned
 with the year two thousand computer problem.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="916.341" endTime="925.994">
 There's not enough time to do everything.
 There are too many problems contending for top priority.
 We must be careful in the selection of the most important problems.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="925.994" endTime="962.156">
 Mr. Horn predicts Congress will have to approve billions in emergency
 spending to get the job done.
 But even if the United States completes its computer adjustments on time, America
 cannot be complacent.
 It's an interdependent world warn the experts and many other countries have not
 even begun to deal with the millennium bug.
 Dan Steinberg is a lawyer involved with international technology issues.
 He says most of the information on the year two thousand computer crisis is published
 and disseminated in English, creating problems for many developing nations.

 They also have less money.
 This comes as no surprise.
 We give foreign aid to most of the world.
 It should be no surprise that those without sufficient funds, we're worried
 about funding right here in town, they can not solve their problems quickly enough.

<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="976.454" endTime="992.572">
 When the World Bank sent out a letter asking countries for information
 about their plans to deal with the millennium bug, many never replied.
 Telecommunications specialist Alan Simpson says the United States must take
 the lead on this issue at home and abroad.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="992.572" endTime="1005.797">
 We must create from strong leadership an environment that the problems can
 and will be fixed.
 It is this type of environment that this country was able to mobilize its enormous
 resources and prepare for World War two.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1005.797" endTime="1022.94">
 Mr. Simpson warns if international computer chaos occurs, the United States
 will be blamed.
 He says governments around the world will point to their American design
 technology and say, it's all your fault.
