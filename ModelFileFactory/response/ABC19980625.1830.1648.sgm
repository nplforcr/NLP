 A Last Word tonight about an extraordinary flower.
 It is the very rare titum arum really rare. This one, which grew to
 four foot eleven in less than three weeks, is only the sixth to bloom in the United
 States this century. It may be a good thing there aren't too many. The
 flower has a powerful stench. But it is a superstar.
 In nineteen thirty seven, when a titum arum bloomed at New York's botanical garden,
 it was such a spectacular event, they made it the official flower of the
 Bronx, which was then New York's fastest growing borough. Stamina is
 another matter.
 This one got to full bloom only today, and it may collapse tomorrow.
