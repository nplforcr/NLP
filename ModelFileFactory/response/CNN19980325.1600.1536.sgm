 The man at the helm of Titanic is setting records of his own.
 James Cameron won three statuettes at the Academy Awards on Monday.
 Dennis Michael talked with him about what makes Titanic sail.

 I'm the king of the world.

 James Cameron may not be a world ruler, but his crown as the reigning king
 of Hollywood is pretty secure following Monday night's Oscar gala.
 He came home with three personal Oscars for editing, for best director and,
 of course, best picture, something that has never happened before in Oscar
 history.
 Hollywood's King James the first still finds his position at the pinnacle
 something of a surprise.

 There's a certain aspect of how the hell did this happen? You know, um because i- it
 sort
 of uh goes against everything you think you know.
 uh Not that I didn't believe in the picture, I did.
 But I- I certainly never thought that it would enter these, you know, higher strata.
 uh And I don't think anyone did, quite frankly.
 I mean, we thought you know, we'll break even, make a little money, and we'll have felt
 good, very worthwhile doing it, but nothing like this.

 For Titanic, it was a virtual parade of winners Monday night.
 The film's art direction, costumes, sound and sound effects, music and song
 were all honored, as were the heroic visual effects.
 But Cameron says no single element, even his script or direction, is
 responsible for Titanic's success.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1609.708" endTime="1634.109">
 It's greater than the sum of the parts.
 The spectacle alone would not do it.
 The love story alone would not do it.
 A love story, as separated from Titanic, would not have been a- as powerful.
 A Titanic story without the love story to give you an investment in it
 would not have been as powerful.
 But you put it all together and it's doing something u- t- clearly to the hearts of
 audiences in all cultures, you know, everywhere.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1637.541" endTime="1647.896">
 It's a chemistry of the elements.
 And if you take one thing away, there's a diminishment.
 You take another thing away, there's a diminishment.
 You put them all together, and you achieve an effect that's, you could call
 it a synergistic effect.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1647.896" endTime="1661.932">
 And Cameron's acceptance speech at Monday night's academy awards may have
 been a first.
 He asked for a moment of silence to remember the souls lost aboard the real
 Titanic in nineteen twelve.
 But an awareness of the reality of the tragedy has always been at the heart
 of the effort to bring Titanic to the screen.

<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1661.932" endTime="1682.555">
 The film does, you know, uh try to embrace a kind of uh a kind of noble spirit.
 And that that's a lot of what is intriguing about Titanic as a, as a subject, and I, uh,
 you know, y- you want to try to live up to that.
 And I think that that's a lot of what was going on during the making of the
 film, too, for the, for the crew, for the people involved. We were all trying to live up to the the subject.

 Oscar night caps a titanic achievement for James Cameron.
