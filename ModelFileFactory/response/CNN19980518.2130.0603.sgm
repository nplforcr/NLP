 New York Yankee fans are celebrating perfection.
 Pitcher David Wells threw a perfect game against the Minnesota Twins
 yesterday.
 Gary Tuchman reports, Wells is sometimes better known for his off the field
 antics than his athletic ability.

 Inside the New York Yankee souvenir stores in New York City, there are
 jerseys of Yankee legends like Ruth and Gehrig, and current Yankee stars
 like Knoblauch, Cone, and Williams.
 But the stores don't regularly carry the jersey of the man who just made baseball
 history.

<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="638.926" endTime="651.628">
 David Wells is the fifteenth pitcher in nearly one hundred thirty
 years of major league baseball to get a perfect game, which means
 none of the twenty-seven batters he faced reached first base.
 A remarkable sporting feat by a man who grew up a Yankee fan.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="651.628" endTime="660.294">
 You know it's just something that, ah, you know you have to cherish this.
 And, eh- it really hasn't sunk in, because I'm still nervous.
 I'm still shaking.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="660.294" endTime="685.187">
 Coincidentally, Wells went to the same California high school as the only
 other Yankee pitcher to hurl a perfect game.
 That was Don Larsen, who did it during the nineteen fifty-six World Series against the
 Brooklyn Dodgers.
 Wells, who will turn thirty-five this week, is considered a good pitcher.
 But perfect is not a word used to describe a man who has a history of being
 a bit rebellious and, to put it kindly, a bit portly.
 But those facts make him more of a hero for many fans.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="685.187" endTime="691.214">
 He's sort of unusual looking guy for a pitcher, isn't he?
 But, ah, he can come up with the goods.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="691.214" endTime="700.536">
 I think the fact that he just shows you that a party kind of guy can go out, you know,
 maybe the night before, doing whatever he's doing, and come the next day and
 pitch a no hitter, a perfect game.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="700.536" endTime="706.494">
 He's had his fights in the past with the boss, Yankee owner George
 Steinbrenner, but Wells says he is who he is.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="706.494" endTime="715.095">
 Sometimes I just don't give a crap what, you know, what people say an- and what they do.
 I just, you know, worry about my job and what I'm supposed to do.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="715.095" endTime="718.688">
 So is it time for the Yankee stores to reorder David Wells jerseys?
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="718.688" endTime="724.055">
 Oh yes, definitely.
 We've already had a lot of questions for David Wells merchandise today.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="724.055" endTime="742.50">
 In the meantime, all the stores' TV monitors are providing perfect game
 replays.
 A perfect game is an incredibly rare feat.
 But by virtue of pitching one, David Wells now has the chance to do something
 even rarer, back-to-back perfect games.
 That has never happened.
