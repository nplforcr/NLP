 But with two horrible accidents within a week involving two American
 personalities, a lot of people have wondered whether skiing is more
 dangerous than people think. Those of us who ski would say, sure, there's
 an element of risk, like much of life. But dangerous? No more than
 anything else.
 About the same number of people die on America's ski slopes every
 year, between thirty and thirty-five. Three times as many people are killed by
 lightning every year. And in nineteen ninety-five alone, eight hundred
 people died in bicycle accidents and seven hundred in accidents involving
 boats.
 Of the skiers who die, eighty-five percent are young men, teenagers or in
 their twenties. The same group most likely to die because of reckless driving.
 As for skiing injuries. They have actually gone down in the last twenty-five
 years by about fifty percent. That is primarily because of better equipment.
 As for wearing a helmet, many small children and racers certainly
 do, but the vast majority of skiers do not. Helmet sales, we are told,
 have gone up since Michael Kennedy was killed.
