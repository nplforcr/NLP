 A very big piece of history will be traveling this long holiday weekend,
 too.
 The battleship USS Missouri begins what is expected to be a month long
 journey from the Pacific northwest to Hawaii.
 Japan formally surrendered to the United States on the Missouri's decks in
 nineteen forty-five, ending World War Two.
 The Missouri will come to rest near the memorial for the USS Arizona,
 which was sunk by the Japanese during the attack on Pearl Harbor.
