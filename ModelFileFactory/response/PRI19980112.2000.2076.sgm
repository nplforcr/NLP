 This is The World, a co-production of the BBC world Service, Public Radio
 International, and WGBH Boston. I'm Eddie Mair in London.

<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="2084.193" endTime="2097.512">
 And I'm Tony Kahn in Boston. As a British negotiator to the northern
 Ireland peace talks put it today, the clock is ticking. As the violence there
 increases, politicians have resumed the search for peace in the British-ruled
 province.
</turn>

 When the negotiators ended their previous meeting a month ago, they hadn't
 even agreed on an agenda. But today the British and Irish governments,
 which co-sponsored the talks, presented a proposal setting priorities.
 The suggestions have been made before but the plan, if accepted, would clear
 the first hurdle on the course to a peace settlement for northern Ireland.
 In Belfast, the BBC's Tom Coulter has been following the day's events and
 assesses the proposals.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="2124.109" endTime="2182.197">
 Well the main thrust of the proposals are tha- that, first of all, there will be
 discussion and negotiation about Constitutional change. Now, that will take
 in the Irish government's a- articles two and three of their constitution, which
 lays claim to jurisdiction over northern Ireland, but it also brings in the
 UK government's ah government of Ireland act
<time sec="2143.783">
 which actually partitioned northern Ireland from the rest of the island back in the
 twenties, so all things are there are up for grabs an- and for negotiation. There's also
 a new intergovernmental tier being implemented. uh It will
 address the
 totality of relations between the two islands
<time sec="2161.094">
 and certainly it would bring in the new uh Scottish Parliament which
 is to be, to be formed, the new Welsh assembly which is also to, to be elected
 and also th- m- a northern Ireland assembly which will be uh voted for on proportional
 representation grounds and then the two sovereign governments. So it will be an
 umbrella body which will oversee the totality of relationships between the
 two islands.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="2182.197" endTime="2193.300">
 Tom, is there enough here to keep the nationalists happy, those people who
 want a united Ireland, but also to appease the Unionists, the people who
 want to remain part of the United Kingdom? Two positions which appear to be
 irreconcilable.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="2193.300" endTime="2259.592">
 Well, they would seem to be to most outsiders and certainly with the
 constitutional change as put forward, or the a possibility of constitutional
 change. That wi- will pro- provide difficulties for all sides because obviously the
 unionists, as you say, want to s-, they are pro-British, they want to
 remain part of the United Kingdom. The republicans want a united Ireland.
<time sec="2211.451">
 But that's there on the table. Everything is on the table. They can negotiate it. And
 I suppose at the end of the day it's what consent is agreed and I suppose
 there are elements within John Hume's SDLP who perhaps ar- are looking in a
 longer term, don't expect to see a united Ireland in the short term.
<time sec="2228.184">
 They would be quite happy with the north south cross border bodies which will have
 some powers, obviously, and an- an overview of the situation within the island of
 Ireland. So that may be enough to keep most people on board. Certainly the
 reaction I have been getting uh just talking to the various parties is that
 there are ele- elements in this that they like, there are others they're not so
 happy with,
<time sec="2248.100">
 but really at the end of the day I think now people are going to
 have to face some unpalatable, hard facts about how northern Ireland's
 future is going to be mapped out and that's what they're going to have to address
 in the coming weeks and months.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="2259.592" endTime="2267.691">
 Is this document, released today by the British and Irish Governments, does
 it look like it is the basis for an agreement?
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="2267.691" endTime="2317.701">
 Well, certainly th- the Irish government have described it as a road map, um uh a way
 forward for people. uh th- uh the British government have described it, say it's not
 set in tablets of stone but it is a way where we can progress these talks
 because most pa- parties' complaint here has been that they're not really addressing
 the core issues and haven't been since the talks started in September.
<time sec="2289.046">
 But neither are getting down to the core issues. Whether agreement can be reached,
 let's be honest about it. This is a- a been a problem that's been running now for
 not only thirty years of violence in northern Ireland but certainly for the last
 seventy years, so it's going to be a very difficult problem to resolve. But I think
 what the governments are hoping for is that th- if there is the good will and the
 desire and the willingness to compromise on all sides, then, yes, there is a basis
 for agreement and for a solution to the problems that uh b- bedeviled this
 province for, for so many years.
