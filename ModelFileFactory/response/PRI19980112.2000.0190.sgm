 The UN's chief weapons inspector says his monitoring teams will go ahead
 with their work as planned despite Iraq's threat to block a team led by an
 American. Iraqi officials claim team leader Scott Ritter, an American, is a

 Ritter, a former Marine captain who served in the Persian Gulf War, denies the
 charge.
