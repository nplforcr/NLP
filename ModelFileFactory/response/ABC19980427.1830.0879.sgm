 In Pennsylvania today, and it's become a reasonably familiar scene,
 hugs and tears as students returned to class after a fourteen year old boy
 shot and killed a teacher at a graduation dance on Friday night.
<time sec="885.355">
 And in North Carolina, where a four year old boy accidentally shot and killed
 a six year old playmate over the weekend, the shooter's grandmother was charged
 today with failing to store the weapon safely.
 In both cases, the guns belonged to adults. And there is growing
 pressure to hold adults responsible when kids with guns cause harm. Here's
 ABC's legal correspondent Terry Moran.

 Paducah, Jonesboro, Edinboro, whether it's intentional or accidental,
 whether the victims are other children or adults, when American kids pick
 up guns, the results are often horrifying.

 And I, and I shot her. I didn't mean to. She's dead.

 She's dead?

 Yes. Please get my mom and dad. Oh, my God.

 One increasingly popular response, blame the adults. Over the past decade,
 fifteen states have passed laws which hold gun owners criminally responsible
 when a child uses the adult's gun and injures someone.
<time sec="952.661">
 A recent study published in the Journal of the American Medical
 Association found that in twelve states which hold adults responsible for
 wayward guns, unintentional shooting deaths among children under fifteen were
 down twenty-three percent. Doctor Frederick Rivara is co-author of the study.

 This law doesn't say anything about whether or not people should ow- own guns
 in
 their home. It really tries to avoid that whole very emotional political
 topic. But instead, says if you have a gun in the home, we want you to
 store it safely.

 The NRA opposes most gun access laws, arguing that educating children, not
 punishing grieving parents is the answer.

 If you're talking about putting parents on notice if they do something
 incredibly stupid, that they can be held criminal responsible for
 negligence, they they already can be held criminally negligent.

 Whether it is tougher laws or better gun education, everyone agrees more
 needs to be done. For American children are still twelve times more likely to
 die by firearms than children in the other twenty-five industrialized nations
 combined. Terry Moran, ABC News, New York.
