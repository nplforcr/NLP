 South Korea's government says it has achieved success in efforts to
 reschedule twenty four billion dollars in short term foreign debt. A
 finance ministry official told reporters in Seoul Monday that almost ninety

 collection of their loans. Last month, South Korean officials began
 visiting creditors in several cities, including New York, London, Tokyo and
 Hong Kong, seeking agreements to reschedule.
