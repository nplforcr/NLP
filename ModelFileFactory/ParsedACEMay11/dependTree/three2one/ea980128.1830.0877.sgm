And if they 're required to be people telling confidences of the president , I think that confidence and that relationship is going to be undermined immeasurably .

Let me take up the other side , though , because it came up with the Secret Service agents looking after John F Kennedy .

They are law enforcement officers .

What if they are witness or become aware that the law has been broken ?

But that is less the issue when , for example , they might know , at the moment , this is all hypothetical .

What should they do ?

I mean , if we follow this to its logical conclusion , the independent counsel should be able to subpoena every Secret Service agent who 's ever protected the president at any point in time to see whether they heard or did n't hear or saw or did n't see something .
