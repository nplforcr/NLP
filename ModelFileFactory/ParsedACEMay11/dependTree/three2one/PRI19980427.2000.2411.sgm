But the reason why it 's also being regarded as dissatisfactory is that it 's a very paltry sum involved , much less than the women were actually asking for .

On the one hand , there 's a growing body of people who think Japan should face up to its past .

But there 's still a very influential group of people who believe that Japan acted in a completely justifiable way given that uh - it was a time of war .
