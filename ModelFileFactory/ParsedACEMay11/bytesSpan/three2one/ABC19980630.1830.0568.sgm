0 178 ABC19980630 .1830.0568 NEWS STORY For all the attention we pay to the weather and to the climate , we ca n't do much about it , though the urge to do so is sometimes very strong .
179 204 Case in point California .
205 317 For years , Los Angeles has been getting half of its water from the Owens Valley , about two hundred miles away .
318 363 And the Owens Valley has never been the same .
364 393 ABC 's Jane Clayson is there .
394 596 A clear day can be deceiving in the Owens Valley , because when the wind rolls over this dried out lake bed , it whips up the worst air pollution in the country , a dust storm that turns this into this .
597 643 Air so dense you ca n't see across the street .
644 679 Forty thousand people are affected .
680 729 But the tiny town of Keeler gets the worst of it .
730 783 This is a blight on California that should not exist .
784 844 It 's like a big dust pile , a hundred square miles of dust .
845 876 I mean , you ca n't breathe it .
877 909 And if you breathe it , you die .
910 934 That 's no exaggeration .
935 1124 Three hundred thousand tons of naturally occurring toxic pollutants fly off the lake bed every dangerous contaminants that are , that are present in the soil are ah are cadmium and arsenic .
1125 1195 Owens Lake was once the center of a fertile farm and mining community .
1196 1364 But eighty-five years ago , the newly developing city of Los Angeles , some two hundred miles away , built an aqueduct to divert the Owens River , which fed Owens Lake .
1365 1481 The lake dried up , and the Owens Valley was stuck with the dust while the river water still flows to LA dirt cheap .
1482 1512 This is environmental justice .
1513 1645 It 's just wrong for the people of the Owens Valley to have their health harmed so the people in Los Angeles can pay less for water .
1646 1739 And so , Los Angeles is under intense pressure to put some of its water back into Owens Lake .
1740 1823 One plan would divert up to fifteen percent of the city 's water supply every year .
1824 1873 That may be too much for the big city to swallow .
1874 2013 But Los Angeles is offering to return some water which , along with gravel and vegetation planted on the lake bed , might control the dust .
2014 2076 We are not agreeing to go up there and just throw money at it .
2077 2156 We are willing to e - spend what it takes in effective measures to clean it up .
2157 2327 But nobody 's holding their breath , until the next dust storm , when the big city and the small town go at it again in one of the longest running water wars in the West .
