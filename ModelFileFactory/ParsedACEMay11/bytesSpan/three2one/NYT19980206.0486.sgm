Times News Service dLR ; dQC ; dQL ; The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday , Feb. 7 : When the subject turns to animals , most politicians turn irrational .
414 516 There is no better evidence than bills passed in Congress dramatically changing public housing policy .
517 615 Both House and Senate versions have an avowed aim of giving more control to the local authorities .
616 767 But on one issue , both chambers went in the opposite direction by stripping local housing administrators of the right to ban pets from their projects .
768 842 Large dogs bred for fighting have become a safety hazard in some projects .
843 1002 Even peaceable animals can turn playgrounds into health hazards or create misery for an entire floor of tenants by barking or using the hallways as a bathroom .
1003 1130 Animal advocates _ with a big assist from the pet food lobby _ say these problems should be dealt with on a case-by-case basis .
1131 1242 That might work well in smaller projects or where ferocious pit bulls are not high-testosterone status symbols .
1243 1349 But in New York City , where more than half a million people live in public housing , that approach fails .
1350 1447 Except in projects for the elderly , the New York City Housing Authority theoretically bans dogs .
1448 1609 But the authority actually follows a live-and-let-live policy unless building workers or neighbors complain that a family is keeping a dangerous or noisy animal .
1610 1696 Getting rid of those bad apples then becomes a long , difficult and expensive process .
1697 1875 The authority has had to initiate eviction proceedings against 300 families who refused to get rid of their animals until they were faced with immediate loss of their apartments .
1876 2012 The authority will never , and should never , waste its time and resources trying to weed out all the innocuous and beloved family dogs .
2013 2169 But the ban provides useful leverage against people who will not easily agree to get rid of a pet , no matter how miserable it makes life for the neighbors .
2170 2286 Empowering dog-owning families with a federal right will make it far more difficult for the authority to win a case .
2287 2330 This is an issue that is simple to rectify .
2331 2514 The legislators who created this mess , particularly Rep. Carolyn Maloney of New York , must encourage the conferees to kill the provision and refrain from bringing the idea up again .
2515 2566 Fighting the pet lobby will not win them any votes .
2567 2716 But it is the responsible thing to do _ the kind of small decision that shows the difference between a pandering politician and a serious legislator .
