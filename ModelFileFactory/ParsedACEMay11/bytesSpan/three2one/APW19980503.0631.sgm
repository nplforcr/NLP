360 430 Hussein said he has always accepted the opposition 's right to differ .
431 585 But at the same time `` the prevailing opinion should be that of the majority , and the opinion of the majority should be respected , '' the monarch said .
586 774 Hussein 's remarks in a ceremony marking the 45th anniversary of his accession to the throne underlined his frustration with mounting opposition to Jordan 's 1994 peace treaty with Israel .
775 933 With the Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations deadlocked , many in Jordan 's predominantly Palestinian population have became critical of peace with Israel .
934 1051 But in the absence of opinion polls , it is difficult to say how many Jordanians are for or against the peace treaty .
1052 1194 `` Opposition can be on a certain policy or position , but absolute opposition for the sake of opposition is not acceptable , '' Hussein said .
1195 1289 Instead , he said , there must be `` dialogue and consultations until we reach a consensus . ''
1290 1446 Jordan 's 13 hard-line political parties , espousing ideologies ranging from Muslim fundamentalism to communism , have no seats in the 80-member parliament .
1447 1535 Still , they wield considerable influence among the poor Palestinian refugees in Jordan .
1536 1661 Palestinians displaced in the 1948 and 1967 Arab-Israeli wars make up roughly two-thirds of Jordan 's 3.8 million population .
