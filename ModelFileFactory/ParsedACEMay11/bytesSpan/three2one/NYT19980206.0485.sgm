441 771 dLR ; dQL ; -LRB- lb -RRB- dQL ; dUR ; c. 1998 N.Y. Times News Service dLR ; dQC ; dQL ; WASHINGTON _ Following are excerpts from a letter to the independent counsel , Kenneth Starr , by President Clinton 's personal lawyer , David Kendall , as provided by Kendall : `` The leaking by your office has reached an intolerable point .
772 1034 The covert dissemination of both accurate and inaccurate information by your staff violates Rule 6 -LRB- e -RRB- of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedures , case law , Department of Justice guidelines , rules of court and well-established ethical prohibitions .
1035 1291 At your press conference yesterday , you paid lip service to your legal and ethical obligations , remarking that you could not respond concerning the status of ` someone who might be a witness ' because ` that goes to the heart of the grand jury process . '
1292 1371 ... `` Events of recent days make a mockery of your earnest verbal professions .
1372 1529 Far more accurate is your candid recognition that , ` I regret that there have been instances , so it would appear , when that rule has not been abided by . '
1530 1640 ` So it would appear ' hardly does justice to the deluge of leaks which quite obviously stem from your office .
1641 1759 In the past four years , I have written you in confidence about the various leaks that have occurred from your office .
1760 2095 I am making this letter public today because of the calculated tactic your office is now employing of selectively releasing both information dUR ; and falsehoods , dLR ; in an attempt to pressure , manipulate , intimidate witnesses and possible witnesses , affect public opinion in your favor and cause political harm to the President .
2096 2290 I intend to seek judicial relief from these tactics , including contempt sanctions , as soon as practicable , under Rule 6 -LRB- e -RRB- , Barry v. United States , 865 F. 2d 1317 -LRB- D.C. Cir .
2291 2340 1989 -RRB- , and other available legal doctrines .
2341 2583 `` The appalling disregard for the legal and ethical requirements of grand jury and investigative confidentiality and the cynical dissemination of information and misinformation from your office leads me to believe that you have lost control .
2584 2630 These leaks are deeply unfair and prejudicial .
2631 2725 You have a solemn duty to ferret out these leaks and regain command and control of your staff .
2726 3091 The leaks erode a fundamental and venerable principle of the grand jury -LRB- an investigative body enshrined in the Bill of Rights to the Constitution -RRB- that investigations shall be conducted in secret so that those suspected but not charged with crimes will not have their reputations besmirched , without having a forum in which to cleanse those reputations .
3092 3263 `` A report on Wednesday 's NBC Nightly News illustrates , however , what is now commonplace _ legally protected grand jury material strategically leaked from your office .
3264 3442 Matters have gotten so out of hand that NBC 's report on the immunity negotiations between your office and Ms. Lewinsky looks very much like an independent counsel press release .
3443 3566 In the space of three paragraphs , the NBC correspondent refers directly at least four times to ` sources ' in your office .
3567 3853 For example , she states that ` sources in Starr 's office have told NBC news that the information Lewinsky 's lawyers were offering was simply not enough ' and that `` sources in Starr 's office believe the -LRB- -LRB- talking points -RRB- -RRB- instructions came from the White House .
3854 4023 `` Perhaps more pernicious even is a leak two days ago to The Wall Street Journal , purporting to recount the grand jury testimony of a White House steward , Mr. Nelvis .
4024 4197 We now know that the leak _ attributed to ` two individuals familiar with his testimony , ' which is obviously a narrow group centered in your office _ is ` totally false . '
4198 4324 Yet the report was nonetheless spread widely as though true , and was extremely damaging both to the President and Mr. Nelvis .
4325 4448 It also broadcast to the world the kind of evidence you would like to gather , inviting copycat ` testimony ' and the like .
4449 4533 That 's a dangerous and destructive game to play in an alleged search for the truth .
4534 4621 It 's why these investigations must be conducted in secret and why the leaks must stop .
4622 4670 `` Today 's news reports offer more of the same .
4671 4826 A front-page article in today 's New York Times is headlined ` Aide 's Statements Are Said to Differ From President 's , ' and the passive voice tells all .
4827 5146 The article , a flagrant leak from your staff , purports to report what the President 's personal secretary , Ms. Betty Currie , has told ` investigators ' dUR ; -LRB- i.e. your agents -RRB- , dLR ; and these statements are sourced to ` lawyers familiar with her account ' dUR ; -LRB- i.e. your legal staff -RRB- dLR ; .
5147 5336 This combination is repeated throughout the article : `` Paragraph 1 : ` President Clinton 's personal secretary has told investigators ... according to lawyers familiar with her account . '
5337 5420 `` Paragraph 4dAMP ; 5 : ` Mrs. Currie has told investigators ... the lawyers said .
5421 5443 The lawyers also said .
5443 5526 ... ' `` Paragraph 6 : ` Mrs. Currie has told investigators ... the lawyers said . '
5528 5655 `` Paragraphs 12 dAMP ; 17 : ` Mrs. Currie has been extensively interviewed by agents and prosecutors from Mr. Starr 's office .
5655 5727 ... According to the account provided by the lawyers , Mrs. Currie said .
5728 5747 ... ' `` And so on .
5749 5941 Mrs. Currie 's own lawyer has stated that , except for the one sentence statement explicitly attributed to him in the article , this information did not come from Mrs. Currie or her attorneys .
5942 6071 In context , the ` lawyers familiar with the inquiry , ' so frequently quoted in the article , are plainly members of your staff .
6072 6178 `` The NBC report , The Wall Street Journal account and today 's New York Times article are not anomalies .
6179 6350 Over the past two weeks , there have been numerous such selective leaks directly traceable to your office _ the accuracy of which , I might add , are often highly suspect .
6350 6661 ... `` As I have repeatedly pointed out previously in my letters over the past four years , and as you must be aware , it is illegal and wrong to attempt to manipulate witnesses and possible witnesses , the press , the public and our system of justice by selectively leaking information _ accurate or otherwise .
6663 7127 Rule 6 -LRB- e -RRB- of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure , the ABA Standards for Criminal Justice Relating to Prosecution Function and Fair Trials , the National Prosecution Standards published by the National District Attorneys Association , and the Rules of Professional Conduct for the District of Columbia , among other professional codes of conduct , all forbid leaks of purported confidential information of the kind that have sprung from your office .
7127 7379 ... `` The public disclosure of grand jury and investigative information not only violates Rule 6 -LRB- e -RRB- -LRB- 2 -RRB- , it runs afoul of ethical and professional standards of conduct for attorneys , prosecutors , and executive branch officials .
7381 7801 The ABA Standards for Criminal Justice relating to the Prosecution Function provide that ` -LRB- -LRB- a -RRB- -RRB- prosecutor should not make or authorize the making of an extrajudicial statement that a reasonable person would expect to be disseminated by means of public communication if the prosecutor knows or reasonably should know that it will have a substantial likelihood of prejudicing a criminal proceeding . '
7802 8099 ... `` Well , first of all , The Associated Press is reporting tonight that Ken Starr 's office has rejected an immunity deal put forward by Monica Lewinsky 's lawyers , and sources in Starr 's office have told NBC News that the information Lewinsky 's lawyers were offering was simply not enough .
8099 8147 ... The two sides are n't even on the same page .
8149 8267 They do n't rule out an eventual deal , but they say right now Starr wants to focus on accelerating his investigation .
8268 8342 `` And NBC News has learned more about another critical piece of evidence .
8343 8439 A memo first discovered by Newsweek that Linda Tripp claims was given to her by Monica Lewinsky .
8440 8552 The memo appears to be instructions on how to lie to Paula Jones 's attorneys in her suit against the President .
8553 8724 Page one of the talking points obtained by NBC weeks ago , was written , according to experts , in a semi-legal language which would be unusual to come from a 24-year-old .
8725 8884 The second two pages , obtained by NBC today , are less formal , as if they could be notes _ more instructions to Tripp on what to say to help the White House .
8885 8970 In one passage , the notes suggest that Tripp should ignore her own lawyer 's advice .
8971 9016 ` He has been saying you should look neutral .
9017 9084 Better for credibility , ' it reads , ` that you are n't neutral . '
9085 9200 `` Sources in Starr 's office and close to Linda Tripp say they believe the instructions came from the White House .
9201 9268 If true , that could help support a case of obstruction of justice .
9269 9358 But sources also tell NBC News Lewinsky has not agreed to discuss any of that with Starr .
9359 9450 And some of the additional language in the second two pages of the memo is Pentagon jargon .
9451 9567 That indicates that Lewinsky , who had worked at the Pentagon , could have at least had a hand in crafting the memo .
9568 9674 One theory , Lewinsky wrote it on her computer , but with the help of someone else , most likely a lawyer .
9675 9748 Sources say that 's one reason why Ken Starr seized Lewinsky 's computer .
9749 9978 And they also tell us from Starr 's office that they figure the most corroborating evidence they gather , either that helps their case against the president , or it will help eventually make a better deal with Monica Lewinsky . ''
