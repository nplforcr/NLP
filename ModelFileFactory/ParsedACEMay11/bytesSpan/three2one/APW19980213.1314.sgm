575 750 Foreign Secretary Robin Cook , who attended the United Kingdom-Caribbean Forum in Nassau , has urged the colonies to join the Labor government in abolishing the death penalty .
751 874 Cook made the appeal in a Feb. 4 speech in which he said Britain was considering granting full citizenship to its colonies .
875 1095 Toward closer ties , the colonies also are getting their own minister , a forum for annual top-level consultations , and a new name _ `` overseas territories '' _ reflecting they are self-governing rather than dependent .
1096 1151 `` They are saying we must eliminate the death penalty .
1152 1257 But we had a referendum and people voted for it to remain , '' Bermuda Premier Pamela Gordon said Friday .
1258 1443 Other delegates said the former British colonies of Belize and Trinidad and Tobago were upset that the death penalty issue was included in a working session on human rights on Thursday .
1444 1506 British officials had no immediate comment on the discussions .
1507 1622 Some Caribbean countries beset by an increasing number of drug-related murders have tried to use the death penalty .
1623 1760 But they have been obstructed by the Privy Council in London , the highest appeals court for several former and current British colonies .
1761 1885 In 1993 , the Privy Council ruled it was inhumane to execute prisoners who had waited on death row for more than five years .
1886 1985 It recommended that inmates who exceed that period have their sentences commuted to life in prison .
1986 2105 The ruling effectively ended hangings in many Caribbean countries , where appeals cases sometimes drag on for a decade .
2106 2267 Delegates from some former colonies have suggested they will act on longstanding plans to create their own supreme court and cut their ties to the Privy Council .
2268 2486 `` Human rights mean different things to different countries , and for us in the Caribbean we have made it clear we do n't want anybody lecturing us about human rights , '' said Guyanese Foreign Minister Clement Rohee .
