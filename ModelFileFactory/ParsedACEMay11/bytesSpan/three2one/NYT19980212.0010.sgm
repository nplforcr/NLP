Times News Service dLR ; dQC ; dQL ; U.N. weapons inspectors have found evidence that Russia held discussions with Iraq about selling Baghdad equipment that could be used to develop biological weapons , an official familiar with Iraqi weapons programs said .
550 646 But the official cautioned that it was not clear that any equipment had actually been delivered .
647 734 `` There are indications of contacts between the various people , '' the official said .
735 794 `` Whether the contacts resulted in anything I do n't know .
795 844 But this clearly merits further investigation . ''
845 1111 The Washington Post reported Thursday that U.N. weapons inspectors discovered a confidential July 1995 Iraqi government document that detailed long-running negotiations between Iraqi and Russian officials regarding the purchase of a 1,300 gallon fermentation vessel .
1112 1209 The fermentation unit could be used either to make protein for animal feed or biological weapons .
1210 1425 The team reported that `` fermentation , production , aerosol testing and storage existed at that site , '' but that it found `` no evidence of biological weapons per se '' and `` no facility for filling weapons . ''
1426 1526 Even so , inspectors said a great deal of equipment had evidently been removed before their arrival .
1527 1792 Wednesday the Iraqi government offered to open for a limited time a small number of sites it has closed to U.N. arms inspectors , but the United States and Britain held to their insistence that Baghdad cooperate fully with the inspections or risk a military strike .
1793 1857 The Russian negotiations took place around 1995 , the Post said .
1858 2087 Earlier weapons inspectors had said that Iraq had purchased a large amount of materials with potential biological weapons uses , suggesting that the Russians had to have been aware of Iraqi intentions , according to this account .
2088 2205 Iraq used a variety of fermentation vessels to develop biological weapons before the war in the Persian Gulf in 1991 .
2206 2492 In a 1996 report on biological weapons , the Center for Strategic and International Studies , a public policy research institution in Washington , warned that it was easy for would-be terrorists to assemble biological weapons _ using commercial equipment with a capacity of 130 gallons .
2493 2651 In 1991 , when Iraq accepted the Security Council 's terms for a cease-fire in the Persian Gulf War , it maintained that it had no biological weapons program .
2652 2824 But U.N. inspectors later said that they had found `` a capability to research , produce , test and store biological warfare agents '' at Salman Pak , southeast of Baghdad .
2825 3040 The team reported that `` fermentation , production , aerosol testing and storage existed at that site , '' but that it found `` no evidence of biological weapons per se '' and `` no facility for filling weapons . ''
3041 3146 Even so , inspectors said that a great deal of equipment had evidently been removed before their arrival .
3147 3402 The Iraqi government offered to open for a limited time a small number of sites it has closed to U.N. arms inspectors , but the United States and Britain held to their insistence that Baghdad cooperate fully with the inspections or risk a military strike .
3403 3621 In an offer that fell far short of the British and American demands , Iraq 's deputy prime minister , Tariq Aziz , proposed opening eight closed `` presidential '' sites in Iraq to international inspection for 60 days .
3622 3664 He did not disclose their exact locations .
3665 3690 -LRB- STORY CAN END HERE .
3691 3965 OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS -RRB- Aziz further stipulated that the inspectors report not to the U.N. Special Commission charged with searching Iraq for weapons of mass destruction , but directly to Secretary General Kofi Annan and other diplomats and Security Council experts .
3966 4208 Aziz , in an interview with CNN , acknowledged Iraq 's antagonism toward the commission , called by its acronym UNSCOM , whose inspectors have destroyed more Iraqi weapons in the past seven years than were demolished during the 1991 Gulf War .
4209 4249 `` UNSCOM is the adversary , '' he said .
4250 4276 `` It is not the judge . ''
4277 4399 In Washington , President Clinton repeated that Saddam Hussein would not be allowed to set the conditions for inspections .
4400 4466 `` If he will not act , we must be prepared to do so , '' he said .
