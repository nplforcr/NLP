553 677 Now the United Nation 's drug czar , Pino Arlacchi , says he can wipe out the world 's drugs and its suppliers in ten years .
678 700 We have to fight them .
701 733 We do n't have to convince them .
734 799 We have to know them , find evidence , prosecute and arrest them .
800 869 It 's an ambitious effort that the UN is promoting in television ads .
