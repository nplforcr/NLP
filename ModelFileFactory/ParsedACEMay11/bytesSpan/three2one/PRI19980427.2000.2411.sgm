0 121 PRI19980427 .2000.2411 NEWS STORY Another chapter of history that began during world war two is also being written today .
122 279 A Japanese court this morning ruled that Tokyo should compensate three South Korean women who were forced to provide sex to Japanese soldiers during the war .
280 357 The sum is small , a little over two thousand dollars , to each of the women .
358 388 But the symbolism is enormous .
389 495 Up to now , the Japanese government has refused to pay direct compensation to the so-called comfort women .
496 551 Instead setting up a private fund to offer reparations .
552 657 But today the judge ruled that Tokyo had neglected its legal duty to repair the comfort women 's anguish .
658 697 The BBC 's Juliette Hindle is in Tokyo .
698 774 Juliette , on the one hand today 's decision has been hailed as a precedent .
775 836 On the other , it 's being condemned by some women 's groups .
837 849 Why is that ?
850 993 Well it is a breakthrough in many senses because up until now as you mentioned , the Tokyo courts have always ruled in favor of the government .
994 1087 But it now appears that they are truly independent and there had been some doubts about that .
1088 1245 But the reason why it 's also being regarded as dissatisfactory is that it 's a very paltry sum involved , much less than the women were actually asking for .
1246 1303 But also it 's slightly reluctantly given in some senses .
1304 1426 And the government has um already said that it 's likely to appeal and that it 's very disappointed with the court result .
1427 1516 An - and the amount we 're talking about is two thousand two hundred seventy-two dollars .
1517 1611 uh th - the Japanese government has admitted that these women were forced into sexual slavery .
1612 1670 But it has always avoided paying any kind of compensation .
1671 1714 What 's the reasoning behind their refusal ?
1715 1829 The whole issue of Japan 's war past is incredibly sensitive and very difficult for politicians here to deal with .
1830 1925 On the one hand , there 's a growing body of people who think Japan should face up to its past .
1926 2078 But there 's still a very influential group of people who believe that Japan acted in a completely justifiable way given that uh - it was a time of war .
2079 2112 So it 's not a simple issue here .
2113 2210 But there are plenty of people who do think the government is acting in a very anachronistic way .
2211 2277 Maybe that would also shed some light on the issue of the apology .
2278 2393 Cou - could you explain Japan 's reluctance to formally apologize for forcing these people to act as comfort women ?
2394 2414 What is behind that ?
2415 2580 Well , for many years Japan did n't admit to the existence of these wartime brothels where women were forced into prostitution for the pleasure of Japanese military .
2581 2738 um It was not until nineteen ninety-three that the government officially said some of these women had been forced against their will to work in these places .
2739 2859 So , it 's taken that long to get through that barrier of shame or discomfort with atrocities that happened in the past .
2860 3010 I wonder if also there 's an issue of of th - the weight of public apology and how it 's viewed in Japan as opposed to someplace like here in America .
3011 3083 I think there is a very different attitude to what happened in the past .
3084 3208 And , of course , many people here still have relatives , grandfathers , uncles and so on who took part in these atrocities .
3209 3382 So if the whole nation then turns around and apologizes for what those elders did , um they 're really saying that those people ar - are not fit to be part of their society .
3383 3445 And it 's very difficult for Japan to reject this whole group .
3446 3565 I think it would take a - at least another generation for Japan to get over its complex about what happened in the war .
3566 3762 And some of the women who were forced to work in brothels , they are much older now as well , seventy-nine , eighty years old in some cases , but they seem vehement about the issue of restitution .
3763 3804 What what does it seem uh that they want ?
3805 3906 What they 're really campaigning for is a dignified apology so that their suffering is not forgotten .
3907 4034 So that they are honored for the , the awful things that they had to undergo in a situation that nobody hopes will be repeated .
4035 4118 And some of them are speaking out now about the compensation that has been offered .
4119 4258 And apparently women 's groups are working to pass a law that would set the stage for paying compensation to all uh th - the comfort women .
4259 4263 Yes .
4264 4344 As many as two hundred thousand women across Asia were forced into prostitution .
4345 4401 Nobody 's really sure how many of those are still alive .
4402 4465 And as the years go by , it obviously becomes a smaller number .
4466 4538 I think really Japan needs to act soon to be able to assuage this guilt .
4539 4621 Because soon the people who can talk about what happened wo n't be around anymore .
4622 4735 With that kind of pressure , do you think that these women will uh ever get a formal apology from the government ?
4736 4892 I think it 's very unlikely that they will see a national government of Japan stand up and apologize for everything that took place in the second world war .
4893 4977 Just think , over the last fifty-three years , they 've managed to avoid doing that .
4978 5106 There 've been various different prime ministers with various different political backgrounds and they 've all avoided doing it .
5107 5162 They offer half way apologies and individual apologies .
5163 5262 But a national apology , I do n't think we 'll see it in the lifetime of most of the comfort women .
5263 5316 The BBC 's Juliette Hindle speaking to us from Tokyo .
5317 5334 Thanks very much .
5335 5345 Thank you .
5345 5345 .
