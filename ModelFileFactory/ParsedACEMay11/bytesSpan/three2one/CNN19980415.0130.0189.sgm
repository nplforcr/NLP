190 211 The forecast is grim .
212 335 Boeing aircraft says unless safety is improved , there could be one major airline crash a week worldwide by twenty fifteen .
336 408 The Clinton administration says it 's taking steps to reduce those odds .
409 495 We ca n't allow that rise in the number of crashes that would come without the action .
496 561 So we have to do everything we can to make air travel even safer .
562 632 And to reduce mechanical and human failures that can lead to disaster .
633 690 Vice President Gore announced several safety initiatives .
691 805 One would deal with the situation where a crew for unknown reasons , flies a perfectly good plane into the ground .
