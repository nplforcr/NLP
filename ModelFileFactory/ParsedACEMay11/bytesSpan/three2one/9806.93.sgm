0 400 9806.93 NEWS STORY SOURCE : The Washington Post SECTION : A01 LENGTH : 1209 DATE : June 26 , 1998 HEADLINE : ATdT Buys TCI , Looks to One-Stop Future BODY_LEN : 1188 ATdT Corp. formally announced its $ 48 billion takeover of cable TV giant Tele-Communications Inc. yesterday , vowing to become the one-stop provider of a dazzling array of telecommunications services to households across the country .
401 618 The immediate winner in the deal was TCI 's chairman , John C. Malone , who will receive ATdT stock worth an estimated $ 15 billion for stock he personally owns or votes in trust for TCI 's late founder , Bob Magness .
619 855 TCI 's other public shareholders will receive ATdT stock worth almost $ 51 per share , a premium of nearly 32 percent over TCI 's Class A stock closing price on Tuesday , and nearly five times the value of the shares only 20 months ago .
856 1020 Malone and ATdT Chairman C. Michael Armstrong promised yesterday that millions of residential customers will ultimately benefit from the companies ' marriage , too .
1021 1281 By coupling TCI 's cable connections with its own long-distance lines and familiar brand name , ATdT said it will someday be able to offer the first major competition to the regional Bell phone companies , which now hold a near-monopoly on local phone service .
1282 1597 What 's more , ATdT envisions a day when customers can obtain , via a single monthly bill , all of the major telecommunications services : long-distance , cellular and local phone service , high-speed Internet links , as well as pay-per-view movies , ESPN 's game of the week , and new types of electronic shopping .
1598 1854 Said Malone at a news conference in New York : `` If you want to order an extra phone line , all you 'll have to do is point and click ... If you 're watching an entertainment program and want to order Viagra , all you 'll have to do is point and click . ''
1855 1988 He added : `` We 're going to make it easy to use ... -LRB- and -RRB- packaged in a way so that the consumer gets a terrific deal . ''
1989 2044 Combined , the companies will have an impressive reach .
2045 2224 ATdT now serves about half of all residential long-distance customers , although ATdT must rely on local phone firms such as Bell Atlantic Corp. to get to those customers ' homes .
2225 2286 TCI , meanwhile , serves about 10.5 million cable households .
2287 2342 But its wires pass by a total of 17 million households .
2343 2571 It also partially owns companies , such as Cablevision Systems Corp. of New York , whose wires pass by another 16 million households -- giving ATdT potential direct access to as much as one-third of all the nation 's households .
2572 2723 D.C. residents may be among the beneficiaries of ATdT 's plan to upgrade services , since TCI controls the local cable provider , District Cablevision .
2724 2967 But Robert L. Johnson , who is chairman of the partnership that owns a portion of the D.C. system , said yesterday that it might be a candidate for sale because it does n't fit easily into TCI 's cluster of systems in other metropolitan areas .
2968 3057 ATT is hoping regulators will view the deal as a spur to stalled local phone competition .
3058 3248 Analysts said , however , that it could give the regional Bells -- which were spun off from ATdT in 1984 -- a potent argument that they should now be allowed into the long-distance business .
3249 3381 And ATdT will still need the cooperation of its local phone rivals to serve the two-thirds of the country TCI 's cable wo n't reach .
3382 3616 The creation of the `` one-wire world '' that Malone and Armstrong described yesterday is likely to require billions of dollars of additional investment for ATdT and could take years to complete , analysts and ATdT 's competitors say .
3617 3813 Investor worries about this drain on future earnings drove down ATdT stock , the most widely held in the country , which fell $ 5.37 1\/2 yesterday to close at $ 60 on the New York Stock Exchange .
3814 3906 TCI 's Class A shares , in contrast , rose $ 1.06 , to $ 39.75 , on the Nasdaq Stock Market .
3907 3984 Forecasting the telecommunications future has proven notoriously frustrating .
3985 4176 Malone himself told an industry conference in 1992 that cable customers would soon have 500 channels as well as interactive services , such as home shopping , and phone calls via cable lines .
4177 4223 These improvements have failed to materialize .
4224 4340 Phone companies also made their own unfulfilled promises about the `` convergence '' of telecommunications services .
4341 4557 Bell Atlantic -- whose deal to buy TCI foundered in 1993 -- launched two unsuccessful experiments in delivering TV shows , one over copper phone lines and another over so-called `` wireless '' digital relay stations .
4558 4687 For its part , ATdT last year abandoned an effort to market DirecTV 's satellite TV service through its long-distance operations .
4688 4809 -LRB- ATdT officials said yesterday selling cable service , which is more familiar to consumers , should be easier . -RRB-
4810 4953 It also made an expensive -- and largely unsuccessful -- foray into the computer business in 1991 , when it bought NCR Corp. for $ 7.4 billion .
4954 5029 Both Armstrong and Malone vowed yesterday that this time will be different .
5030 5133 They said ATdT would be able to offer phone service over some of TCI 's cable systems within 18 months .
5134 5329 Upgrades of TCI 's network that will enable consumers to receive two-way services , such as lightning-fast connections to the Internet , will be complete by the end of the year 2000 , they added .
5330 5362 But some doubt those timetables .
5363 5643 `` It 's going to be a while before these things are generally available , '' said William Esrey , chief executive of Sprint Corp. , one of ATdT 's main long-distance rivals and a company that once considered a cable-phone partnership with TCI and two other major cable companies .
5644 5753 `` TCI 's -LRB- network -RRB- is not in great shape , '' though its cable systems have improved , Esrey said .
5754 5817 `` It 's not that the cable plant ca n't be made more reliable .
5818 5843 It 'll just take time . ''
5844 6034 When TCI 's wires do become capable of offering local phone service , ATdT may be required to lease some of their capacity to competitors , under terms of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 .
6035 6435 Steve Case , chief executive of America Online Inc. , the Dulles-based online service , noted that possibility yesterday , saying in a statement : `` We look forward to entering into a broadband reseller agreement with ATdT once the merger with TCI is complete , and we look forward to entering similar agreements with other cable companies as they , too , embrace a truly ` open cable ' approach . ''
6436 6527 In light of all this , Sprint 's Esrey questioned whether ATdT was paying too much for TCI .
6528 6763 In addition to the $ 31.8 billion in stock it will pay for TCI 's Class A and B shares , ATdT will take on TCI 's $ 11 billion in debt , plus lay out $ 5.5 billion more to buy back TCI 's interest in Teleport Communications Group Inc. .
6764 6782 and At Home Corp. .
6783 6926 All told , ATdT reckoned the value of the deal is $ 48 billion -- or a little less than twice the annual revenue for the entire cable industry .
6927 7103 The buyout of TCI will apparently mean a greatly reduced role for Malone , perhaps the most powerful man in the cable industry and its best-known figure after Time Warner Inc. .
7104 7129 Vice Chairman Ted Turner .
7130 7389 Although Malone will be a major ATdT shareholder and a member of the ATdT board , his main job will be running Liberty Media Corp. , a spinoff from TCI that holds its minority investments in such cable networks as Discovery and Black Entertainment Television .
7390 7484 Said a longtime Malone colleague , `` It looks to me like John has found his exit strategy . ''
7485 7485 .
