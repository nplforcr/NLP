473 669 Maj. Gen. Shaul Mofaz , 50 , a deputy chief of staff and close friend of Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai , was chosen over his rival , a childhood neighbor of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu .
670 780 The choice was to have been announced on May 1 , but was delayed nearly two weeks because of intense lobbying .
781 939 Although the selection must be formally approved by Israel 's Cabinet Tuesday , Netanyahu 's acceptance of Mordechai 's choice rules out any other candidates .
940 1108 It was not yet clear whether the other contender , Maj. Gen. Matan Vilnai , who is also a deputy chief of staff , would stay on in his position or resign from the army .
1109 1263 As a young soldier , Mofaz failed the entrance exam for officer 's school three times but later developed a reputation as a keen tactician and strategist .
1264 1438 He rose quickly through the ranks of an elite paratrooper unit in the 1973 Yom Kippur War and participated in a daring rescue of a hijacked plane in Entebbe , Uganda in 1976 .
1439 1536 He led troops in Lebanon and served as the army 's commander of forces in the occupied West Bank .
1537 1647 In 1994 he took charge of the Southern Command and two years later was moved to the head of military planning .
1648 1776 Vilnai had been considered the natural successor of current army chief Lt. Gen. Amnon Shahak , who retires from service in July .
1777 1971 The Harvard-educated Vilnai was a star in Israel 's army , promoted to brigadier-general at the age of 34 and the son a famous Jerusalem professor who authored Israel 's most popular guide book .
1972 2150 But Mofaz 's close relationship with the Iraqi-born Mordechai and their common backgrounds as Jews of Sephardic , or Middle Eastern , origin apparently enable him to get the job .
2151 2297 Mofaz , whose family came to Israel when he was 9 , becomes the country 's second Sephardic army chief after Moshe Levy , who served in the 1980s .
2298 2476 Mofaz 's appointment was seen as a boost for the Sephardic population , who make up 50 percent of the country but have held few powerful positions in government and the military .
