0 415 9806.164 NEWS STORY SOURCE : The Washington Post SECTION : D01 LENGTH : 753 DATE : June 20 , 1998 HEADLINE : Berkshire to Buy General Re Corp. ; All-Stock Deal Valued at $ 22 Billion BODY_LEN : 745 Berkshire Hathaway Inc. , the investment holding company controlled by billionaire investor Warren E. Buffett , yesterday agreed to pay $ 22 billion in stock for General Re Corp. , the largest reinsurer in the nation .
416 624 The purchase of Gen Re would broaden Buffett 's reach in the insurance industry and add about $ 24 billion to Berkshire 's existing holdings of investment securities , valued at $ 46 billion at year-end 1997 .
625 830 For Gen Re , the deal affords access to a huge pool of capital and income from its parent that will allow it to maintain more stable earnings and have greater discretion over how to invest its excess cash .
831 995 Buffett said the companies will have a net worth of $ 56 billion , greater than any U.S. company and second only to Royal Dutch\/Shell Group among global companies .
996 1074 Buffett said Gen Re will operate as an independent unit of Berkshire Hathaway .
1075 1148 Ron Ferguson , Gen Re 's chief executive , will join the Berkshire board .
1149 1288 In addition to its size , the deal is noteworthy because Buffett is using Berkshire Hathaway stock as currency , which he prefers to avoid .
1289 1488 Under terms of the agreement , General Re shareholders can choose either 0.0035 shares of Berkshire 's Class A shares , or 0.105 of the Class B shares for each share of Stamford , Conn.-based Gen Re .
1489 1637 Berkshire Hathaway valued the deal at $ 22 billion , based on Thursday 's closing prices , which is approximately $ 276.50 for each share of Gen Re .
1638 1742 That 's a premium of 23 percent to Gen Re 's Thursday close of $ 224.125 on the New York Stock Exchange .
1743 1859 `` We would rather use cash but most of the time sellers do n't let us do it , '' Buffett said at a news conference .
1860 1981 That 's because cash deals usually mean the seller must pay taxes , whereas all-stock transactions are commonly tax-free .
1982 2165 Even though Buffett has recently made huge forays into the markets for silver and government bonds , he suggested that his latest move should not be read as any kind of market signal .
2166 2379 And he added that although he does not like to make his investments using Berkshire Hathaway stock , his latest deal should not be read as any comment on whether he thinks Berkshire Hathaway 's stock is at a peak .
2380 2425 `` It is not a market call , '' Buffett said .
2426 2721 Buffett , who owns huge stakes in such well-known companies as American Express Co. and Coca-Cola Co. as well as The Washington Post Co. , has long fancied the insurance industry for its `` float '' -- the excess money held against future claims but which can be invested to earn current income .
2722 2915 Two years ago , Buffett bought out minority shareholders in Geico Corp. of Chevy Chase , and he also has a subsidiary , National Indemnity , that is a player in the commercial insurance market .
2916 3163 Berkshire Hathaway 's reinsurance division also has been a specialty player in the reinsurance market ; its huge supply of capital has allowed it to underwrite what are termed `` catastrophic '' risks , such as insurance against natural disasters .
3164 3290 But General Re is considered the crown jewel of the reinsurance industry and has itself been seen as an industry consolidator .
3291 3355 In 1994 , it acquired majority control in Cologne Re of Germany .
3356 3597 The purchase of Gen Re also appears to fit the criteria that Buffett has set down over the years for acquisitions : The companies must be simple , management must be in place , and the businesses must generate good returns with minimal debt .
3598 3672 Buffett also said he favors acquisitions of at least $ 5 billion in value .
3673 3849 Over the years , Buffett 's Berkshire Hathaway has been one of the best performing stocks , but its high price and thin trading have kept it out of the reach of many investors .
3850 4004 Yesterday , Buffett said the purchase of Gen Re would add liquidity to Berkshire stock and draw more interest from the institutional investment community .
4005 4144 Reinsurers insure insurance companies , in essence protecting the primary carriers against losses greater than they can stomach themselves .
4145 4317 While the reinsurance market has largely been flat of late , those companies who are in it have been consolidating as the size of the risks to be covered has gotten larger .
4318 4501 By joining forces with Berkshire , General Re will greatly expand its capital surplus -- the money that stands behind any future claims -- and be able to underwrite even larger risks .
4502 4666 Most important , it will be able to hold on to more of the risk and will not have to `` lay off '' portions of risks that are too big for any one company to handle .
