HERSZENHORN dLR ; dQC ; dQL ; dUR ; c. 1998 N.Y. Times News Service dLR ; dQC ; dQL ; NEWARK , N.J. _ A new Essex County task force began delving Thursday into the slayings of 14 black women over the last five years in the Newark area , as law-enforcement officials acknowledged that they needed to work harder to solve the cases of murdered women .
586 795 The police and prosecutors said they had identified different suspects in six of the cases and had yet to find any pattern linking the killings or the victims , several of whom were believed to be prostitutes .
796 979 State , county and local law-enforcement officials have expressed concerns in recent months about a possible pattern of murdered women and a disproportionate number of unsolved cases .
980 1168 Citing an example , Sgt. Derek Glenn , a spokesman for the Newark Police Department , said that of nine women who had been killed last year , suspects had been arrested in only four cases .
1169 1252 But over all , arrests were made in more than 60 percent of murder cases , he said .
1253 1367 Eight of the 14 killings since 1993 were already under investigation by the Newark Police Department , Glenn said .
1368 1606 Of the eight victims , three were stabbed , two were strangled , two were beaten to death and one was asphyxiated , he said , and these different methods of killing and other evidence seem to indicate that the eight cases are not related .
1607 1802 But with the task-force investigation just getting under way , officials have been careful not to draw any firm conclusions , leaving open the possibility of a serial killer in some of the cases .
1803 1853 There have been no arrests in any of the slayings .
1854 1981 `` I have n't seen a pattern yet , '' said Patricia Hurt , the Essex County prosecutor , who created the task force on Tuesday .
1982 2061 `` The type of lifestyle these women have is extremely dangerous , '' she said .
