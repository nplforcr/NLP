''
458 627 The Foreign Ministry added that Russia would not `` resort to extreme measures '' in response to President Clinton 's order to increase troop levels in the Persian Gulf .
628 802 `` We should not allow an armed strike , an American strike , whatever the circumstances , '' Yeltsin told journalists on the eve of a planned visit to Italy and the Vatican .
803 858 `` I told Bill Clinton that we would not allow that . ''
859 978 He added , `` The most important thing is that we assumed a firm stand : no to the settlement through the use of force .
979 1026 It is impossible ; it will mean a world war . ''
1027 1262 For months , Russia has tried to broker a diplomatic resolution of the tension over Iraqi President Saddam Hussein 's refusal to allow international inspections of locations where Iraq is believed to harbor weapons of mass destruction .
1263 1487 But Russia has taken a higher profile in recent days with Yeltsin 's blunt , public warnings against a military strike , which contrasted with earlier diplomatic initiatives that skirted any collision with the United States .
1488 1639 Yeltsin used the `` world war '' formulation Wednesday as well , and aides scrambled afterward to say that it was not a threat of military retaliation .
1640 1755 Yeltsin 's warnings dovetail with criticism of U.S. actions by Russia 's nationalists and Communists in parliament .
1756 1883 Unlike the confrontation with Iraq in 1990-91 , there are few voices here today arguing for cooperation with the United States .
1884 2153 The Iraqi news agency INA reported today from Baghdad that the National Assembly had invited a group from Russia 's lower house of parliament , the State Duma , to visit some of the disputed sites -- the presidential palaces from which U.N. inspectors have been barred .
2154 2207 Yeltsin said today he saw the crisis easing slightly .
2208 2242 `` I am an optimist , '' he added .
2243 2373 `` We still can not say with confidence that everything is all right , that another heightening of tension is out of the question .
2374 2442 Nevertheless , the recent peak of tension was brought down a little .
2443 2473 Tension is on the way down . ''
2474 2553 Yeltsin claimed Russia 's position had attracted support from France and Italy .
2554 2750 `` Britain is still somewhat hesitant , '' he said , but he added that Prime Minister Tony Blair had promised in a telephone call Wednesday not to send more military equipment to the Persian Gulf .
2751 2871 At the same time , Russia 's Foreign Ministry issued a statement saying the threat of U.S. military action still exists .
2872 3010 Russia believes that `` using force in Iraq or threatening to do so is extremely dangerous under any circumstances , '' the ministry said .
3011 3152 Deputy Foreign Minister Viktor Posuvalyuk remains in Baghdad , where he has been negotiating with Iraq 's Deputy Prime Minister , Tariq Aziz .
3153 3319 Earlier this week , Russian officials had called his mission a success , saying he had worked out a compromise allowing for the conditional inspection of eight sites .
3320 3351 Iraq denied there was any deal .
3352 3564 Today , the Interfax news agency quoted a Russian official as saying the process of resolving the crisis was `` at the start of the road '' and that it was premature to conclude that Iraq 's position had changed .
