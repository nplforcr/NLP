0 180 ea980124 .1830.0306 NEWS STORY Forrest , while the lawyers are working on the legal problem , others are grappling with the snowballing political problem of eroding public support .
181 303 The President 's Hollywood friend Harry Thomasson , who 's given advice in the past on public relations , spent the night .
304 422 Mickey Kantor , the former Commerce secretary , has been hired on as a lawyer who 'll also help sell a positive story .
423 573 Even Harold Ickes , who left after the first term , disappointed he 'd not been made chief of staff , is said to be lending a hand on an unpaid basis .
574 720 And leading this team is none other than the First Lady who , during the nineteen ninety-two Gennifer Flowers crisis , took charge so effectively .
721 811 The first urgent requirement is to shore up the President 's support within his own party .
812 889 Prominent Democrats have pointedly not stepped forward to defend Mr. Clinton .
890 1097 In fact , Leon Panetta , his former chief of staff , today called the scandal a crisis for the party and said if the charges are not baseless , it would be better if Vice President Gore became president now .
1098 1228 Party chairman Roy Romer , in an interview with ABC News , appeared horrified at even being asked to comment on Panetta 's advice .
1229 1245 Would you agree ?
1246 1348 I think it 's absolutely inappropriate t - t - ta - to ask and answer speculative questions like that .
1349 1399 You know , it does n't help us solve the problems .
1400 1466 I just think it 's a question that ought not be asked or answered .
1467 1516 Governor , how do you personally feel about this ?
1517 1535 Well , I tell you .
1536 1584 uh I believe that this man is telling the truth .
1585 1711 I do n't know any of the details around this , but I I know he has been uh beleaguered by attacks since he has been president .
1712 1839 This afternoon , Vice President Gore came into the White House to confer with the President , but not about this , it was said .
1840 1958 Along with other national security officials , Gore attended a full scale meeting on another crisis , the one in Iraq .
1959 2036 Some stories suggest that the White House is now paralyzed with this scandal .
2037 2065 It certainly is demoralized .
2066 2160 But at the moment , the important business of considering the next move on Iraq is continuing .
2161 2169 Forrest ?
2170 2203 Sam Donaldson at the White House .
2204 2220 Thank you , Sam .
2221 2249 Now , another point of view .
2250 2347 Joining us , former Clinton advisor now ABC News political ana - analyst , George Stephanopoulos .
2348 2482 And George , quite clearly , the President and his advisors are deeply involved with trying to stem the the bleeding from this crisis .
2483 2530 Are they able to look at other business at all ?
2531 2560 Boy , not too much , Forrest .
2561 2608 You know , the State of the Union is scheduled .
2609 2652 It 's getting written , it has to be given .
2653 2768 But for the most part , everyone else is walking around wondering is their work going to be relevant in the future .
2769 2861 So they watch TV and read the newspapers like everyone else , waiting for the other details .
2862 2885 With one big exception .
2886 2946 The world does n't stop , so national security has to go on .
2947 3046 And that 's why the secretaries of state , defense , the vice president today were meeting on Iraq .
3047 3291 A lot of people have been questioning how this crisis and how the problems the President is facing might affect his decision making in other areas , most particularly the question of Iraq and the growing confrontation between the two countries .
3292 3304 Well , yeah .
3305 3424 Remember , Forrest , this recent movie , Wag The Dog , where a president uh goes to war in order to cover up a scandal .
3425 3536 um That clearly will not happen here , and the situation with Iraq has been building up for an awful long time .
3537 3645 But I think in this case , art actually makes it more difficult for the President to do what he needs to do .
3646 3751 He 'll be sensitive to the criticism that he is taking this action to avoid uh the problems here at home .
3752 3801 ABC News political analyst George Stephanopoulos .
3802 3821 Thank you , George .
3822 3906 Of course , as George mentions , not only Americans are watching this crisis unfold .
3907 4012 Much of the world is paying close attention and , as you can imagine , nowhere more closely than in Iraq .
4013 4037 Here 's ABC 's Mike Lee .
4037 4037 .
