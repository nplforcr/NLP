63 81 I 'm Lisa Mullins .
82 186 China 's new premiere was greeted with thunderous applause today in Beijing 's great hall of the people .
187 338 Ju Rong Zhi actually had been selected months ago by the communist party leadership to overhaul China 's crumbling state industry and its ailing banks .
339 422 The man he replaces , Li Pung , was elected today to head the national legislature .
423 665 Ju Rong Zhi becomes premiere as China 's export fuel growth is stalling , a victim of the Asian financial crisis , but as the world 's Alan Dow reports , Ju is as prepared as anyone to take the tough steps needed to recharge China 's economy .
666 787 As mayor of Shanghai ten years ago , Ju Rong Zhi turned the long neglected city into the emerging financial hub of China .
788 970 In his most recent job as China 's chief economist , Ju was the darling of Western captains of industry who are keen for a piece of the action in the world 's largest captive market .
971 1002 Please do n't come too quickly .
1003 1109 If you come too quickly and if you ca n't make money because of that , please do n't make complaint to me .
1110 1120 Thank you .
1121 1174 Ju Rong Zhi has a reputation for getting things done .
1175 1210 In China , he 's known as the boss .
1211 1320 Ann Yeng of the US China business council in Beijing says that 's why he was chosen as China 's new premiere .
1321 1387 He personally follows up on on all of his policies and directives .
1388 1410 He uses a meritocracy .
1411 1544 He puts in place people who are uh capable and also respond and also he 's willing to fire people , which is pretty unusual in China .
1545 1603 And so people do respond when Ju Rong Zhi wants something .
1604 1675 But Ju 's new mandate will be as challenging as any he 's faced so far .
1676 1772 As premiere , his first big task will be to streamline China 's bloated and corrupt bureaucracy .
1773 1917 Three and a half million civil servants are to be laid off in the next year and many state enterprises will be auctioned off , merged or closed .
1918 2080 There are many politicians who wo n't appreciate some of the cuts Ju is about to make but Ann Yeng says cut he must if China is to overcome its economic problems .
2081 2332 The root cause really is state owned enterprise and the failure so far to reform state owned enterprise in a really significant way and therefore the failure to reform the state banking system which is uh completely intermingled with the state system .
2333 2508 This requires a whole lot of political pain , and so it 's a very , very frightening or bracing task , but Ju Rong Zhi has taken steps that show he 's really serious about it .
2509 2702 Ju may be serious about tackling the country 's huge bureaucracy , but whether he will move the premier 's office from the shadow of its most notorious moment in recent history is n't so clear .
2703 2800 Ju 's predecessor Li Pung became infamous as the man who ordered the tanks into Tiananmen Square .
2801 2920 A fledging move towards democracy was crushed and both China and Li have faced the scorn of many westerners ever since .
2921 3008 But China 's economic reform under Li 's premiership will undoubtedly be his swan song .
3009 3183 Speaking to the people 's congress recently , Lee thanked governments and companies around the world for what he called their sympathy and support for China 's modernization .
3184 3230 A modernization that Ju is suited to continue .
3231 3290 According to professor Song Ko Ching of Beijing University .
3291 3491 especially is the uh reform process , different people have different opinions so there needs to be someone who has some hard ch - uh characters I mean here is a man who can get agreement from others .
3492 3650 The number of TV commercials for consumer goods is evidence of how times have changed in China , change the country 's new premiere seems ready to accelerate .
3651 3685 For the The World , I 'm Alan Dow .
3685 3685 .
