0 44 ea980128 .1830.0095 NEWS STORY Good evening .
45 165 Yes , the President got out of Washington today , and it was very easy to get the impression that he was happy about it .
166 224 Mr. Clinton has not left his problems behind by any means .
225 406 But when he went to the Midwest today to stump for the legislation he laid out in the State of the Union last night , people were glad to see him , though the trip was not flawless .
407 440 ABC 's Sam Donaldson is with him .
441 535 There it was , Air Force One , stuck in the mud at the airport in Champaign Urbana , Illinois .
536 579 The President on board , unable to proceed .
580 665 Was it a show stopper that the pilot trying to make a tight turn ran off the taxiway ?
666 843 But soon , Mr. Clinton and all the plane 's baggage were hotfooting it along to a backup craft hastily flown in , and a day that was going very well for the President continued .
844 920 -LRB- -LRB- NS -RRB- -RRB- When presidents travel , it 's always impressive .
921 971 But for Mr. Clinton today , it was also important .
972 1012 What would the people say about scandal ?
1013 1069 I 'm telling you , we 're moving in the right direction .
1070 1333 Vice President Gore was so uncharacteristically animated in warming up the crowd at the University of Illinois that people leaped to their feet in response , and his introduction of the President may go down as Al Gore 's finest , certainly most impassioned hour .
1334 1388 To join me in supporting him and standing by his side .
1389 1477 I give to you the President of the United States of America , William Jefferson Clinton .
1478 1535 For his part , the President talked policy , not emotion .
1536 1602 But once on the subject of saving social security , waxed lyrical .
1603 1680 I do n't know about you , but when I was your age , I never thought about it .
1681 1727 I thought I would live forever , always young .
1728 1806 Always young , and as far as the typical crowd comment here , always forgiven .
1807 1830 Really , I do n't care .
1831 1875 I mean , either way , it does n't bother me .
1876 2027 I think you 've got to separate into two pieces , what he 's doing for the country and , uh you know , his personal obligations , or his personal life .
2028 2071 They clearly loved him in Champaign Urbana .
2072 2178 But when he finally did get to La Crosse , Wisconsin , someone had stamped in the snow a negative comment .
2179 2294 But here at the rally site in La Crosse , a large crowd is apparently friendly as they listen to President Clinton .
2295 2388 So here 's the strategy today , play on the large , friendly crowds , play on the high polls .
2389 2418 But answer no more questions .
2419 2526 Mrs. Clinton said to Lisa McRee on Good Morning America this morning , no more questions , no more answers .
2527 2588 President Clinton has said he wo n't answer questions either .
2589 2694 And today , the press secretary said he wo n't answer questions at least until the investigation is over .
2695 2738 And Peter , who knows how long that 'll be ?
2739 2762 Sam , thanks very much .
2763 2817 Sam Donaldson with the President in the Midwest today .
2818 2927 Those Americans who heard or saw the President give his State of the Union last night think he was effective .
2928 2991 In fact , seventy-nine percent say they approved of most of it .
2992 3021 Fifteen per cent disapproved .
3022 3148 The big question is can the President convince the Congress , Republicans and Democrats , to do what he would like them to do ?
3149 3189 ABC 's Cokie Roberts is with us tonight .
3190 3262 Cokie , am I right in guessing that it pretty much depends on the issue ?
3263 3328 It depends on the issue , and it depends on the evidence , Peter .
3329 3393 uh In talking to people today , those polls got their attention .
3394 3471 uh They 're willing to give the President a little bit more of a chance here .
3472 3616 And of course , as you say , the issues matter because if it 's something popular that they want to go along with , they 're likely to go along .
3617 3663 But they 're very worried about this evidence .
3664 3725 And bipartisanship could dissolve in a moment , could it not ?
3726 3772 oh I think th - that that 's very fair to say .
3773 3832 It 's an election year , so it was likely to happen anyway .
3833 3875 But uh Republicans see a big opening here .
3876 3922 I mean , they 're certainly likely to take it .
3923 4001 And the Democrats say , you know , there 's a great big cloud hanging over us .
4002 4089 an - wi - i - It could break open on us , and we 're still terribly worried about that .
4090 4114 Okay , thanks very much .
4115 4153 Cokie Roberts on Capitol Hill tonight .
4153 4153 .
