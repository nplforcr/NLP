0 136 CNN19980603 .0130.1490 NEWS STORY There 's a small group of people who like eating the same foods as most of us , minus the preparation .
137 178 Jeanne Moos has more on the raw foodists .
179 205 Peel off those potholders .
206 223 Stifle the stove .
224 265 I 've been raw now for about three years .
266 323 And nothing feels as good as being a hundred percent raw .
324 402 She is a raw foodist , not to be confused with a nudist , who eats in the raw .
403 470 No , a raw foodist is someone who eats raw rather than cooked food .
470 598 ... left and they 're hearing raw food for the first time and think , what is this , the food 's going to jump off of the plate ?
600 622 So what 's for dinner ?
623 643 What 's not cooking ?
644 664 Little ID tags help .
665 739 Mock tuna , for instance , consists of soaked walnuts , carrots and herbs .
740 793 Mock mashed potatoes are actually mashed cauliflower .
794 872 And mock lasagna is really ground almonds with tomato sauce made in a blender .
873 915 Out with the oven , in with the cuisinart .
916 958 Raw foodists say , expect way more energy .
959 1035 They claim raw is better , because cooking kills enzymes that aid digestion .
1036 1099 We 're the only species on the planet that is cooking our food .
1100 1131 I mean , the birds do n't cook .
1132 1153 The bees do n't cook .
1154 1334 Mainstream nutritionists say that argument is for the birds , that our bodies provide all the enzymes necessary for digestion , and that raw foodists are giving up a balanced diet .
1335 1359 What 's left to give up ?
1360 1388 Some people are fruitarians .
1389 1416 Some people eat only fruit .
1417 1464 And some people supposedly do n't eat any food .
1465 1479 Breathatarian .
1480 1512 They get nutrition from the air ?
1513 1577 Well , I saw a picture , and the person looked like a toothpick .
1578 1686 There were few if any heavyweights at this potluck dinner thrown by a raw foodist who goes by the name Rhio .
1687 1726 Rhio is writing a raw food recipe book .
1727 1742 An un-cookbook .
1743 1798 Featuring dishes ranging from unbaked beans to nutloaf .
1799 1834 Even Rhio 's cats are raw foodists .
1835 1870 That 's an organic raw chicken leg .
1871 1921 Not everyone at the potluck felt lucky afterwards .
1922 1940 I 'm still hungry .
1941 2105 But raw food can be as American as apple pie , raw apple pie made with a crust of ground walnuts and dates , unbaked here at a restaurant called Eight Beach Street .
2106 2169 The pie was great , but the fishless sushi was hard to swallow .
2170 2296 After eight months serving mostly raw food , restaurant owner Rune Kongshaug concluded , That New York is not quite ready yet .
2297 2316 We figured as much .
2317 2365 uh-oh They 're cooking more and more menu items .
2366 2408 And , heaven forbid , a stove is on order .
2409 2455 And do n't let proximity to the menu fool you .
2456 2522 You 're not supposed to dig into the plants with a knife and fork .
