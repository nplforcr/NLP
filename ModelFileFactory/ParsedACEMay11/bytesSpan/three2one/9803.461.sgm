0 369 9803.461 NEWS STORY SOURCE : The Washington Post SECTION : A01 LENGTH : 1407 DATE : March 05 , 1998 HEADLINE : China 's Economic ` Boss ' ; Zhu Rongji to Take Over as Premier BODY_LEN : 1355 BEIJING , March 4 - When Zhu Rongji toured the United States in July 1990 , many people called the then-Shanghai mayor `` China 's Gorbachev , '' an appellation that annoyed him .
370 414 `` I 'm not China 's Gorbachev , '' he said .
415 446 `` I 'm China 's Zhu Rongji . ''
447 516 Today there is little doubt that the blunt-spoken Zhu is an original .
517 675 During the annual session of the National People 's Congress that starts Thursday , Zhu is slated to become premier and expand his already considerable power .
676 882 Since being handed the seemingly impossible task of managing China 's chaotic economy in early 1993 , Zhu has moved to remake the arthritic Communist system and bring it into the market-oriented modern age .
883 1054 Moreover , he has done this while engineering a soft landing for the overheated economy and dodging the financial crisis that has beset almost every other country in Asia .
1055 1247 `` He will go down in history as one of the great economic figures of the 20th century , '' said Robert Hormats , a top executive at Goldman Sachs d Co. , who has met Zhu on several occasions .
1248 1347 Hormats ranked Zhu with Ludwig Erhard , who engineered most of Germany 's postwar economic miracle .
1348 1551 Zhu `` has a long-term strategic vision of where to go and how to get there , '' said Nicholas Lardy , an economist at the Brookings Institution who has been a frequent critic of China 's banking system .
1552 1713 Zhu 's ascent marks a victory for economic pragmatism and a further step away from the ideologically driven days of the late Communist Party Chairman Mao Zedong .
1714 1860 Zhu , once condemned as a `` rightist , '' purged from the Communist Party and banished to do menial rural labor , now is known as `` boss Zhu . ''
1861 1996 Already the number three person in the ruling Communist Party , he will become the top official in the day-to-day government apparatus .
1997 2136 `` I 'm very pragmatic and I 'm very happy to have somebody very pragmatic become premier of China , '' said Tianjin Vice Mayor Ye Disheng .
2137 2192 `` He 's a very intelligent guy and a great manager . ''
2193 2377 Despite widespread admiration for his ability among those who know him , Zhu remains largely unknown to most Chinese and is loathed by bureaucrats who have been targets of his rebukes .
2378 2478 Zhu once said he wanted to buy 100 bullets , use 99 on corrupt bureaucrats and save one for himself .
2479 2545 In one meeting , an official showed off a fancy cigarette lighter .
2546 2634 Zhu said the man could n't have afforded it on his salary and dismissed him on the spot .
2635 2737 He also summarily fired a senior provincial bank official whose performance did n't meet his standard .
2738 2837 Later , he threatened to `` chop off the heads '' of regional bank officials who defied his edicts .
2838 2980 `` He knows his stuff , dares to say the stuff , and pretty much sticks to the stuff , '' said a Chinese lawyer with a major Western law firm .
2981 3079 For all his straight talk on economics , however , Zhu 's politics remains something of a mystery .
3080 3146 As vice premier , he has been dubbed China 's `` economic czar . ''
3147 3190 As premier , his portfolio will be broader .
3191 3329 Most analysts say it is unlikely that he would initiate political reforms that might distract from or threaten pressing economic measures .
3330 3592 But many people hope Zhu will prove more liberal and open-minded than his predecessor , Li Peng , who is still associated with the martial law and the bloody army crackdown on June 4 , 1989 , that crushed student-led democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square .
3593 3641 Zhu was born in Hunan Province on Oct. 1 , 1928 .
3642 3717 His father died before he was born , and his mother died when he was young .
3718 3742 Zhu lived with an uncle .
3743 3844 In 1947 , he went to study electrical engineering at Qinghua University , China 's equivalent of MIT .
3845 4015 There he joined the communist-backed New Democratic Youth League in 1947 and the Communist Party in October 1949 , just after the Communist victory over the Nationalists .
4016 4191 By 1952 , Zhu was working for the State Planning Commission , then China 's most important economic institution , responsible for assigning prices , credit and output targets .
4192 4367 In 1957 , however , during Mao 's `` Hundred Flowers '' campaign to encourage criticism of the Communist Party , Zhu criticized a policy of `` irrational '' high-level growth .
4368 4560 When Mao abruptly ended the brief Hundred Flowers period and launched a campaign against the party 's critics , Zhu was labeled a `` rightist '' and sent to the countryside to do menial labor .
4561 4697 Though many people branded as rightists were political liberals and democrats , there is no indication that Zhu fell into that category .
4698 4944 `` If he could n't get along well with people , that could have been enough of a reason , '' said Li Cheng , a professor at Hamilton College in Clinton , N.Y. Zhu was proven right as Mao 's Great Leap Forward soon plunged the country into famine .
4945 5036 In 1962 , Zhu 's `` rightist cap '' was removed and he returned to the planning commission .
5037 5134 But in 1970 , the fourth year of the Cultural Revolution , Zhu again was sent to the countryside .
5135 5263 Zhu was n't rehabilitated until 1979 , after the Cultural Revolution ended and senior leader Deng Xiaoping solidified his power .
5264 5335 Zhu sped through government ranks , becoming Shanghai 's mayor in 1988 .
5336 5485 As mayor , he gained a reputation for efficiency , cutting through the layers of formal approvals and official seals needed to launch joint ventures .
5486 5596 His most severe test came in 1989 , when student demonstrators demanded greater democracy and less corruption .
5597 5743 In Beijing hundreds were killed in the crackdown , but in Shanghai , Zhu 's televised plea persuaded protesters to withdraw relatively peacefully .
5744 5838 Four days after the Beijing massacre , Zhu published a speech in Shanghai 's major newspapers .
5839 6071 Shunning the official terms `` turmoil '' and `` counterrevolution '' to describe the protests , Zhu said : `` The event that occurred recently in Beijing is a historical fact , and historical facts can not be covered up by anybody .
6072 6106 The truth will always come out . ''
6107 6219 The ambiguous statement angered Communist hard-liners who wanted a more vigorous denunciation of the protesters .
6220 6280 Zhu 's handling of events in Shanghai later became an asset .
6281 6411 During his 1990 U.S. tour with other Chinese mayors , Zhu could field criticisms of the 1989 crackdown without sounding defensive .
6412 6448 His style has n't won over everyone .
6449 6665 `` He is a creature of the state planning system and his instincts are regulation , not decontrol of the economy , '' said David Shambaugh , director of George Washington University 's Sigur Center for Asian Studies .
6666 6700 Still , business leaders like Zhu .
6701 6747 In 1991 , Zhu went to Beijing as vice premier .
6748 6861 When Li Peng had heart trouble in April 1993 , Zhu took over the economic portfolio from him and never let it go .
6862 6893 The tasks have been formidable .
6894 7028 In 1993 , banks diverted cash to flimsy business ventures and paid farmers with worthless IOUs , igniting widespread peasant protests .
7029 7054 Zhu banned that practice .
7055 7181 In 1994 , he began to transform the People 's Bank of China from a cash box for state enterprises into a genuine central bank .
7182 7250 Dissatisfied with the bank president , he took over the job himself .
7251 7423 That same year , to improve lax collection of taxes , Zhu forced provinces to turn over tax revenue to the central government in return for a greater share of the receipts .
7424 7502 By 1995 , China 's economy was overheating and inflation hit about 25 percent .
7503 7662 Brushing aside complaints by managers of state-owned enterprises , Zhu clamped down on bank-issued credits to subsidize the enterprises that were losing money .
7663 7710 He also imposed price controls on staple foods .
7711 7791 Today , inflation is zero and prices have been falling slightly for four months .
7792 7843 Zhu has moved cautiously to open financial markets .
7844 8059 In 1993 , recalls Tianjin 's Ye , `` we really wanted to open China wider to the outside world , but Zhu said , ` With only $ 20 billion in foreign reserves how could we open wider and make investors confident ? ' ''
8060 8142 Given Asia 's current economic meltdown , Ye adds , `` He 's been proven right . ''
8143 8285 Today , China has $ 140 billion in foreign exchange reserves , a fixed currency and $ 40 billion to $ 50 billion a year in foreign investment .
8286 8430 Daunting problems lie ahead : ailing banks , a porous social safety net and the specter of huge layoffs by unprofitable state-owned enterprises .
8431 8625 Zhu says the enterprises will be fixed within three years , but the economy badly needs a new engine of growth and job creation for tens of millions of rural migrants and laid-off urban workers .
8626 8775 `` The party recognizes that its strength depends on the economy , and this is a guy who can deliver , '' said Hormats , the Goldman Sachs executive .
8775 8775 .
