Times News Service dQC ; dLR ; dQL ; Back home last year on the Five Bar Ranch in Haskell , Okla. , a town without a traffic light , LeShon Johnson watched a television special : Garth Brooks performing in Central Park .
554 706 `` I saw all these people in the audience in cowboy hats and cowboy clothes , '' Johnson , a recent Giants acquisition at running back , said last week .
707 726 `` I was surprised .
727 819 I said to myself : ` I did n't know there were so many country people in New York City . '' '
820 974 Told that the presence of cowboy clothes does n't verify the presence of country folk in New York , Johnson , a rodeo bull rider until he was 19 , smiled .
975 1060 `` Well , I brought my cowboy clothes to New York with me just the same , '' he said .
1061 1177 `` I get up in the morning sometimes , put them on _ my Wranglers , my Justin boots , my hat _ and just walk around .
1178 1216 It makes me feel like myself again . ''
1217 1390 Two months ago , the Giants signed Johnson , 27 , to a free-agent contract , hoping to spice what has been a predictable running attack with his explosive , breakaway speed .
1391 1457 In Johnson , they also added a player with an uncommon background .
1458 1601 `` LeShon is n't some John Wayne act , '' said Giants coach Jim Fassel , who coached Johnson when both were with the Arizona Cardinals in 1996 .
1602 1628 `` He 's a real cowboy . ''
1629 1763 What else would you call the son of a longtime rodeo cowboy , a football player whose experience with rawhide goes far beyond pigskin ?
1764 1900 Johnson 's childhood was split between life on a working Oklahoma ranch and the rodeo tour where he would accompany his father , Luther .
1901 2099 LeShon rode his first bull when he was 8 , competed on the junior rodeo circuit and in open rodeos _ as did his three brothers _ and he plans to return to the rodeo when his football career is over .
2100 2157 `` I 'm going back as a steer wrestler , '' Johnson said .
2158 2278 Johnson is convinced he would have made it as a top-ranked bull rider had football not interfered with his rodeo career .
2279 2395 His father talked him into giving up the bucking broncos for the bucks he could theoretically make from the Broncos .
2396 2503 `` The rodeo is a tough life , '' Luther Johnson said from the Five Bar Ranch , where he now breeds horses .
2504 2596 `` I gave my sons all of it that they wanted , because I wanted them to see how hard it was .
2597 2661 I told them : ` You do n't see any cowboys driving a Mercedes . '
2662 2789 `` I could have made LeShon a rodeo world champion , and he still would n't have made as much as he made last year in football .
2790 2859 Besides , in the rodeo , if you get injured , your paycheck quits . ''
2860 2886 And injuries are frequent .
2887 3038 `` I got stepped on by a bull , '' said LeShon , who agreed to a two-year deal with the Giants worth $ 350,000 this season including his signing bonus .
3039 3077 `` That joker almost crushed my thigh .
3078 3141 My brother got gored by a bull 's horns inside his upper thigh .
3142 3176 All we saw was blood all over him .
3177 3218 Everybody in rodeo has stories like that .
3219 3259 `` But you know , I still miss it a lot .
3260 3288 I 'm going back some day . ''
3289 3373 LeShon does , however , acknowledge that his father 's advice proved to be sensible .
3374 3501 `` He got me to stop at just the right time , '' said LeShon , who rode his last bull in competition as a sophomore in college .
3502 3589 The following football season at Northern Illinois , Johnson led the nation in rushing .
3590 3758 `` I 've seen too many kids dislocate their knees chasing a $ 400 jackpot , '' said Luther Johnson , who has spent 25 years as a rodeo competitor , promoter or teacher .
3759 3813 `` And being a black cowboy is n't always easy either .
3814 3847 I did n't always get a fair shot .
3848 3921 It 's better for a black cowboy now , but it 's a long ways from good . ''
3922 3947 -LRB- STORY CAN END HERE .
3948 4056 OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS -RRB- LeShon spent the last three pro football seasons with the Arizona Cardinals .
4057 4153 He led the team in rushing with 634 yards in 1996 , gaining 214 in one game against New Orleans .
4154 4288 But he was used sparingly last season as the Cardinals committed to playing Leeland McElroy , the team 's second-round pick from 1996 .
4289 4354 A free agent this winter , Johnson followed Fassel to the Giants .
4355 4482 He is also being reunited with Jim Skipper , the Giants ' offensive coordinator who once coached the Cardinals ' running backs .
4483 4529 Johnson is known for an all-out running style .
4530 4591 He is someone who attacks the line of scrimmage with abandon .
4592 4818 `` We used to say that when you gave LeShon the football , '' Kent Graham , the former Arizona quarterback now with the Giants , said , `` one of two things could happen : He 'd score a touchdown or get absolutely hammered . ''
4819 4902 In his 214-yard game two years ago , Johnson had touchdown runs of 70 and 66 yards .
4903 4951 `` I 'm more refined now , '' he said last week .
4952 4986 `` I 'm learning from my mistakes .
4987 5039 I 'm trying to make defenders miss me more often . ''
5040 5216 But the rodeo rider , the guy who climbed atop 1,500 pounds of bull _ held there only by a rope and a good grip _ still comes out every now and then inside the football player .
5217 5273 `` The bull does n't care who you are , '' Johnson said .
5274 5310 `` And sometimes that 's how I feel .
5311 5420 I do n't care if you 're a 270-pound tackle , before that game is over , I 'm going to take a shot at you . ''
5421 5495 So far , Johnson has kept a low profile in his workouts at Giants Stadium .
5496 5548 `` Nobody knows anything about me , '' Johnson said .
5549 5575 He knows that will change .
5576 5652 On every football team since college , he 's had the same nickname : Cowboy .
5653 5779 Last week , making his second lifetime visit to New York in the span of a week , Johnson wore his cowboys duds into Manhattan .
5780 5916 `` No one in my family other than Dad has ever been to New York , '' he said , looking up at the cityscape as he walked in Times Square .
5917 5948 `` It 's not much like home . ''
5949 6007 Johnson , though , seemed to warm quickly to his new home .
6008 6093 Within a couple minutes , his Justin boots led him across Broadway against the light .
6094 6252 But the man from Haskell , Okla. , never seemed too very far from the Five Bar Ranch _ 25 miles from Tulsa , and for LeShon Johnson these days , a world away .
6253 6383 When someone mentioned that it was a cloudy day downtown , Johnson said : `` The buildings are just too tall to let the sun in . ''
