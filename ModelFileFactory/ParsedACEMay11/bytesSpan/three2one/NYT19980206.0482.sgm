Times News Service dLR ; dQC ; dQL ; NEW YORK _ It is a sprawling hotel ballroom with chandelier lighting .
421 502 And yet , it seemed as if Grant Hill had a bare light bulb hanging over his head .
503 718 There was an interrogation of sorts Friday when the All-Stars gathered for interviews , an inquiry into why Hill 's fingerprints were on the pink slip that was handed to Detroit Coach Doug Collins earlier this week .
719 791 The suspect is popular , photogenic and as wholesome as a milk mustache .
792 949 But like the lavishly paid stars who flanked Hill 's table , he has influence over franchise decision-making and can wield it like a lasso behind the scenes .
950 1007 He possesses the power to remove someone with a firm tug .
1008 1137 `` I still consider Doug a friend , '' said Hill , who was selected to play in the All-Star Game Sunday at Madison Square Garden .
1138 1189 `` I do n't know if he still considers me a friend .
1190 1219 He probably blames me for it .
1220 1290 In his eyes , if I 'd spoken up on his behalf he 'd still be there . ''
1291 1337 A star 's influence does not have to be overt .
1338 1526 But just a few tables from Hill , Orlando 's Anfernee Hardaway , who demanded that Magic Coach Brian Hill be fired last year , explained how his marquee value helps his voice to stand out .
1527 1694 `` If things are in your way of winning , whether it is a coach or players that you think are n't doing their jobs , you have to speak your opinion , '' Hardaway said .
1695 1746 `` For Grant , it 's not like no more Mr. Nice Guy .
1747 1794 It 's speaking up when you have to speak up . ''
1795 1821 That voice carries weight .
1822 1899 It did not matter if Shawn Kemp was viewed as a disruptive player in Seattle .
1900 2009 When he complained about not having a fair contract , when he demanded to be traded , his moans were soothed .
2010 2073 He was traded , given a raise and is Cleveland 's All-Star now .
2074 2199 `` I think we do have a lot of power , '' said Seattle 's Gary Payton , who will start at point guard for the West All-Stars .
2200 2238 `` We can make a lot of things happen .
2239 2373 When you 're a key marquee player on a team , and the NBA has hyped you up , and you make a lot of money , yeah , you can make change .
2374 2563 `` If you 're not happy , and you think the coach is not giving you the freedom to get loose so you can make your team win , a lot of owners and general managers are going to listen to you .
2564 2602 And they are going to make the change .
2603 2642 They 'll look and see what 's going on .
2643 2679 Yeah , you can get somebody removed .
2680 2721 That 's the way it 's going right now . ''
2722 2780 More and more , star players are flaunting their leverage .
2781 2837 Hardaway has the Magic doing flips trying to please him .
2838 2939 Hill was fired , Chuck Daly was hired , and Julius Erving was added to management to please Hardaway .
2940 3103 The franchise does not want to lose him to free agency after next year , knowing how costly it was when another All-Star , Shaquille O'Neal , left two summers ago .
3104 3224 Not shy about asking , what Hardaway wants right now is for the Magic to sign another All-Star `` to build around me . ''
3225 3352 `` I think the franchise players on a team should voice their opinion about what they really want on a team , '' Hardaway said .
3353 3455 `` It 's not fair to the coaches sometimes , but sometimes the coaches are n't fair to the players . ''
3456 3481 -LRB- STORY CAN END HERE .
3482 3671 OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS -RRB- Coaches are asking for larger deals , more power and increased support from ownership in order to counter the star system that caters to highly paid players .
3672 3874 And yet coaches still see the influence of players _ some just twentysomething years old , some who are not even fundamentally sound , some who do not understand salary cap restraints _ gathering steam .
3875 3947 So how is a coach supposed to step lightly around their petulant talent ?
3948 4065 How do they keep from coddling $ 100 million players who need to be pushed without worrying about their job security ?
4066 4248 `` There are things that are disintegrating in our game , and the power of the coach is probably one of those , '' said Seattle Coach George Karl , who will coach the West All-Stars .
4249 4467 `` If you do n't have a situation lucrative to supporting the coach , and a situation where it is very visible to the player that the organization is supportive to the coach , it can be very dangerous to that coach . ''
4468 4539 But there are instances where the power of a player has helped a coach .
4540 4637 Michael Jordan said he would not play for any coach other than Phil Jackson as last season ended .
4638 4759 Despite a strained relationship with management , Jackson was re-signed this summer for one year at a $ 6 million salary .
4760 4831 It will be interesting to see if Jordan will be in Chicago next season .
4832 4956 Maintaining his support of Jackson , Jordan said again this week that he will retire if Jackson does not return next season .
4957 4999 Again , Jordan has asserted his influence .
5000 5109 Not so long ago , in a much more subtle way , Jordan had something to do with Collins being fired in Chicago .
5110 5174 So a star 's power and influence is not new , just more obvious .
5175 5245 `` I think he 's very qualified and capable , '' Hill said of Collins .
5246 5274 `` It just did n't work out .
5275 5350 I do n't know what the average life expectancy is for a coach in one place .
5351 5495 I think it 's unfortunate that it did n't work out in Chicago and unfortunate that it did n't in Detroit , but it was the right move to make . ''
