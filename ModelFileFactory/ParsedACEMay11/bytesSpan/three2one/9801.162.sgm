Korean Company BODY_LEN : 715 SEOUL , Jan. 21 - One of the richest men in South Korea , the chairman of Samsung Co. , said today he would sell $ 75 million worth of landholdings -- keeping only his and his mother 's homes -- to invest in his ailing company and `` share the pain of the nation . ''
458 698 Samsung Chairman Lee Kun Hee , a man considered almost royalty here , also pledged to donate 90 percent of his annual income , or about $ 6 million , to a welfare fund for workers as long as the country remains crippled by financial crisis .
699 833 This dramatic and symbolic announcement came as the president-elect , Kim Dae Jung , vowed to cut his own modest salary by 30 percent .
834 936 -LRB- At the current exchange rate , his presidential salary would amount to less than $ 60,000 . -RRB-
937 1154 Samsung also announced today that the company is scaling back , shelving plans to build a showcase 102-story Seoul office building and cutting ties with a prized asset , the influential daily newspaper Joong Ang Ilbo .
1155 1259 Samsung also plans to sell $ 300 million worth of buildings in London , Singapore and the New York area .
1260 1482 But , in a sign of the growing suffering of ordinary workers , chairman Lee 's plan to donate personal assets to help with the problems was quickly dismissed by angry working people and by political analysts as a pittance .
1483 1619 `` These company heads exploited their workers and got rich off the little people , '' said Lee Hi Ho , a businessman hit by the crisis .
1620 1674 `` It 's their duty to give back some of the money . ''
1675 1704 `` I am really not impressed .
1705 1820 The money did n't belong to him in the first place , '' said an even angrier Han Jae Jyuk , 32 , a worker in Seoul .
1821 2022 But despite criticisms that the corporate elite must do more , Lee 's offering adds to the growing pressure on the men who run South Korea 's biggest companies to forfeit some of their enormous wealth .
2023 2117 For some of the corporate kings , personal helicopters and antique cars are as common as toys .
2118 2330 `` There is strong and growing resentment toward the chaebol heads , '' said Lee Jung Hoon , a political science professor at Yonsei University , referring to the leaders of the country 's business conglomerates .
2331 2414 `` People want the industrial heads to demonstrate their share of the suffering . ''
2415 2605 Lee said some of these titans have amassed so much money that many feel that these family-run companies , along with the government , orchestrated `` institutionalized theft of taxpayers . ''
2606 2730 He said he doubted today 's announcements would satisfy people who have been hit hard by shrinking income and rising prices .
2731 2774 `` So he gives up 90 percent of his salary .
2775 2831 These guys do n't need a salary , '' Professor Lee said .
2832 2978 A growing number of ordinary people , faced with unpaid bills or their small businesses going bust , are trying to sell their homes to raise cash .
2979 3073 Some , at least , were glad the chairman of Samsung was putting up some of his property , too .
3074 3168 `` I know it is only a symbolic gesture , but it means a lot , '' said housewife Kim Sun Yong .
3169 3327 Chairman Lee apparently could recoup the money he invested in Samsung from the sale of his real estate , but the details of his pledge were not clear tonight .
3328 3514 A spokesman for the company , Je Seung Lim , said the chairman also would withdraw cash from his bank account and sell stock for a new fund for workers hurt by the restructuring efforts .
3515 3615 He said the chairman was trying to help the nation `` pull through the current economic hardship . ''
3616 3764 Mass layoffs are expected throughout South Korea in coming months , and millions of workers have been notified in recent weeks about sharp pay cuts .
3765 3955 The most militant unions are asking that the heads of the conglomerates be removed from their businesses and replaced by professional managers , because millions of livelihoods are at stake .
3956 4151 The chairman of the Lotte Group , Shin Kyuk Ho , said last week that he would invest $ 10 million of his own money to bolster his company , and announcements from other chairmen are now expected .
4152 4420 President-elect Kim made it clear Tuesday that he was not pleased with the restructuring plans announced by two other conglomerates , Hyundai Corp. and LG Group ; the wealthy heads of these conglomerates did not offer to use their personal assets in the recovery plan .
4421 4516 The president-elect was quoted by aides as calling their plans `` hollow '' and `` cosmetic . ''
