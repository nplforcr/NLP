0 544 9802.233 NEWS STORY SOURCE : The Washington Post SECTION : A01 LENGTH : 1220 DATE : February 14 , 1998 HEADLINE : Currency Dispute Threatens Indonesia 's Bailout ; Clinton Backs IMF in Pressing Suharto Not to Change Country 's Monetary System BODY_LEN : 1144 The head of the International Monetary Fund wrote a private letter to Indonesia 's President Suharto threatening to cut off bailout money because of a dispute over economic policy , raising the prospect that the international effort to stem Asia 's financial crisis could come unglued .
545 676 President Clinton called Suharto last night to reinforce the IMF position in the dispute , administration officials said yesterday .
677 832 The confrontation between the Indonesian president and his would-be rescuers came as Indonesia 's crisis deepened across both economic and political lines .
833 937 The Indonesian rupiah , which had been climbing , plunged as much as 24 percent against the U.S. dollar .
938 1146 And the country suffered one of the worst outbreaks of violence since the onset of its economic troubles , with thousands of rioters in four towns looting and burning shops in protest over rising food prices .

1179 1613 The letter from IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus , which was dated Wednesday and obtained by The Washington Post , came in response to evidence that Suharto is planning to change Indonesia 's monetary system radically , adopting a Hong Kong-style `` currency board '' in which the value of the rupiah would be rigidly fixed against the dollar and the Indonesian authorities essentially would abandon control over interest rates .
1614 1806 The IMF staff , backed by the U.S. Treasury and economic officials in other major countries , believes that Indonesia is at present incapable of credibly sustaining such a fixed exchange rate .
1807 1990 Camdessus wrote that if Jakarta implemented the move anytime soon , he would urge the board of the 182-nation organization to suspend the $ 43 billion bailout of Indonesia 's economy .
1991 2174 The imbroglio over the seemingly arcane currency issue threatens to plunge Indonesia -- and possibly its neighbors as well -- into a renewed bout of financial turmoil , analysts said .
2175 2364 The stock markets and currencies of Indonesia and several other ailing Asian countries , including South Korea , Thailand and Malaysia , have recovered some of their losses in recent weeks .
2365 2639 The growing sense of stability raised hope in financial capitals and official circles that the worst of the region 's financial problems may have passed following the commitment of more than $ 100 billion in loans from the IMF , World Bank and wealthy nations to the region .
2640 2811 But Indonesia , the world 's fourth-most-populous country , is widely viewed by analysts and officials alike as the nation most likely to drag the region back into crisis .
2812 3049 The rupiah , which fell as much as 80 percent from its value last summer , remains severely depressed , making imports hugely expensive -- so much so that many manufacturing companies can not afford to import the raw materials they need .
3050 3296 And amid increased incidents of rioting in recent weeks , fears are rising that the country could become engulfed by social unrest and attacks by majority Muslims against the ethnic Chinese minority that might undermine stability throughout Asia .
3297 3624 Warning that Indonesia 's problems could spread quickly , the governor of the country 's central bank , Soedradjad Djiwandono , was quoted as saying in wire service reports yesterday that `` contagion effects can be rapid , overwhelming and costly even to countries that have maintained consistently sound economic policies . ''
3625 3904 The rupiah 's slide , to as low as 9,600 per dollar from 7,300 per dollar yesterday , drove other Southeast Asian currencies downward , including the Thai baht and the Malaysian ringgit , although the other currencies later rose as the rupiah recovered to about 8,600 per dollar .
3905 4156 Fueling the currency drops were reports that the clash between Suharto and the IMF was intensifying over the currency board issue , which aroused fears that Indonesia would lose international backing that it badly needs to restore investor confidence .
4157 4360 Suharto has made it clear that he favors a currency board plan championed by a Johns Hopkins University professor , Steve H. Hanke , to fix the exchange rate permanently at about 5,000 rupiah per dollar .
4361 4562 Under a currency board , a country 's monetary authorities essentially pledge to put stability in the exchange rate above all other objectives , including economic growth , cheap credit and employment .
4563 4744 They maintain a large reserve of dollars available to exchange the local currency at the fixed rate , and promise not to print more money without adding to their reserve of dollars .
4745 5045 Among the most successful examples of currency boards is Argentina 's , which eliminated hyperinflation after implementing the approach in 1991 , although the Buenos Aires regime has suffered through periods of very high interest rates and recession to maintain its fixed rate of one peso per dollar .
5046 5210 Contacted by phone in Jakarta where he arrived yesterday to meet with Suharto , Hanke blasted the Clinton administration and the IMF for trying to torpedo his idea .
5211 5494 He noted that the rupiah had staged a powerful rally earlier this week as news emerged that a currency board might soon be introduced -- and that its partial recovery from Friday 's tailspin came after he announced at a news conference that Suharto plans to press ahead with a board .
5495 5648 `` We 're completely puzzled as to why the Clinton administration and the IMF seems intent on destabilizing the currency and the country , '' Hanke said .
5649 5729 `` All the other currencies in the region are going up and down with the rupiah .
5730 5816 So they -LRB- the administration and the IMF -RRB- are destabilizing the whole region .
5817 5899 If this currency board does n't go ahead , we 're going to have total meltdown . ''
5900 6171 But in Washington , the IMF was issuing its strongest public criticism to date of Jakarta 's proposed adoption of a currency board , and a special IMF representative , Prabhakar Narvekar , met with Suharto in an effort to dissuade him , according to wire service reports .
6172 6367 In a speech , Camdessus said he was of `` the strong view '' that the time for a fixed currency in Indonesia `` has not yet come , '' because `` a number of preconditions have to be satisfied . ''
6368 6513 Among these , he said , was the need for Jakarta to obtain substantial reserves of dollars and strengthen the country 's battered banking system .
6514 6771 If Indonesia fixed its exchange rate without holding more dollars in reserve , it would invite speculators to attack the rupiah , the IMF believes , and Indonesia 's cash-strapped banks might collapse if the authorities gave up their ability to print money .
6772 6940 Camdessus and Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers declined to answer reporters ' questions yesterday about whether the IMF would cut off funding to Indonesia .
6941 7203 In his letter , however , Camdessus wrote : `` In the present circumstances ... if a currency board proposal were adopted , we would not be able to recommend to the IMF Board the continuation of the present program because of the risks to the Indonesian economy .
7204 7382 This would be a very unfortunate development , as it would shrink even further the reserve basis for the currency board and further undermine its very slim chances of success . ''
7383 7487 Camdessus said the IMF might favor a currency board for Indonesia once the necessary conditions are met .
7488 7650 Hanke retorted that in his opinion , Indonesia already has met the necessary conditions , and he said he does n't believe Suharto will capitulate to IMF pressure .
