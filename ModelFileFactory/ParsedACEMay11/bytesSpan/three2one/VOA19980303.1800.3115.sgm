0 169 VOA19980303 .1800.3115 NEWS STORY An American classical violin virtuoso with a zest for performing all kinds of music recently released a new recording of popular tunes .
170 215 VOA 's Martin Bush in New York has her story .
216 272 Nadia Solerno Sonnenberg is an energetic violin soloist .
273 350 As one critic puts it , she 's a risk taker on the concert stage and in life .
351 447 Last year , she would not allow a water skiing accident to stop her from performing at concerts .
448 491 The violinist also enjoys deep sea fishing .
492 642 Mounted on the wall of her New York City apartment is a one hundred thirty-six kilogram blue shark she caught after an exhausting three hour struggle .
643 814 Now , in concert and recording , Ms. Solerno Sonnenberg , born in Rome , Italy , is venturing into a field seldom even approached by her fellow violinists , popular music .
815 840 The reason why is simple .
841 862 I feel like doing it .
863 888 I 'm not going crossover .
889 949 There is just , I mean , I will never , ever leave my roots .
950 997 Uh , there 's just a desire to do other things .
998 1038 And , uh , a very strong calling for it .
1039 1091 And I am doing them now and having a fantastic time .
1092 1443 What , what happens , ironically , and I do n't think it 's any great surprise , is when you go and play Brazilian music with phenomenal Brazilian guitarists and you go and play , uh , Cole Porter songs , great arrangements , with Broadway stars , and then you come back and play Tchaikovsky Concerto , you think of the Tchaikovsky in a different way .
1444 1519 It is a new , fresh piece , regardless of how many times you 've played it .
1520 1621 Nadia Solerno Sonnenberg 's latest undertaking in popular music is a new recording called Humoresque .
1622 1748 She performs ten selections on the recording that were all on the soundtrack of a nineteen forty-seven film of the same title .
1749 1895 Humoresque is a weepy tale about an affair between a struggling , talented young violinist and his sponsor , a rich , middle aged alcoholic woman .
1896 1990 At the climax of the movie , the woman drowns herself , having been rejected by the violinist .
1991 2119 As that occurs , the soundtrack sweeps up with the love death , segment , from Richard Wagner 's music drama Tristan und Isolde .
2120 2192 For Nadia Solerno Sonnenberg , playing that arrangement was a challenge .
2193 2278 What 's fantastic about it is that a violinist does not get to play solo Wagner ever .
2279 2367 There is nothing written for violin by Wagner unless your sitting in the fiddle section .
2368 2507 And I did when I was young , when I was a student , and I certainly got the feel of what it 's like to play Wagner and the power of Wagner .
2508 2623 But as a soloist , uh , playing , uh , wh - what a singer wo - would normally be singing was phenomenal experience .
2624 2723 One of the selections from the forty-one year old film , Humoresque , is a tune by George Gershwin .
2724 2763 I grew up listening to songs like that .
2764 2892 My family , you know , wh - what is played in the , in the household when you grow up is what , eh , makes an impression on you .
2893 2946 That , so since I was a kid , I knew Embraceable You .
2947 3100 Whatever the thirty-seven year old Nadia Solerno Sonnenberg performs , she has even made a rock and roll video , her involvement with the music is total .
3101 3243 A music critic describes her as an intensely physical player who sways and stomps and grimaces and even cries in the grip of her music making .
3244 3365 Another reviewer praises her for a tendency to treat every musical phrase as though she just discovered the deep meaning .
3366 3464 Four years ago , the violinist accidently nearly sliced through the small finger on her left hand .
3465 3544 A delicate operation restored the finger to full use , but it was a close call .
3545 3691 These days , as the Washington Post notes , Nadia Solerno Sonnenberg is playing with the dedication of someone who has been given a second chance .
