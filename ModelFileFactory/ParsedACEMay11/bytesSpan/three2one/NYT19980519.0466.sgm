WALD dLR ; dQC ; dQL ; dUR ; c. 1998 N.Y. Times News Service dLR ; dQC ; dQL ; WASHINGTON _ Crucial computers at the State Department and the Federal Aviation Administration are vulnerable to criminal or terrorist attack because the agencies do not properly control access to them , congressional auditors say .
563 817 The auditors , from the General Accounting Office , found that unauthorized people could gain unsupervised access to computers at the State Department , in person or by modem , and then steal or destroy sensitive information , or shut the computers down .
818 1049 At the aviation agency , the investigators found , the mainframe computers that air traffic controllers use to prevent midair collisions are not well protected against direct physical damage by intruders or attack over modem lines .
1050 1221 The findings were the subject of a pair of GAO reports made public on Tuesday at a hearing of the Senate governmental Affairs Committee , where security experts testified .
1222 1482 In response , a State Department spokesman , James Rubin , said that `` we take the GAO 's findings very seriously '' and that the department had corrected some of the vulnerabilities since receiving a more detailed version of the auditors ' report last month .
1483 1686 The aviation agency , in contrast , said in a statement that `` there is little evidence to indicate any attacks on FAA 's systems or facilities to date have been anything other than common vandalism . ''
1687 1852 The agency 's computers are aging , and the statement said that they would be difficult for hackers to penetrate by telephone because they are now unique to the FAA .
1853 2056 The auditors ' report , however , said that `` while these configurations may not be commonly understood by external hackers , one can not conclude that old or obscure systems are , a priori , secure . ''
2057 2189 And they are certainly vulnerable to attack `` by disgruntled current and former employees who understand them , '' the report said .
2190 2399 While the usual mode of hacking is over the Internet or by telephone line directly into the target computer , the aviation agency has a problem simply keeping its computer hardware secure , the auditors found .
2400 2572 The agency `` has not assessed the physical security controls at 187 facilities since 1993 , '' the report said , `` and therefore does not know how vulnerable they are . ''
2573 2921 As for the report on the State Department , it said auditors at department offices were able to gain top-priority access to several systems that would have allowed them to `` view international financial data , travel arrangements , detailed network diagrams , a listing of valid users on local area networks , e-mail and performance appraisals . ''
2922 3126 The Senate committee 's ranking Democrat , John Glenn of Ohio , summed up by saying : `` We 're vulnerable to terrorists , malicious criminals , or even bored teen-agers seeing what they can hack into . ''
