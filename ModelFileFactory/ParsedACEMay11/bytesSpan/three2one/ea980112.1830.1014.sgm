0 138 ea980112 .1830.1014 NEWS STORY So since it is such a mess in Asia , the question is what can the United States do to fix it , if anything .
139 225 The International Monetary Fund wants to provide a one hundred billion dollar bailout .
226 324 And the IMF is asking the United States for about nineteen billion dollars to replenish its funds .
325 373 Many members of Congress do not want to ante up .
374 430 ABC 's Cokie Roberts joins us from Capitol Hill tonight .
431 452 Cokie , good evening .
453 474 Good evening , Peter .
475 583 This is an interesting coalition that the uh opponents have put together between conservatives and liberals .
584 617 How did it come together and why ?
618 698 Well , we 've seen that kind of coalition before on some foreign policy matters .
699 850 And what you have is conservatives who do n't want to spend that much money and also do n't want to give President Clinton the win if he asks for this .
851 920 And you have liberals who say why should be we bailing out big banks ?
921 1022 Those are n't our people , and there 're problems here at home , why should web - we be helping Asia ?
1023 1176 So you get those two groups together , and then the President finds himself having to go vote by vote by vote trying to put together the bailout package .
1177 1312 And i - is it a coalition do you think can hang together , or is the President likely to have his way as he did ultimately with Mexico ?
1313 1388 Well , you 've got uh you 've got members of Congress heading for Asia now .
1389 1534 There 'll be lots of hearings at the beginning when Congress comes back into session , and uh they will try to educate people about these things .
1535 1666 But uh I think the President will probably eventually get it because of the concern about American companies like we 've just seen .
1667 1808 But uh he 's might have to give up some other big ticket items for that , Peter , like special trading authority and uh the UN dues payments .
1809 1844 Okay , Cokie , thank you very much .
1845 1883 Cokie Roberts on Capitol Hill tonight .
1884 1967 As said , there 's a very serious debate already about whether a bailout will work .
1968 2121 The argument goes if they manage to blow it on their own , why should the United States give them more money to make it even bigger , the mess , that is .
2122 2237 Joining us this evening is Todd Buchholz , an expert on the market and a former economic advisor to President Bush .
2238 2295 Todd , the argument , as I understand it , goes this way .
2296 2325 You bail out these economies .
2326 2406 The American taxpayer basically helps countries that will not reform themselves .
2407 2436 What 's the counter argument ?
2437 2511 Well , Peter , it 's a little bit like paying protection money to the Mob .
2512 2626 If you 're a shopkeeper , you feel awful about doing it , but you wonder whether you 'll feel worse if you do n't .
2627 2817 uh The US government and the IMF uh are effectively making out checks to these east Asian governments because we want to keep their financial and stock market problems far away from our own .
2818 3018 Now , the same argument goes that the United States is going to help out American banks who have made unwise , risky investments and that if you do so , they wo n't be discouraged from doing it again .
3019 3068 Well , and I think that argument has a lot to it .
3069 3390 uh In fact , if these governments permitted bankruptcies , if even American investors who bought uh who bought bonds or stocks in those companies suffered losses , they would think twice and realize that this market , any market , any legitimate market , that is , has ups and has downs , and it 's not all about profits .
3391 3491 There are losses , and we must keep the system honest , and that means permitting some bankruptcies .
3492 3532 Okay , Todd Buchholz , thanks very much .
3533 3589 An argument that will continue in the next several days .
3590 3640 We 'll have more news from today in just a moment .
3640 3640 .
