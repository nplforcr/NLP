200 296 As a British negotiator to the northern Ireland peace talks put it today , the clock is ticking .
297 407 As the violence there increases , politicians have resumed the search for peace in the British-ruled province .
408 510 When the negotiators ended their previous meeting a month ago , they had n't even agreed on an agenda .
511 628 But today the British and Irish governments , which co-sponsored the talks , presented a proposal setting priorities .
629 782 The suggestions have been made before but the plan , if accepted , would clear the first hurdle on the course to a peace settlement for northern Ireland .
783 883 In Belfast , the BBC 's Tom Coulter has been following the day 's events and assesses the proposals .
884 1023 Well the main thrust of the proposals are tha - that , first of all , there will be discussion and negotiation about Constitutional change .
1024 1413 Now , that will take in the Irish government 's a - articles two and three of their constitution , which lays claim to jurisdiction over northern Ireland , but it also brings in the UK government 's ah government of Ireland act which actually partitioned northern Ireland from the rest of the island back in the twenties , so all things are there are up for grabs an - and for negotiation .
1414 1475 There 's also a new intergovernmental tier being implemented .
1476 1847 uh It will address the totality of relations between the two islands and certainly it would bring in the new uh Scottish Parliament which is to be , to be formed , the new Welsh assembly which is also to , to be elected and also th - m - a northern Ireland assembly which will be uh voted for on proportional representation grounds and then the two sovereign governments .
1848 1952 So it will be an umbrella body which will oversee the totality of relationships between the two islands .
1953 2147 Tom , is there enough here to keep the nationalists happy , those people who want a united Ireland , but also to appease the Unionists , the people who want to remain part of the United Kingdom ?
2148 2196 Two positions which appear to be irreconcilable .
2197 2352 Well , they would seem to be to most outsiders and certainly with the constitutional change as put forward , or the a possibility of constitutional change .
2353 2539 That wi - will pro- provide difficulties for all sides because obviously the unionists , as you say , want to s - , they are pro-British , they want to remain part of the United Kingdom .
2540 2578 The republicans want a united Ireland .
2579 2610 But that 's there on the table .
2611 2638 Everything is on the table .
2639 2661 They can negotiate it .
2662 2889 And I suppose at the end of the day it 's what consent is agreed and I suppose there are elements within John Hume 's SDLP who perhaps ar - are looking in a longer term , do n't expect to see a united Ireland in the short term .
2890 3066 They would be quite happy with the north south cross border bodies which will have some powers , obviously , and an - an overview of the situation within the island of Ireland .
3067 3118 So that may be enough to keep most people on board .
3119 3558 Certainly the reaction I have been getting uh just talking to the various parties is that there are ele - elements in this that they like , there are others they 're not so happy with , but really at the end of the day I think now people are going to have to face some unpalatable , hard facts about how northern Ireland 's future is going to be mapped out and that 's what they 're going to have to address in the coming weeks and months .
3559 3683 Is this document , released today by the British and Irish Governments , does it look like it is the basis for an agreement ?
3684 3792 Well , certainly th - the Irish government have described it as a road map , um uh a way forward for people .
3793 4094 uh th - uh the British government have described it , say it 's not set in tablets of stone but it is a way where we can progress these talks because most pa - parties ' complaint here has been that they 're not really addressing the core issues and have n't been since the talks started in September .
4095 4143 But neither are getting down to the core issues .
4144 4205 Whether agreement can be reached , let 's be honest about it .
4206 4418 This is a - a been a problem that 's been running now for not only thirty years of violence in northern Ireland but certainly for the last seventy years , so it 's going to be a very difficult problem to resolve .
4419 4709 But I think what the governments are hoping for is that th - if there is the good will and the desire and the willingness to compromise on all sides , then , yes , there is a basis for agreement and for a solution to the problems that uh b - bedeviled this province for , for so many years .
