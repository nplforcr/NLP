461 818 The lawsuit , filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court as part of CSC 's counteroffensive against Computer Associates ' $ 9.8 billion hostile takeover bid , alleged that Computer Associates ' CEO , Charles B. Wang , and its president , Sanjay Kumar , offered to pay Van B. Honeycutt , Computer Sciences ' CEO , more than $ 50 million to support the offer .
819 1039 CSC also alleged that the two executives promised Honeycutt he would receive guaranteed stock options worth at least $ 35 million and a guaranteed seven-year contract with an annual base income of at least $ 2.5 million .
1040 1126 Discussions about potential executive compensation are typical in merger negotiations .
1127 1327 Indeed , Computer Sciences ' board , as part of its takeover defense , has voted multimillion-dollar `` golden parachute '' payments to Honeycutt and 16 other top executives should CAI win the battle .
1328 1486 But Computer Sciences ' suit characterized the alleged offer by the Computer Associates ' executives as part of an `` unfair , unlawful and fraudulent scheme .
1486 1486 .
1486 1486 .
1489 1570 to acquire CSC at less than its value by employing wrongful and illegal means . ''
1571 1698 A Computer Associates International spokesman said the company could not comment because it had not seen a copy of the lawsuit .
1699 1859 Court papers filed by Computer Sciences detailed a Dec. 18 , 1997 , visit by Wang and Kumar to CSC 's El Segundo , Calif. , headquarters to meet with Honeycutt .
1860 2029 At the meeting , according to CSC 's lawsuit , they told Honeycutt , `` would n't it be great if we were partners , '' but Honeycutt responded that CSC was not for sale .
2030 2190 After some additional discussion , the suit alleged , Wang asked Honeycutt if he and Kumar could speak privately for five minutes , and Honeycutt left the room .
2191 2328 When he returned , the suit alleges , Wang made the offer of a $ 50 million payment as well as the stock options and seven-year contract .
2329 2542 `` The conduct of defendants was an intentional , unlawful and corrupt attempt to buy Honeycutt 's support of a transaction that only benefited CAI at the expense of CSC and its shareholders , '' the suit alleges .
2543 2623 It said the executives ' conduct violates California laws on commercial bribery .
2624 2824 Computer Sciences asked the court to prohibit Computer Associates from proceeding with its proposal to acquire CSC , and from communicating with CSC 's customers and employees about any proposed deal .
2825 2950 The California company also asked that CAI be ordered to pay restitution to CSC `` in an amount to be determined at trial . ''
2951 3117 Computer Sciences , which employs 7,300 people at its federal systems division in Falls Church , named Wang , Kumar and Computer Associates as defendants in the suit .
3118 3304 Last week , Islandia , N.Y.-based Computer Associates offered to pay $ 108 a share for CSC 's 85 million shares outstanding , and to assume about $ 700 million in Computer Sciences debt .
3305 3403 CSC sharply rejected the offer last Thursday , saying the deal would make `` no business sense . ''
3404 3681 In a letter to Wang last week , Honeycutt said Computer Sciences had `` moved to strengthen our protections against your ill-considered and unwelcome attempt to force an acquisition '' and that the company would `` utilize every legal means necessary to defeat your attempt . ''
3682 3802 Yesterday 's action was part of what analysts predict will be a drawn-out takeover battle filled with legal maneuvering .
3803 3993 `` Computer Sciences is usually prone to diplomacy , but that 's certainly not the case here , '' said Bob Dornan , senior vice president of Federal Sources , a McLean-based consulting firm .
3994 4063 `` If they go down , they 're going to go down in a blaze of guns . ''
