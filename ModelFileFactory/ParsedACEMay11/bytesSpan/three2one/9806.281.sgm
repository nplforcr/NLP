451 753 The Lagos-based leadership of Nigeria 's democracy movement had called for demonstrations today to press Nigeria 's new leader , Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar , to quickly end Nigeria 's 15 straight years of military rule by handing power to a transitional government under jailed politician Moshood Abiola .
754 899 The protest marked the fifth anniversary of Abiola 's apparent victory in a presidential election that was subsequently scuttled by the military .
900 1073 But relatively few Nigerians responded to the call , underscoring that , while the military government is deeply unpopular , few Nigerians are ready to actively confront it .
1074 1184 Democracy activists said protests were held today outside Lagos , but there was no independent report of them .
1185 1288 Many Nigerians are consumed by their daily struggle for survival amid the country 's economic collapse .
1289 1438 And some activists and Nigerian journalists have said many people want to give Abubakar more time to respond to the popular demand for civilian rule .
1439 1564 Abubakar was named head of state Monday night after his predecessor , Gen. Sani Abacha , died , reportedly of a heart attack .
1565 1725 Abacha had promised a handover to civilian rule but maneuvered himself into position as the only legal candidate in presidential elections scheduled for Aug. 1 .
1726 1859 Nigerians have overwhelmingly rejected the Abacha transition plan , but Abubakar , upon taking power , declared he would complete it .
1860 1964 The democracy movement contends that the Abacha process can only be a front for continued military rule .
1965 2086 The government had banned today 's protests , and police and troops heavily deployed forces around Lagos to prevent them .
2087 2176 At a square in the Yaba district , an estimated 200 people , mostly young men , gathered .
2177 2282 Many carried anti-government placards and leaflets , according to news agencies and Nigerian journalists .
2283 2468 As pro-democracy leaders headed by human rights lawyer Gani Fawehinmi arrived to begin a rally , police swept into the square , firing tear gas canisters and warning shots into the air .
2469 2517 No deaths or injuries were immediately reported .
2518 2603 People fled , and Fawehinmi collapsed from the tear gas and was taken away by police .
2604 2789 His spokesman in the United States , Lanre Banjo , said tonight that police had charged Fawehinmi with inciting the public against the government and had released him after a few hours .
2790 2937 In all , Banjo said , the protest 's organizing group , the Joint Action Committee of Nigeria , was aware of about 40 people who had been arrested .
2938 3058 Police also took to the streets in Ibadan , but the city , Nigeria 's second-largest , remained calm , the BBC reported .
3059 3118 Anti-government riots in Ibadan left seven dead last month .
3119 3231 Lagos and Ibadan are the main cities of Nigeria 's ethnic Yorubas , who are the country 's most alienated group .
3232 3456 Yorubas say they are denied a fair share of political power by northern ethnic groups -- including Hausas and Fulanis -- that have dominated the military and the government since Nigeria 's independence from Britain in 1960 .
3457 3575 Today 's protest underscored that Nigeria has suffered more or less continual crisis and confrontation for five years .
3576 3743 In 1993 , the northern-dominated government of Gen. Ibrahim Babangida , having promised a return to civilian rule , held elections on June 12 for a civilian president .
3744 3939 But when the vote count showed Abiola , a southern Yoruba , crushing his northern , Hausa-speaking opponent , Bashir Tofa , the government canceled the vote , throwing the country into an uproar .
3940 4069 Babangida soon surrendered power to a military-backed civilian interim government , which Abacha pushed aside after three months .
4070 4192 A year later , he jailed Abiola for insisting on his claim to power , and protests have continued sporadically since then .
