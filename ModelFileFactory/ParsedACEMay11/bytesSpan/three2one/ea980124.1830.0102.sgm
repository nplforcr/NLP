0 44 ea980124 .1830.0102 NEWS STORY Good evening .
45 172 There are clear indications tonight the crisis in the White House is growing worse for President Clinton , possibly much worse .
173 310 A new ABC News poll today shows less than half of Americans believe Mr. Clinton has quote the honesty and integrity to serve effectively .
311 430 A poll also shows that forty-eight per cent of Americans believe the President did have an affair with Monica Lewinsky .
431 479 Thirty-five per cent believe he told her to lie .
480 598 And if the President lied under oath by denying the affair , sixty-seven per cent of Americans think he should resign .
599 697 The crisis in the White House is now four days old , so you can see how quickly events are moving .
698 738 And there were fresh developments today .
739 813 We have several reports , beginning with ABC 's Jackie Judd in Washington .
814 892 What about putting the squeeze on uh Ms. Lewinsky a - out at the Ritz Carlton ?
893 904 No comment .
905 1044 The struggle between independent counsel Ken Starr and lawyer William Ginsburg about Monica Lewinsky 's future reached no resolution today .
1045 1137 Ginsburg is demanding immunity from prosecution for Lewinsky if she cooperates in the probe .
1138 1184 Starr seems unprepared at this point to agree .
1185 1338 Because Starr could potentially bring such charges as perjury and obstruction of justice against Lewinsky , some analysts say that he has the upper hand .
1339 1413 Ken Starr knows going in that he needs the cooperation of Monica Lewinsky .
1414 1513 But he also knows that Monica Lewinsky desperately needs the protection of the independent counsel .
1514 1546 She does n't have a good option .
1547 1573 But Starr faces a dilemma .
1574 1752 If Lewinsky changes her story to say there was an affair with Mr. Clinton , and that he did ask her to lie , will she then be accused of saying whatever it takes to save herself ?
1753 1797 The President 's lawyer certainly thinks so .
1798 1872 Everybody e - e - e - can bend if if placed under enough pressure to bend .
1873 1944 And uh Mr. Starr seems hell bent on uh on on getting President Clinton .
1945 2107 Because Starr knows that Lewinsky 's credibility will be questioned no matter what , he 's moving quickly to seize evidence that would stand on its own in a case .
2108 2291 A source tells ABC News that Lewinsky consented to having FBI agents go through her apartment at the Watergate on Thursday for evidence related to the alleged affair with Mr. Clinton .
2292 2380 And then , of course , there are the tapes recorded by Lewinsky 's friend , Linda Tripp .
2381 2522 Today , a New York literary agent admitted that she told Tripp to tape the calls as a way of protecting herself if all of this became public .
2523 2562 It 's just your word against the world .
2563 2686 And before I go out with you and make it my world and my reputation , my family against the world , we got to do something .
2687 2747 Tonight , Newsweek released excerpts from some of the tapes .
2748 2830 In one portion , Lewinsky says , If I needed to , I would say this did not happen .
2831 2917 And she also predicted she would quote get personally screwed if it ever came to that .
2918 2926 Forrest ?
2927 2953 Jackie Judd in Washington .
2954 2973 Thank you , Jackie .
