0 466 9806.122 NEWS STORY SOURCE : The Washington Post SECTION : A04 LENGTH : 584 DATE : June 23 , 1998 HEADLINE : Lewinsky to Turn Over Book Purchase Information ; Agreement Resolves 1st Amendment Dispute Between Starr and Bookstore Owners BODY_LEN : 547 Monica S. Lewinsky has agreed to provide independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr with information about her book purchases , resolving a First Amendment dispute between Starr and the Dupont Circle bookstore Kramerbooks .
467 633 `` We 've accomplished what we set out to do , which is protect the rights of privacy of our customers , '' said Bill Kramer , co-owner of the popular store and cafe .
634 872 The former White House intern , the central figure in Starr 's investigation of President Clinton , has previously made cooperative gestures toward Starr , including allowing her apartment to be searched and providing handwriting samples .
873 1038 In late March , Starr subpoenaed Kramerbooks and the Georgetown outlet of the Barnes d Noble chain , asking for details about at least 16 purchases made by Lewinsky .
1039 1222 The former intern reportedly told her one-time friend Linda R. Tripp that she gave Clinton the phone-sex novel `` Vox , '' and Starr 's team was seeking to corroborate that statement .
1223 1394 On April 6 , Lewinsky lawyer Nathaniel H. Speights told U.S. District Court Judge Norma Holloway Johnson that his client would be willing to give the information to Starr .
1395 1570 `` In March , April , May , it was crystal clear that Lewinsky 's position was the same : She was willing to give the information , '' said Kramerbooks lawyer Carol O'Riordan .
1571 1687 `` And it was crystal clear to my co-counsel and myself that -LRB- Starr -RRB- was refusing to go and ask for it . ''
1688 1861 Johnson ruled in early April that Starr had to show a `` compelling need '' for the information before he violated the First Amendment rights of Lewinsky and the bookstores .
1862 1954 This led to the Barnes d Noble subpoena being dropped and the Kramerbooks subpoena narrowed .
1955 2028 Kramer had been planning an appeal when yesterday 's deal was worked out .
2029 2118 `` This agreement allows us to avoid the time and expense of the appeal , '' Kramer said .
2119 2233 Kramerbooks ' challenge to Starr drew support from a wide range of retailing , publishing and free speech sources .
2234 2317 Yesterday , those groups pronounced themselves pleased with the case 's resolution .
2318 2531 `` From the beginning we believed the subpoena was an example of gross prosecutorial overreaching that seriously threatened core First Amendment values , '' said Louis Bograd of the American Civil Liberties Union .
2532 2764 `` We 've established an important precedent that will stop prosecutors from fishing around in bookstore records just because they want to , '' said Chris Finan , president of the American Booksellers Foundation for Free Expression .
2765 2847 If Kramerbooks ' appeal had gone forward , there was some doubt it would have won .
2848 2999 `` Establishing a legal basis for bookstores ' privilege would have been a tough sell , '' said Robert O'Neil , a University of Virginia law professor .
3000 3109 He noted that there was no constitutional protection for journalists seeking to withhold identity of sources .
3110 3393 Still , O'Neil said , `` the next time a grand jury or a prosecutor seeks to compel such information from a bookseller , he can look back and cite this as a time when the customer turned out not only to be the appropriate source for the information , but an entirely adequate one . ''
3394 3624 In another legal battle over evidence , the Justice Department filed the final brief in its effort to persuade the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to stop Starr from bringing Secret Service officers before a grand jury .
3625 3747 The Justice Department is appealing a lower court ruling that the Secret Service enjoys no legal right of confidentiality .
