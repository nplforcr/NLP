0 131 ea980112 .1830.1564 NEWS STORY Finally from us this evening , our regular Monday report about how the government spends your money .
132 273 There 's been a lot of talk from the President about getting younger people to buy their way into the Medicare program , letting them anyway .
274 340 The criticism has been that the Medicare system can not afford it .
341 365 Medicare short of money ?
366 440 ABC 's Jackie Judd has a classic report on how Medicare spends your money .
441 633 Imagine walking into a grocery store and paying twice as much as you need to for a box of cereal or a loaf of bread , or pulling up to a pump and paying twice as much for a gallon of gasoline .
634 729 It 's what Medicare does every day when it pays for items like wheelchairs , walkers and canes .
730 753 It 's all done legally .
754 768 This is legal .
769 795 But it 's still a rip-off .
796 913 The rip-off involves the three and a half billion tax dollars spent by Medicare on supplies and equipment every year .
914 936 How could this happen ?
937 1047 Unbelievably , Congress and the agency that oversees Medicare do not require competitive bidding by suppliers .
1048 1197 In fact , they 're paid top dollar at prices fixed way back in nineteen eighty-six , even though prices on the open market have plummeted since then .
1198 1300 So somebody could walk into a store and pay far less for a piece of equipment than what Medicare pays ?
1301 1314 That 's true .
1315 1445 What 's also strange but true , is even another government department , the Veterans Administration , pays far less than Medicare .
1446 1518 The VA does enforce competitive bidding , and the results are startling .
1519 1575 This is a saline solution , very simple saline solution .
1576 1688 We found that Medicare was paying uh seven dollars , uh over seven dollars and thirty cents for this one bottle .
1689 1774 The Veterans Administration was paying a little over two dollars for the same bottle .
1775 1883 Another example , Medicare pays seventy-six dollars for the same walker the VA buys for twenty-five dollars .
1884 1994 The total overpayment on just eighteen items surveyed , two hundred and thirty-six million dollars every year .
1995 2051 Suppliers claim all that extra money guarantees quality .
2052 2162 To guarantee the system continues , those same suppliers have invested time and money in cultivating Congress .
2163 2189 And so far , it 's worked .
2190 2301 Congress did recently approve a small program to test how competitive bidding for equipment and supplies works .
2302 2364 The critics call that a timid step when billions are at stake .
