140 224 In Mexico today , the government is closing the net on foreign nationals in Chiapas .
225 365 It set up more military checkpoints in the southern state in an attempt to round up foreigners suspected of supporting the Zapatista rebels .
366 529 Last week , the government expelled fifteen foreign nationals from Chiapas , accusing them of violating the Mexican constitution by engaging in political activity .
530 622 The World 's Alejandra Martins is now in San Cristobal De Las Casas in the heart of Chiapas .
623 724 Alejandra , why is the Mexican government focusing on foreigners in Chiapas and trying to expel them ?
725 940 The government is saying very clearly that , uh , it 's not xenophobic at all , that they are expelling the foreigners because they are violating the Mexican constitution by supporting the pro Zapatista communities .
941 1063 But , uh , they might have been , eh , to some foreigners who might have been engaging in some sort of illegal activities .
1064 1214 But , uh , the truth is for the vast majority of the foreigners who I 've seen in these communities are not engaging in any kind of activities at all .
1215 1248 They are there just as observers .
1249 1514 And the interesting thing is that the leaders of the pro Zapatista communities that I 've talked to want them to be there , because they feel afraid that at some point , uh , the army might enter the communities , and they feel afraid of the paramilitaries as well .
1515 1599 And they feel that by having foreigners there , it 's a kind of , it 's a guarantee .
1600 1904 So you 're saying that they look on the foreigners as a kind of protection , and in the event th - that more and more foreigners are expelled , is it seen as the government 's aim to try and intensify the campaign against the Zapatistas , uh , with the , with the , ultimate goal of destroying the group ?
1905 1995 This is certainly the feeling among some of the leaders of this pro Zapatista communities .
1996 2089 It is difficult , really , to know at this point what the strategy uh - of the government is .
2090 2247 Uh , the President , President Zedillo , is saying that , uh , the government wants to negotiate , that they do n't want a military solution to the conflict .
2248 2398 But , on the other hand , it 's difficult to see how negotiation can take place , because there is a complete lack of trust , uh , between both parts .
2399 2454 Who are the foreigners who you 're talking about there ?
2455 2521 I know that you said many are tourists and , and , uh , observers .
2522 2600 The ones who seem to be supporting the Zapatistas , uh , who exactly are they ?
2601 2634 And are they primarily Americans ?
2635 2651 Not necessarily .
2652 2872 I went to one of the communities , one of these pro Zapatista , uh , communities , uh , where they have , uh - autonomous municipality that they 've established , the ones that the government says are completely illegal .
2873 2915 And I found there French , uh , nationals .
2916 2939 I found there Italians .
2940 2980 I found there lots of people from Spain .
2981 3126 I did n't find anybody from the US , but I did find people from the US here in San Cristobal who were ready to travel to some of the communities .
3127 3187 And , uh , the motivations are very , very , uh , different .
3188 3379 In some cases , you have idealistic Europeans or Americans who want to come and , and learn , uh , from the communities how to live in a community , how to take decisions among the community .
3380 3443 Other people are just concerned about the situation in Chiapas .
3444 3551 Uh , they get all sorts of information in their countries , and they want to come and see what 's going on .
3552 3711 So is it your sense , Alejandra that the kind of crackdown that we 've been seeing on , on foreign nationals in Chiapas that that sort of thing might continue ?
3712 3723 I think so .
3724 3868 Uh , when I was traveling to one of these , uh , pro Zapatista communities , I was traveling in a van , and there was a French woman in the van .
3869 3910 We were stopped at a military checkpoint .
3911 3939 We stayed there for an hour .
3940 4237 And uh even though she was not doing anything at all , uh , she was traveling on a tourist visa , but just the fact that she was entering a highly sensitive area was enough for the authorities to confiscate her tourist visa and ask her to report , uh , to the authorities within forty-eight hours .
4238 4291 She has to report today , so we 'll see what happens .
4292 4397 But this indicates it 's just , uh , entering this area is enough for the authorities to raise suspicion .
4398 4496 The World 's Alejandra Martins speaking to us from San Cristobal De Las Casas in Chiapas , Mexico .
4497 4519 Thank you , Alejandra .
4520 4537 Thank you , Lisa .
