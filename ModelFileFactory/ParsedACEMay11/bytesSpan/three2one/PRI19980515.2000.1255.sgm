69 230 A hundred years ago the United States emerged from the Spanish American war a world power with a reach that extended to the Philippines , Guam , and Puerto Rico .
231 279 For Spain , the war also marked a turning point .
280 411 Madrid was forced to cede those three territories to the United States and grant independence to another of its possessions , Cuba .
412 530 This week our series on the Spanish American war 's legacy has focused on the war 's victor and the spoils of victory .
531 659 In our final report , The World 's Megan Cox Gerden examines the war 's disastrous yet strangely liberating impact on the loser .
660 826 By eighteen ninety-eight Spain had been fighting a full-fledged Cuban insurrection for three years , and its draconian tactics were provoking an international outcry .
827 958 Spanish troops were rounding up Cuban civilians into what were effectively concentration camps and laying waste to the countryside .
959 1004 Peasants were dying by the tens of thousands .
1005 1161 With the sensational American press of the day amplifying every atrocity , it became impossible for US politicians to ignore continued Spanish rule in Cuba .
1162 1319 Historian Edward Malifakis at Columbia University in New York believes the American press inflamed the public 's desire for US military intervention in Cuba .
1320 1518 Spanish behavior was there was obviously cruel , but no crueler certainly than it usually is in , you know , most wars and nothing remotely like the kind of th - stuff that 's happened subsequently .
1519 1606 But it was enough to create a movement in the United States of th - a pro-war movement .
1607 1726 The Spanish government resented American interference in the running of what Spain believed to be its God given empire .
1727 1942 So , as American newspapers overflowed with gory tales of Spanish cruelty in Cuba , and American politicians demanded that Spain let Cuba go , Spanish newspapers were whipping up sentiment against the United States .
1943 2068 Caricatures depicted Spain as a ferocious lion and the United States as a pig , wallowing in its wealth but too fat to fight .
2069 2123 In truth , the Spanish lion was geriatric , toothless .
2124 2206 The cost of maintaining its occupying army in Cuba had left Spain nearly bankrupt .
2207 2276 The war on that rebellious island brought heavy social costs as well .
2277 2434 Resentment seethed among conscripted soldiers who were in Cuba only because they could n't afford to buy their way out of the draft as the aristocracy could .
2435 2561 Accounts from eighteen ninety-eight show that Spain 's top military men knew they could n't prevail against the United States .
2562 2596 Spanish politicians knew it , too .
2597 2693 But according to Mark Hayes , a historian with the US Navy , Madrid felt it could not back down .
2694 2952 In general , I mean I have a lot of sympathy for the Spanish government at the time , because they 're , they 're trying to put things back together after a lot of problems that really began with the French intervention in the country in the Napoleonic wars .
2953 3012 And they 're still trying to deal with the effects of that .
3013 3174 That French intervention started with Napoleon installing his brother as king of Spain and ended with the great armies of Europe fighting it out on Spanish soil .
3175 3288 The wreckage of that war left Spain in a terrible position to take on the United States in eighteen ninety-eight .
3289 3432 But Jaime Ojeida , who recently retired as Spain 's ambassador to Washington , says the weak government in Madrid was squeezed by circumstance .
3433 3579 The Spanish , uh , th - public opinion was very strongly moved by the idea of uh honor , the honor of the country , the honor of the armed forces .
3580 3630 But Spanish honor was no match for a superior foe .
3631 3787 And Spain 's American colonies fell swiftly , first Guam without a fight , then Cuba and the Philippines with the Spanish fleet sunk in a day in each place .
3788 3889 By the time American troops turned their guns on Puerto Rico , Spanish resistance had lost its gusto .
3890 4024 Recently opened diplomatic cables to Puerto Rico from Madrid show that Spain instructed the island 's defenders to resist if possible .
4025 4185 Historian Luis Agrait of the University of Puerto Rico says that was a far cry from Spain 's noisy vow to defend its empire to the last peseta and the last man .
4186 4228 Spain would have preferred to avert a war .
4229 4494 Spain , apparently , the government uh feared that if they lost Cuba eh without putting up a fight , first of all the monarchy could collapse , uh and there could be a , a financial collapse in Spain , and uh there would also be a a collapse of the public finances .
4495 4584 As it happened , none of the worst Spanish fears , apart from losing Cuba , materialized .
4585 4635 The monarchy and government both survived the war .
4636 4793 Spain 's economy improved and Spain enjoyed a renaissance of culture and ideas , a rejuvenation that historian Edward Malifakis says sprang from humiliation .
4794 5025 You go and fight against an enemy and , you know , the enemy hardly without uh any effort dest - defeats you and that s - reveals your incompetence and your backwardness and so on , so there was a great psychological shock to them .
5026 5238 That shock produced what 's called the generation of eighteen ninety-eight , a loose collection of writers , artists and thinkers who used the disaster as a way to probe the deepest questions of Spanish identity .
5239 5323 The generation of eighteen ninety-eight was sometimes pitiless in its introspection .
5324 5504 One leading intellectual , Ortega Igaset , wrote , Spain today , rather than a nation , is a cloud of dust remaining after a great people have galloped down the highway of history .
5505 5535 Spain was no longer an empire .
5536 5599 Again , former Spanish ambassador to Washington , Jaime Ojeida .
5600 5622 It was a medium power .
5623 5648 Not maybe , not a strong .
5649 5707 Economically rather backward , with many problems at home .
5708 5966 A loss of Cuba somehow removed the shackles of um imperial ideology , a bit like what happened in Great Britain after the second world war , and the nation started uh beginning to think of itself as uh Spain , following the British example , as little Spain .
5967 6101 Loosing what Ojeida calls the shackles of imperialist ideology did not produce overnight the peaceful European country Spain is today .
6102 6114 Far from it .
6115 6218 Spain was to endure civil war and a thirty-six year dictatorship before emerging as a stable democracy .
6219 6353 But historians believe eighteen ninety-eight was a turning point in Spanish history , when Spain woke up from its long imperial dream .
6354 6402 For The World , I 'm Megan Cox Gerden reporting .
