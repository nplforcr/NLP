0 185 PRI19980303 .2000.2550 NEWS STORY Tomorrow the board of supervisors of Loudon county , Virginia , will vote on whether a school now located in Mount Vernon can relocate to their county .
186 291 In some respects , that 's typical county business , but tomorrow 's vote has international implications .
292 432 The board will decide whether the Islamic Saudi Academy , funded by the government of Saudi Arabia , can move to Ashburn village , Virginia .
433 523 But local residents have not exactly laid out the red carpet for their would be neighbors .
524 567 The World 's Nancy Marshalll has our story .
568 722 Inside the Islamic Saudi academy in Mount Vernon , Virginia , many of the girls wear head scarves and some of the neatly dressed children are in uniforms .
723 817 The instruction is in English for most classes , in Arabic for language and religious studies .
818 895 The school says it teaches the children to be good Muslims and good students .
896 966 They 're learning a civics lesson from the residents of Loudon county .
967 1091 The Islamic Saudi Academy has twelve hundred mostly American students but would take thirty-five hundred if it had the room .
1092 1221 The academy bought a hundred acres in Loudon county , Virginia , and asked for permission to build a fifty million dollar campus .
1222 1375 In the nearby suburban housing tracts , someone dropped off leaflets warning the school could bring thousands of Middle Eastern strangers and terrorists .
1376 1453 Some residents of the mostly white , mostly middle class area became alarmed .
1454 1525 James Zogby of the Arab American Institute says it 's a familiar story .
1526 1685 There is , a - at a very deep level in our culture , um I think , a sense of , of ignorance about Islam , a fear about who Muslims are and what they 're doing .
1686 1773 Many local residents denounced the bigotry , but opposition to the school then shifted .
1774 1848 Now critics of the academy are targeting its owner , the Saudi government .
1849 1948 Pastor James Allmen of the fellowship church and school in Ashburn has led the anti-Saudi campaign .
1949 2071 James Allmen says he has no problem with a privately funded academy , but he has a big problem with a Saudi funded school .
2072 2236 The Saudi Arabian government has an atrocious record on human rights and is known to be one of the worst offending countries when it comes to religious persecution .
2237 2253 That 's correct .
2254 2304 And that is a condition of the application , then .
2305 2576 That is a condition of - At a public hearing on the Islamic Saudi Academy 's application , the split in county opinion was obvious , supporters of the academy , including Ann Robinson , said the Saudis were just providing a service and it was unfair to penalize children .
2577 2693 We do not further the purpose of human rights in the world by violating the human rights under our own constitution .
2694 2901 But opponents said the school might be a target for terrorist attacks , complained about its tax exempt status , and wondered why the Saudis are not compelled to allow Christians to worship in their country .
2902 2975 Virginia Welch delivered this message to the county board of supervisors .
2976 3113 I urge you to do the right thing and send a message to the Saudis that the citizens of Loudon county embrace religious and human freedom .
3114 3241 Loudon county officials say they 'll rule on the application based only on land use issues and ignore all the other objections .
3242 3438 What 's really behind those objections , some say , is Loudon county 's collision with a new reality in America that the country is changing religiously as surely as it is racially and ethnically .
3439 3547 According to the Arab American institute , Islam will one day be the second largest religion in the country .
3548 3700 For an indication of the problems that could face Muslims as they integrate into American life , one need look no farther than Loudon county , Virginia .
3701 3738 For The World , I 'm Nancy Marshalll .
