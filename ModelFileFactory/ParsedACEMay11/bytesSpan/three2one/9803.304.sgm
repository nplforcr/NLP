0 506 9803.304 NEWS STORY SOURCE : The Washington Post SECTION : A21 LENGTH : 736 DATE : March 13 , 1998 HEADLINE : Hindu Party Loses Ally ; India Faces Turmoil In New Parliament BODY_LEN : 693 NEW DELHI , March 12 - The likely leadership of India 's next government grew more uncertain today after the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party , which emerged from a midterm election with the most seats in the new Parliament , lost support of its biggest ally and fell further short of a parliamentary majority .
507 748 The political dispute prompted President K.R. Narayanan , who is empowered to appoint the prime minister , to announce he will explore the possibility of an alternative coalition government that would merge the two other blocs in Parliament .
749 964 Narayanan said he will continue talks with the Bharatiya Janata Party -LRB- BJP -RRB- even as he confers with leaders of the two other blocs -- the once-dominant Congress party and the ruling United Front coalition .
965 1115 The president is to meet Friday with Sitaram Kesri , outgoing president of the Congress party , which controls the second-largest bloc of legislators .
1116 1301 Narayanan has appointments later in the day separately with former prime minister H.D. Deve Gowda , representing the United Front , and two of the ruling coalition 's communist leaders .
1302 1448 The day 's developments demonstrated how the close division of the new Parliament makes it even more unstable than the last one , elected in 1996 .
1449 1618 The old Parliament threw together two governments led by the United Front , a coalition of 13 parties whose reign was marked by indecision , infighting and policy drift .
1619 1779 In this year 's staggered voting , the BJP-led bloc -- with a dozen partners , almost as many the United Front -- emerged as the top vote-getter with 252 seats .
1780 1881 The biggest ally of the BJP was a regional party from the southern state of Tamil Nadu with 18 seats .
1882 2027 And that party , the All India Dravidian Progressive Federation , has thrown a big obstacle into BJP plans to take power as soon as this weekend .
2028 2155 J. Jayalalitha , the Dravidian party 's leader , has declined to submit a formal statement of support for a BJP-led government .
2156 2376 So when Atal Bihari Vajpayee , the BJP 's choice to become prime minister , met Narayanan today , he carried written commitments from 240 legislators -- 33 short of a majority in the 545-member lower house of Parliament .
2377 2539 Had Vajpayee brought commitments from a majority of the new Parliament 's members , Narayanan presumably would have formally invited the BJP to form a government .
2540 2669 Jayalalitha , a former movie star whom her party 's members call `` Mother , '' did not disclose why she was withholding support .
2670 2828 But leaders of the BJP and her party said the hangup was a rejection of her nominee as finance minister , Subramaniam Swamy , a Harvard-trained mathematician .
2829 3060 Vajpayee , 71 , last year indicated his discomfort with the BJP 's alliance with Jayalalitha , a former chief minister of Tamil Nadu who was jailed on corruption charges after her state government was defeated in the 1996 election .
3061 3173 Political observers said Vajpayee was personally even more uncomfortable with Swamy , who was once a BJP member .
3174 3371 Vajpayee told reporters that BJP leaders were still talking to Jayalalitha 's party , but he sounded firm in his stance , saying , `` I do n't feel any pressure , nor will I bow to any pressure . ''
3372 3507 The impasse could prove to be a break for Congress and the United Front , which have had their own problems sorting out a new alliance .
3508 3731 Several partners of the United Front have expressed reservations about backing a Congress-led government , but if they combined forces , the two blocs would need about 10 more supporters to control a majority in Parliament .
3732 3964 So far Congress and the United Front have not engaged in serious discussions about renewing their awkward alliance , under which two United Front governments ruled with Congress 's backing -- but not its membership in the coalition .
3965 4169 They had appeared content to watch whether the BJP could pull together a majority and , if it could , to let the Hindu nationalist party grapple with the difficulties of coalition politics , Indian-style .
4170 4247 Those troubles surfaced perhaps sooner than the BJP 's opponents anticipated .
4248 4472 V.P. Singh , a former prime minister and driving force behind the United Front , used matrimony and a deadly , illegal Indian custom as a metaphor for the implications of the dispute between the BJP and Jayalalitha 's party .
4473 4608 `` If before a marriage , all terms and conditions are not agreed upon , '' Singh told reporters , `` it will lead to bride-burning . ''
