0 195 ea980130 .1830.0802 NEWS STORY Tonight , we are going to take A Closer Look at something that really appears to bother many of you and , in some respects , bothers some of us , anonymous sources .
196 270 Sources say is a phrase that 's been around for the history of journalism .
271 444 But during this challenge to the President , which has so many incendiary parts to it , the reporting from sources who wish to remain unidentified is at a pretty high level .
445 505 First , here 's ABC 's John Cochran on the art of anonymity .
506 714 ABC News has learned from sources that A highly placed source says those We 've been told that the President was calling friends today As one senior aide told me this morning , it 's a meltdown at the moment .
715 730 Whoa , hold on .
731 788 Who are all these unnamed people talking , these sources ?
789 806 What are sources ?
807 841 Who might a White House source be ?
842 916 Although it could be the President or the First Lady , that would be rare .
917 980 But aides and friends are not shy about speaking , anonymously .
981 1073 Friends of First Lady Hillary Clinton have told CBS News , quote She 's in full battle mode .
1074 1124 One described her as being in full battle regalia .
1125 1284 In any White House , a senior source could be any of a dozen top aides who , in order to stay out of trouble , is willing to say more privately than in public .
1285 1332 They usually talk to push the White House line .
1333 1424 Sometimes that gives reporters information or a lead they can use to get other information .
1425 1572 But sometimes , according to former press secretary Marlin Fitzwater , leaking can be downright evil , such as trashing the President 's opponents .
1573 1608 Did Fitzwater ever do that himself ?
1609 1659 Well , I did it a few times , much to my ah shame .
1660 1719 Many leaks in this case have not come from the White House .
1720 1874 Two sources familiar with the independent counsel 's investigation tell That phrase , sources familiar with the investigation , could mean several things .
1875 2055 It could mean the independent counsel himself or someone on his staff , trying to put pressure on potential witnesses or just trying to impress the reporter with how much he knows .
2056 2113 It 's the same with lawyers trying to help their clients .
2114 2198 And reporters are willing to conceal a source 's identity in return for information .
2199 2254 Media critics say reporters should give you some clues .
2255 2383 Give some idea of where the person is coming from , whether that person has a very special agenda that he or she may be pushing .
2384 2435 Information from unnamed sources is often accurate .
2436 2517 Still , remember the warning The New York Times gives in this reporters handbook .
2518 2575 The best source is the source that is identified by name .
2576 2618 John Cochran , ABC News , the White House .
2619 2631 Here , here .
2632 2836 The most famous anonymous source in the modern history of political journalism was Deep Throat , the key source for the Washington Post during their reporting of Watergate and President Nixon 's downfall .
2837 2918 Ben Bradlee Ben Bradlee ran the Post then , and we talked to him in London today .
2919 2971 You relied at a tremendous level on unnamed sources .
2972 2988 Did you have to ?
2989 3005 uh Yes , we did .
3006 3010 Why ?
3011 3124 uh Because uh he would not allow us to name him and uh because uh we could n't eh uh initially find anybody else .
3125 3295 uh He steered us uh in various directions , and he called he called us back in what he thought were blind alleys , but uh uh we had to use him because he was what we had .
3296 3337 What 's the problem with unnamed sources ?
3338 3447 The unnamed sources problem is simply this , they could take you for a ride , or they could certainly try to .
3448 3548 But I do n't think the public understands that uh everybody who talks to a journalist has an agenda .
3549 3612 uh They do n't talk to you out of the goodness of their hearts .
3613 3655 They want to get a special message across .
3656 3790 A good journalist , y - you know this , uh understands that , and therefore puts everything from that source through a special filter .
3791 3945 That is so as - uh elementary in our business that uh people talk to you for a reason , and that your first job as a reporter is to know that reason cold .
3946 4055 Give us the Ben Bradlee lesson on what people should watch for most when they 're reading you or watching us .
4056 4222 Well , when , w - uh if if the source is unidentified , take a minute to uh figure out , A , why the person wo n't talk , and that will add suspicion to what he says .
4223 4361 Then figure out who uh uh has a s - uh a uh an interest in this particular version of the talk , and then see if you ca n't figure it out .
4361 4361 .
