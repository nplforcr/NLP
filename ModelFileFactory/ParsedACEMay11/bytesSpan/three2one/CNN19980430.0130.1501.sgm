0 92 CNN19980430 .0130.1501 NEWS STORY People sometimes wear jewelry to bring out their features .
93 215 Jeanne Moos shows us a piece of jewelry that lets folks know how you feel , and this one puts that old mood ring to shame .
216 268 It would make a fine gift for a female cardiologist .
269 309 I ca n't see down there , is it beating ?
310 320 my brooch .
321 381 But if this brooch stops beating , better call nine one one .
382 412 It 's beating to my heartbeat .
413 423 Oh , cool .
424 513 Harry Winston Jewelers on Fifth Avenue prides itself on selling rare jewels of the world .
514 585 But it 's a really rare jewel that requires you to strap on electrodes .
586 616 Bare skin , below the nipples .
617 771 The electrodes transmit your heartbeat to this receiver , which activates light emitting diodes that make the six red rubies pulse surrounded by diamonds .
772 801 We 'll see if it 's accurate .
802 829 Wow , it really does match .
830 884 They do n't call it the heartthrob brooch for nothing .
885 895 Good idea ?
896 906 Dumb idea ?
907 931 We I think it 's stupid .
932 964 what is it do n't get the point .
965 1018 Well , the media lab at MIT developed the technology .
1019 1127 Professor Michael Hawley thinks there 's a big future for accessories and clothing that monitor your health .
1128 1202 Y - you get dressed in the morning , pull on your pants one leg at a time .
1203 1264 And your clothing starts to make those sorts of measurements .
1265 1295 You think that 's far fetched ?
1296 1392 Professor Hawley can already monitor the internal temperature of climbers scaling Mount Everest .
1393 1450 They swallow a pill that 's actually a radio transmitter .
1451 1538 Well , we like to joke that you 'll be able to see the reading on a rectal thermometer .
1539 1581 With the climber on the summit of Everest .
1582 1614 Do n't try that with the brooch .
1615 1635 This is a prototype .
1636 1681 It 's price tag is enough to cause heartburn .
1682 1694 Two hundred .
1695 1698 hm .
1699 1712 One thousand .
1713 1732 A hundred thousand .
1733 1744 keep going .
1745 1768 Five hundred ca n't be .
1769 1779 very good .
1780 1783 um .
1784 1828 I think you 're in cardiac think I am , too .
1829 1921 We had to have a security man accompany us as we showed the brooch to folks on Fifth Avenue .
1922 1948 We let this woman wear it .
1949 1962 Am I beating ?
1963 1991 You 're beating to my heart .
1992 2014 Is anything happening ?
2015 2034 Is it going faster ?
2035 2067 I can - I ca n't really eh tell .
2068 2118 Well , you could tell after doing a set of situps .
2119 2150 This is before , this is after .
2151 2235 The mere sight of someone attractive would not make your heart beat faster , really .
2236 2285 I mean , that 's just what you see in the movies .
2286 2292 Could .
2293 2337 Will you end up like ET , extra transparent ?
2338 2377 Well , a stranger 's hug had no impact .
2378 2414 nor did the sight of a handsome man .
2415 2443 So much for that experiment .
2444 2565 But when the heartthrob brooch was first introduced , Leonard Nimoy , alias Mr. Spock Do you know anything about vulcans ?
2566 2586 Got to kiss a model .
2587 2603 Both were wired .
2604 2632 and both their hearts raced .
2633 2663 You ca n't bypass this brooch .
