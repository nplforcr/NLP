Perdue , chairman of the poultry empire that bears his family 's name , probably is best known for his appearances in television commercials selling chicken .
429 561 But he finds himself in a new role these days , fending off charges that his industry is to blame for despoiling the Chesapeake Bay .
562 872 The usually soft-spoken Perdue will travel to Annapolis on Wednesday to defend his industry at a House of Delegates hearing where lawmakers will take up plans to fight the toxic microbe Pfiesteria piscicida by threatening farmers with sanctions if they do n't limit the amount of manure they use as fertilizer .
873 1209 In a rare hour-and-a-half interview here at Perdue Farms ' corporate headquarters -- a rectangle of offices across the street from the farmhouse where his grandfather , Arthur Perdue , launched what is now the nation 's second-largest poultry company 78 years ago -- the grandson scoffed at suggestions the bay is critically threatened .
1210 1375 He accused Maryland officials of peddling bogus science in proclaiming that chicken manure is washing off the land and fueled last summer 's outbreaks of pfiesteria .
1376 1590 Mostly , he worried about the costs attached to legislation championed by Gov. Parris N. Glendening -LRB- D -RRB- , which would force farmers to do something else with the chicken manure they now use as fertilizer .
1591 1775 Glendening 's bill is being offered at a time when poultry producers across the country are struggling with higher feed prices , sagging exports and competition from lower-priced beef .
1776 1924 Perdue said circumstances in Maryland are particularly dire , because production costs here already are higher than in other regions of the country .
1925 2047 He worried that Glendening 's initiative could push his industry over the edge , forcing it to shift operations elsewhere .
2048 2108 `` There 's a lot of fear and a lot of anxiety , '' he said .
2109 2215 `` If the farmer goes out of business here , we ca n't grow our chickens on the -LRB- Eastern -RRB- Shore .
2216 2278 It 's going to put our plants out of business on the Shore . ''
2279 2555 While even the governor 's economic development secretary has expressed concern that the state 's business reputation may be on the line in the debate over pfiesteria , several trade analysts said talk of major poultry companies packing up and leaving probably is exaggerated .
2556 2738 The integrators like Perdue that process and market the birds `` are n't going to leave Maryland , '' said John C. Bierbusse , a food analyst with A.G. Edwards and Sons in St. Louis .
2739 2858 `` The fixed assets are in place , the growers are there ... You ca n't just pick up a processing plant and move it . ''
2859 2986 But others worry the industry could phase out operations here , spending new capital in places where doing business is cheaper .
2987 3169 `` I 'm not going to build or enlarge a plant here if I 'm not going to be able to do business efficiently , '' said Leonard Teitelbaum , a food analyst at Merrill Lynch in New York .
3170 3233 `` I may keep my old ones , but I wo n't build any new ones . ''
3234 3454 Maryland 's poultry industry dates to the 1920s , when farmers who raised fruits and vegetables for sale in big cities such as Baltimore , Philadelphia and New York opted to add chicken-houses to supplement their income .
3455 3624 The sideline has since matured into an industry that annually produces 300 million chickens worth more than $ 1 billion , exporting the birds as far as Russia and China .
3625 3821 The Perdue family says it is descended from French Huguenots who landed near Assateague Island in the 17th century , subsisting on the timber trade for several centuries before turning to farming .
3822 3963 Given such roots , the modern-day clan leader frowns at suggestions his family 's profitability rests on the right to pollute the Chesapeake .
3964 4001 He calls himself an environmentalist .
4002 4237 `` I drink water out of the ground here , '' said Perdue , who shares the penetrating gaze of his father , Frank Perdue , the man who made the company a household name with ads that bragged it took a tough man to make a tender chicken .
4238 4274 `` I fish in the bay with my son . ''
4275 4419 James Perdue received a doctorate in fisheries from the University of Washington , before returning to Maryland and the family business in 1983 .
4420 4603 He said links between farm pollution and pfiesteria are merely `` circumstantial , '' and he pilloried those who offer the microbe as evidence that the Chesapeake is in mortal danger .
4604 4680 `` This idea of the Chesapeake being a dying bay is ridiculous , '' he said .
4681 4733 `` The bay is in the process of being cleaned up . ''
4734 5010 He was equally dismissive of Glendening 's pfiesteria commission , headed by former governor Harry R. Hughes , which declared that curbing the flow of pollutants in animal manure into tributaries of the Chesapeake Bay was the most promising strategy against the toxic microbe .
5011 5107 He called that finding `` a nothing statement , a ` we-don ' t have-enough-facts ' statement . ''
5108 5267 Perdue especially was critical of Glendening 's decision to pursue mandatory limits on fertilizers , rather than the voluntary program favored by his industry .
5268 5364 He accused Glendening of opting `` to punish farmers , when he ought to pat them on the back . ''
5365 5440 `` If the costs of any one thing goes up , you ca n't survive , '' he said .
