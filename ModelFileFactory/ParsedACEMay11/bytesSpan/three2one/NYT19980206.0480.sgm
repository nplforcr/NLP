Times News Service dLR ; dQC ; dQL ; NAGANO , Japan _ It has been a long time since the Best Games Ever were held _ in Lillehammer , Norway , in February 1994 , if any of us can remember back that far .
490 673 When Juan Antonio Samaranch proclaimed the 1996 T-Shirt Shack Jubilee as the greatest Games ever held in Fulton County , Ga. , the damnation by faint praise did not escape the locals .
674 979 It is a well-known fact that Samaranch , the president of the International Olympic Committee , is so multilingual that he can surely say `` Best Games Ever '' in dozens of African languages , Mandarin and Cantonese , Iroquois , Finnish and Hindi , and is fairly aching to bestow these honors in Japanese .
980 1137 The potentially Best Games Ever were opened Saturday , the closest to the equator the Winter Games have ever been held , in a town allegedly with palm trees .
1138 1232 However , there is more than enough snow on the mountains ringing Almost Heaven , West Nagano .
1233 1516 This prosaic and friendly little city , elevated to Olympic status by the wisdom of the IOC delegates , did its best Saturday on a warm and sunny morning , with a decidedly Japanese touch that included sumo wrestlers , ceremonial wooden pillars , and a real-life emperor and empress .
1517 1776 There was also a shadow hanging over the opening , the threat of a major military action by the United States against Iraq in the next week or two unless there is some resolution to the standoff concerning United Nations inspections of suspected weapon sites .
1777 1900 In the past , Samaranch has made open appeals to `` Please , stop the fighting , '' to whomever was fighting at the moment .
1901 1941 There 's always somebody , is n't there ?
1942 2111 He used whatever cachet the Olympic movement has to call for peace in the former Yugoslavia in 1994 as the Winter Games took place in the peaceful snowy hills of Norway .
2112 2308 Then there were candles flickering along the Storgata , the main street of rustic Lillehammer and intense Norwegians collecting signatures , and Samaranch visited Sarajevo , a sister Olympic city .
2309 2529 However , Baghdad is not an Olympic city , and while Samaranch once again called for peace in the world this morning , he seemed to know he was not going to talk the United States out of doing whatever it is going to do .
2530 2595 `` Our force is limited , as you know , '' Samaranch said Friday .
2596 2647 `` Somebody asked if I contacted President Clinton .
2648 2708 The last time we spoke was during the Atlanta Olympic Games .
2709 2884 President Clinton is a great president , an outstanding politician , and I am sure he will find diplomatic means to convince Iraq 's president to respect international law . ''
2885 3079 In the not-so-distant past , U.S. presidents and Russian presidents and Cuban presidents have deprived their athletes of the chance to compete , in order to make some protest or political stand .
3080 3149 Now Samaranch seemed to be saying , `` Please , stop the politics . ''
3150 3267 He was going to run a sporting event with global ramifications and leave the politics to the bombers and the bombees .
3268 3398 Samaranch may also be fighting a difficult battle against doping _ `` a kind of cheating that we can not afford , '' he called it .
3399 3633 The Chinese seem to be carrying around trunkfuls of performance-enhancing chemicals , most recently to the world swimming championships in Perth , Australia , where their stash was uncovered almost by accident by a customs inspection .
3634 3736 This week Samaranch voiced the hope that customs officials around the world would aid in the struggle .
3737 3837 However , the Olympic movement has a dilemma with its rigid testing for performance-enhancing drugs .
3838 3964 Samaranch has eagerly opened the Games up to wealthy professionals who are not policed particularly strongly in their leagues .
3965 4234 It 's merely a personal disgrace when a Ben Johnson loses his gold medal in the 100 meters for testing positive , but it would be extremely bad business if a basketball or hockey player should test positive for something that is not ordinarily supervised in his league .
4235 4296 Samaranch may have found a battle he can win _ gender equity .
4297 4548 Under his stewardship , the Summer and Winter Games have consistently been opened to female athletes , and this past week he made strong demands for more females , even suggesting minimal quotas , like 10 percent for female officials by the year 2000 .
4549 4647 In the meantime , Samaranch and the spectators could only sit back and enjoy the opening ceremony .
4648 4845 `` I remember coming over the hill and hearing the cheers getting louder , '' recalled Anita DeFrantz , the IOC delegate who won a bronze medal as a rower for the United States in 1976 in Montreal .
4846 4905 `` Then we came into the stadium , and there was a roar . ''
4906 5011 There would be another roar Saturday _ at the start of what everybody hoped would be the Best Games Ever .
5012 5036 It has been a long time .
