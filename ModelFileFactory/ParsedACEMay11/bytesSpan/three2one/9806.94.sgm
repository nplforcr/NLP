Timor Sees Church In Role of Protector ; Catholic Bishop , Indonesian Leader Meet BODY_LEN : 934 VENILALE , Indonesia , June 24 - For one day last week this mountain village in East Timor displayed the kind of social harmony that Indonesia has tried to enforce here during 23 years of military occupation .
417 656 Indonesian military commanders dressed in civilian clothes and wearing awkward smiles joined hands and danced with East Timorese in traditional costumes to celebrate the inauguration of a new wing of the Roman Catholic Sacred Heart Church .
657 758 Venilale 's chief of police and the army commander , both Catholics , sang hymns in the church choir .
759 862 Their subordinates , who are predominantly Muslim , helped fashion the decorations for the celebration .
863 959 `` They make beautiful flowers , '' said Sister Lucia Pereira of the Salesian order in Venilale .
960 1047 That the meeting should have happened in a Catholic church was particularly meaningful .
1048 1252 Under Indonesia 's rule , the Catholic Church in Timor has emerged as a protector of the political opposition in the former Portuguese colony that Indonesia invaded in 1975 and annexed the following year .
1253 1457 Parishes throughout East Timor offer sanctuary for victims of human rights abuses , and church-linked organizations often serve as forums for underground groups seeking to win independence from Indonesia .
1458 1633 Eighty percent of East Timor 's residents are Catholic , while 90 percent of Indonesia 's 200 million people are Muslim -- and less than 3 percent of Indonesians are Catholic .
1634 1869 Bishop Carlos Belo , who has become a de facto president for the East Timorese because of his efforts to end human rights abuses by the military , met with Indonesian President B.J. Habibie today to discuss the status of the territory .
1870 1953 Belo told reporters they talked about an agreement but he declined to give details .
1954 2051 He said the military would withdraw `` little by little '' from the region but gave no timetable .
2052 2233 He also indicated that Habibie 's stated policy toward East Timor was more conciliatory than that of his predecessor , Suharto , who stepped down last month after 32 years in power .
2234 2320 `` He shows himself as a big politician and a big president , '' Belo said of Habibie .
2321 2468 `` He 's ready with his government to improve the situation in East Timor for the better , how to help the people of East Timor live in dignity . ''
2469 2666 Following mounting protests against Indonesian rule , Habibie has proposed a plan that would give the territory a degree of autonomy , except in the areas of finance , foreign affairs and security .
2667 2764 Timorese activists have said that a referendum is the only way to determine the region 's future .
2765 2855 The United Nations still recognizes Portugal as the territory 's administrative authority .
2856 2998 Meetings between Portugal , Indonesia and the United Nations have not resolved East Timor 's status during more than 10 years of negotiations .
2999 3188 The participation of Belo , who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1996 along with self-exiled Timorese leader Jose Ramos-Horta , is key to reaching a solution on East Timor , activists here say .
3189 3344 He is one of the few people Timorese say they trust , even though at times his quick temper can make him appear as autocratic as a man in military uniform .
3345 3441 `` The bishop is like God for them , '' said a Salesian nun in Dili , the East Timorese capital .
3442 3488 `` Everybody goes to him -- the simple people .
3489 3551 If they have an argument over pigs or property they go to him .
3552 3590 Who -LRB- else -RRB- would they go to ?
3591 3602 The police ?
3603 3640 The police are all with the military .
3641 3689 The military ca n't speak '' the local language .
3690 3964 In an apparent effort to bring the military and the local population closer together , a number of Catholic and other Christian Indonesian officers have been appointed to command positions in Venilale , about three hours east of the capital , and elsewhere in the territory .
3965 4086 Sgt. Antonius Karolus , the Indonesian police chief in Venilale , is a Catholic who is active in local church activities .
4087 4194 He lives in the village with his wife and children and said he feels as though he is part of the community .
4195 4218 `` Where would I go ? ''
4219 4227 he said .
4228 4264 `` I 've lived here for 11 years . ''
4265 4384 Timorese remain skeptical of the military 's commitment to foster goodwill through religion and doubt whether it helps .
4385 4455 They say they see Catholic soldiers first and foremost as Indonesians .
4456 4588 `` It is quite different to be an Indonesian Catholic , '' said a human rights worker with the Justice and Peace Commission in Dili .
4589 4663 `` They bring their culture and their nationalism to impose on East Timor .
4664 4766 They are Catholic but they represent Indonesian sovereignty that they want to impose on the people . ''
4767 4863 `` Even Catholic priests from Indonesia -- people will not make confession to them , '' he said .
4864 5049 The soldiers have their own suspicions about the church , in part because several resistance leaders , including Xanana Gusmao , who is in jail , studied at seminaries in the territory .
5050 5220 `` Even the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts in the church , the military says they are being trained for future empowerment , '' said an activist who goes by the name of Vico .
5221 5361 Suharto tried to win the souls of the Timorese a few years ago by making a gift : a massive statue of Jesus on a hill , looking toward Dili .
5362 5473 But when it was unveiled , as Suharto circled in a helicopter , it was revealed to be somewhat of a false idol .
5474 5566 Officials announced that it was 27 meters tall , representing the 27 provinces of Indonesia .
5567 5672 It is 17 meters across , commemorating July 17 , the date on which Indonesia `` integrated '' East Timor .
5673 5843 The foundation is five meters high , representing the five points of pancasilla , the Indonesian state ideology , which promotes religious tolerance , among other tenets .
5844 5917 `` That is how Jesus was born and made by the Indonesians , '' Vico said .
5918 6040 `` His hands are like this , '' he said , stretching out his arms and turning up his palms : `` Surrender to Indonesia . ''
