53 69 I 'm Eddie Mair .
70 92 And I 'm Lisa Mullins .
93 205 One hundred fifty years ago today , a document was published that was to change the political face of the world .
206 314 The Communist Manifesto , written by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels , inspired revolutions across the globe .
315 329 Lenin read it .
330 366 So did Mao Tse-tung and Ho Chi Minh .
367 451 At one stage , a third of the world 's population lived under communist governments .
452 512 But now the great Marxist experiment appears to be in ruins .
513 676 The collapse of the Soviet Union brought down a host of communist regimes , and few nations these days aspire to anything other than a thriving capitalist economy .
677 701 But Marxism is not dead .
702 950 To discuss how the ideas of the Communist Manifesto are interpreted these days , we turn to Alexei Pushkoff , political columnist with The Independent in Moscow , and Richard Sakwa , professor of Russian politics at Kent University here in Britain .
951 1036 According to Sakwa , the Communist Manifesto still communicates revolutionary fervor .
1037 1336 It 's a phenomenally powerful message Marx is putting forwards , the idea that the last revolutionary class will put an end to exploitation entirely , and it 's this vision of human emancipation ultimately which is more important than even his ideas about political economy and all the other things .
1337 1495 But yet , despite his enormous faults , he still had this message of human emancipation , and it 's this which gave Marx and Marxism its power over the years .
1496 1541 What is the central message of the Manifesto ?
1542 1648 Most people can quote a line or two from it , but if you were to identify the central thrust , what is it ?
1649 1873 The opening lines of the Communist Manifesto , which talks about the emergence of communism as a organized force , the history of all the hitherto existing societies , he says , is the history of class struggles , and so on .
1874 2040 The idea of huge capital , all you have to do , Marx would say , is to get rid of a few capitalists and then people could take over and manage their lives themselves .
2041 2263 Alexei Pushkoff , w - when you look at marxism in practice , you look at China branching out now as a free market economy , you look at Cuba , looking for outside investors , and of course the collapse of the Soviet Union .
2264 2307 Should we conclude that marxism has failed ?
2308 2828 Well , I think marxism has definitely failed as a political experiment and as a social experiment , but marxism has not failed as a social theory and uh as a a way of thinking because marxism , to my mind , if we take th - the general mythology of marxism , which is much more primitive than his theories , w - what it basically says is that the capitalist society is not just , that there should be a better society , and that there are certain ways by which the capitalist society can be changed into a better society .
2829 2945 I think this idea is still very popular not only in the third world but also e - even in Western European countries .
2946 3120 So I think that Marx has not failed as a way of thinking , as a theory which pictures the alternative to the existing society , with which many people will always be unhappy .
3121 3209 And in this way , I think we will carry Marx with us well into the twenty-first century .
3210 3300 The New Yorker Magazine recently pronounced the world 's next big thinker to be Karl Marx .
3301 3457 They argue that he was way ahead in his views on globalization , that he predicted that economics and not politics would be the driving force in the future .
3458 3514 Was Marx just a man ahead of his time , Alexei Pushkoff ?
3515 3630 Well , I think that Marx was both very much rooted in his time , and of course he was a visionary at the same time .
3631 3694 I think th - this very combination makes his message so strong .
3695 3789 I guess h - he was actually looking into the future , which was supposed to be very far ahead .
3790 3864 I would say over th - the uh experience which Russia , for instance , had .
3865 3909 He was looking in the twenty-second century .
3910 4029 You know , he was bypassing all such small details for him as the practical organization of a , of a communist society .
4030 4362 We have experienced this practical organization , we know what it is , we know that uh bureaucracy has become the main driving force uh of the society , w - we know that terror has uh become one of the main instruments of controlling the people , but when it comes to realities , I think that Marx was uh much more wrong than right .
4363 4586 He never understood uh that even when economic forces dominate the general flow of human development , there is still place for an individual , there is still place for civil rights , there is still place for a personality .
4587 4795 Richard Sakwa , is it possible that perhaps in a hundred and fifty years ' time , maybe sooner , uh my successor will be sitting asking your successor about what an enormous success Marx has been in practice ?
4796 4821 I - I doubt it very much .
4822 4844 It 's a good question .
4845 5000 I wonder though , sometimes , whether in a hundred and fifty or two hundred years , whether , when the question is asked , they 'd say , Marx , who was he ?
5001 5428 Some , perhaps not a utopian thinker , certainly an important social thinker of the mid nineteenth century whose ideas were taken up in uh certain peripheral countries , the third world , uh Russia , uh eastern Europe , in a different way , China , but he forgot the politics , he forgot that people are involved in it , so , quite clearly , it does n't have much to say about the relationship between the markets and politics .
5429 5498 He tended to reduce politics to economics , and that was quite false .
5499 5550 Thank you both for helping us mark the anniversary .
5551 5723 Richard Sakwa , professor of Russian and European politics at Kent University in England , and Alexei Pushkoff , political columnist at The Independent newspaper in Moscow .
5724 5748 Many thanks to you both .
