560 653 MALAYSIA 'S aggressive move into the information age could not come in a more opportune time .
654 970 With the convergence of communications and information technologies -LRB- IT -RRB- coupled with the coming of age for the Internet and its related technologies , the stage is set for Malaysians to seize the chance to transform into a knowledge society and become worthy opponents\/players in the global market space .
971 1302 The Internet , the global network of computers , is now far reaching into the country - extending its embrace to include every nook and cranny of the nation - opening doors to not only a diverse range of information sources but also an exhaustive list of possibilities to create new applications which add value to people 's lives .
1303 1472 In the business world , the Internet - through intranet and extranet solutions - has become an invaluable tool for companies to harness so as to gain a competitive edge .
1473 1688 The solutions are also vital components in developing the borderless marketing flagship application which is a vital element for spearheading the development of the Multimedia Super Corridor -LRB- MSC -RRB- project .
1689 1841 The application will create the necessary framework and infrastructure to support electronic commerce -LRB- e-commerce -RRB- initiatives in the country .
1842 1986 However , it is important to note that installing or implementing Internet technologies for technology 's sake would not ensure instant success .
1987 2232 For e-commerce to flourish with full-blown end-to-end business transactions , strategic planning which incorporates both business and technology plans that are complementary is necessary for an organization to see feasible returns on investment .
2233 2389 Intranets , through the use of Internet technology , are positioned as a platform for companies to optimise , expand and transform new channels of business .
2390 2543 When strategically implemented , an intranet solution will provide the ability to mediate mission-critical , decision support functions in organizations .
2544 2644 It will also help further improve communications and collaboration at all levels in an organization .
2645 2811 With intranets in place , it is only logical for organizations to respectively link the network to other companies ' for extended business purposes through extranets .
2812 3086 While this will enable the sharing of information among enterprises , security issues such as firewalls and encryption as well as access and control procedures , and the trust levels that enterprises have with each other will emerge and there will be a need to address them .
3087 3191 Other than usage in business , Internet technology is also beginning to infiltrate the lifestyle domain .
3192 3316 `` Smart homes '' have emerged bringing a wealth of information and entertainment to families over telecommunications lines .
3317 3480 The art of socialising is also experiencing a change where Net\/virtual relationships are fast overtaking or becoming parallel with the normal human relationships .
3481 3576 Whether this would prove positive or otherwise towards society in the future is yet to be seen .
3577 3622 All in all , the Internet has a lot to offer .
3623 3690 However , its value and benefits are only as good as how we use it .
