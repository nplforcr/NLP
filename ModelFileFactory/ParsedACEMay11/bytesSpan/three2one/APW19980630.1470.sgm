596 779 As President Bill Clinton swings through China , leaders in Tokyo are watching from the sidelines and beginning to worry that their biggest neighbor may be stealing their best friend .
780 868 And , in the middle of its worst recession since World War II , Japan needs that friend .
869 1027 China has always weighed heavily on the Japanese mind , but Clinton 's decision not to visit Japan on his way back has generated a good deal of fretting here .
1028 1181 Japanese newspaper editorials have written ominously of `` the new U.S.-China era '' and `` America and China 's new partnership for the 21st Century . ''
1182 1379 To make matters worse , Clinton on Tuesday pointedly praised China 's leaders for their role in keeping Asia 's financial crisis from getting out of hand , calling China a `` force of stability . ''
1380 1442 He then prodded Japan to do more to boost its laggard economy .
1443 1489 For Japan , there is more at stake than pride .
1490 1724 Experts have long predicted that it could be just a matter of time before China 's steady march toward free-market liberalization and increased democracy will make the world 's most populous nation the dominant economic power in Asia .
1725 1906 To many here , Clinton 's overtures toward China are more proof that the United States and other countries are increasingly eager to throw in their lot with Asia 's awakening giant .
1907 2019 `` The Japanese should be worried , '' said Gregory Clark , a professor of politics at Tokyo 's Tama University .
2020 2126 `` We could be back in the 1930s where America had to choose between Japan and China _ and chose China . ''
2127 2294 Clark acknowledged that while the United States ' foreign policy in Asia has for decades focused on its ties with Japan , it has been careful to keep its options open .
2295 2370 But now , he said , Washington is `` beginning to play the other option . ''
2371 2579 Playing the other option could mean stepping up efforts to turn China into a major trading partner , a move that would boost China 's economy and help it challenge Japan 's pre-eminent position in the region .
2580 2758 Closer U.S.-China ties could also lead China to rely more on the United States for its infrastructure needs , squeezing out Japanese companies that have long done business there .
2759 2885 Still , not all experts agree Clinton 's visit to China necessarily heralds a significant shift in the Asian balance of power .
2886 3007 Many analysts say that while Japan 's international standing is low now , it will revive as soon as the economy picks up .
3008 3139 That economy , they note , still dwarfs that of China , and the U.S.-Japan military alliance remains crucial to regional stability .
3140 3189 Nearly 50,000 U.S. troops are stationed in Japan .
3190 3318 `` Japan is still America 's closest ally in terms of security , '' said Shigenori Okazaki , a political analyst at SBC Warburg .
3319 3387 `` In terms of the security arrangement , China is no comparison . ''
3388 3460 Much of the problem Japan is having with Clinton 's visit is its timing .
3461 3651 The visit comes as Japan is struggling to come out from under a tidal wave of international criticism _ much of it from the United States _ over its fumbled attempts to get out of recession .
3652 3833 But Japan also still holds bad memories of the `` Nixon shock , '' when , without prior consultations with Tokyo , President Richard Nixon made his historic trek to Beijing in 1972 .
3834 3975 The United States has scrambled to allay fears that Clinton 's overtures to China mean Washington is downgrading its relationship with Japan .
3976 4181 U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will visit Tokyo this week to smooth any ruffled feathers , and on Tuesday , America 's ambassador to Japan , Thomas Foley , went out of his way to be reassuring .
4182 4348 `` I am a bit puzzled that warmer U.S.-China ties -LRB- are seen by some to -RRB- somehow undermine the U.S.-Japan relationship , '' Foley said at a luncheon Tuesday .
