0 501 9801.266 NEWS STORY SOURCE : The Washington Post SECTION : A01 LENGTH : 961 DATE : January 17 , 1998 HEADLINE : Holocaust Museum Denies Arafat an Official Welcome ; Palestinian Chief 's Visit Would Have Been First to Exhibition by Major Arab Leader BODY_LEN : 926 Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat , persuaded by the Clinton administration peace team to pay a groundbreaking visit to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum next week , angrily canceled the plan after museum officials rebuffed his overture .
502 783 Conceived as a gesture of reconciliation by U.S. deputy special Mideast envoy Aaron Miller , Arafat 's visit would have been the first to the exhibition on Nazi genocide by a major Arab leader and a highly symbolic acknowledgment of the defining event of the century for many Jews .
784 947 By the time plans for the visit had fallen apart yesterday , the episode had become the latest irritant in the faltering talks between Israel and the Palestinians .
948 1164 Arafat is coming to Washington for talks on Thursday with President Clinton , who will also meet Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu next week in an effort to inject new urgency into their stalled negotiations .
1165 1481 Miller and his superior , Dennis Ross , both of whom serve on the panel that functions as the Holocaust museum 's board of directors , suggested the visit to Arafat through intermediaries after believing they had won the consent of Miles Lerman , a death camp survivor who chairs the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council .
1482 1738 But museum sources said members of the American Jewish community warned Lerman and museum Director Walter Reich that `` this -LRB- Arafat -RRB- is Hitler incarnate , '' as one official put it , and must not be welcomed in the memorial to Hitler 's victims .
1739 1959 When Lerman and Reich informed Arafat he could visit the museum only as an individual , without the special measures for security and protocol routinely accorded world leaders , Arafat struck the visit from his schedule .
1960 2272 Lerman , reached at his New Jersey home , said the subject of Arafat and Israel 's talks with the Palestinian Authority still profoundly divided U.S. and world Jewry and `` we believe the museum should not get involved in a political dispute where half of the people are for something and half are against it . ''
2273 2496 `` If and when the day will come when peace will be established between the state of Israel and the Palestinians then we will be more than happy to receive Arafat as a leader and celebrate that achievement , '' Lerman said .
2497 2617 Among Arafat 's advisers , ever sensitive to loss of face , a tightly restrained sense of grievance prevailed yesterday .
2618 2792 `` We did n't create this idea , '' Nabil Abu Irdineh , who notified Arafat of the snub late Thursday night , said in a telephone interview from the West Bank city of Nablus .
2793 2808 `` He said yes .
2809 2829 They are saying no. .
2830 2854 It 's as simple as that .
2855 2989 We have been extending our hands since the days of -LRB- Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak -RRB- Rabin , and our hands are still slapped .
2990 3030 Somebody is still living in the past . ''
3031 3253 Lerman and museum spokeswoman Mary Morrison emphasized that the federally funded memorial can not lawfully turn away any individual and would make no attempt to do so if Arafat simply turned up at the popular tourist draw .
3254 3341 `` The doors are open from 10 in the morning to 5:30 in the afternoon , '' Lerman said .
3342 3596 But Lerman also added that the museum would not extend Arafat the formal courtesies that are routine for other world leaders , and museum officials said they well understood that withholding special coordination effectively rendered the visit impossible .
3597 3704 `` You 're obviously not going to have Yasser Arafat standing in line to get a pass , '' one official said .
3705 3821 Arafat and his aides had approached the visit gingerly , according to several people directly involved in the plans .
3822 4092 Competing self-images of victimhood have long prevented Israelis and Arabs from acknowledging the full weight of each other 's historical tragedies , and many Arab leaders have resisted efforts to lure them to the museum and the similar Yad Vashem memorial in Jerusalem .
4093 4377 Miller and Ross felt strongly , according to officials familiar with their views , that a quiet visit to the memorial could mark a psychological breakthrough for skeptical Jews and help Arafat understand the fears of an adversary he has experienced primarily as a regional superpower .
4378 4703 Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright , her spokesman James P. Rubin said in an interview yesterday , routinely encourages world leaders to visit the memorial but `` with regard to Chairman Arafat , it is particularly important that he visit because the horrors of the Holocaust were a defining event in Jewish history . ''
4704 4885 Among those who helped overcome the Palestinian leader 's initial concerns were former congressman Wayne Owens , who heads the Center for Middle East Peace and Economic Cooperation .
4886 5103 Owens participated in a conference call last week with Mohammed Rasheed , a key aide to Arafat , and sent a memo , he said , arguing that `` it would be a nice symbolic thing for him to do , an appropriate gesture . ''
5104 5291 Hani Masri , a Palestinian American businessman who often represents Arafat informally in Washington , said he told Arafat all the arguments of Miller and Ross `` and Arafat said fine . ''
5292 5467 `` I thought we should concentrate on positive things , '' Masri said , `` and having him be the first Arab leader to visit the museum would bring our communities together . ''
5468 5543 But Thursday night , Lerman told Masri that the museum would not cooperate .
5544 5658 `` Hani called me at home , he 's almost crying , '' said another former official who played an intermediary role .
5659 5795 An Arab diplomat in Washington familiar with the episode , said , `` It shows that some people have not got over their complexes yet . ''
5796 5842 Associates of Arafat described him as furious .
5843 5894 Lerman , for his part , said he intended no slight .
5895 6025 `` I would be heartbroken if the peace process fell apart , '' he said , emphasizing that he spoke for himself and not the museum .
6026 6117 `` Arafat is the leader of the Palestinian people , and I believe he is trying his best . ''
