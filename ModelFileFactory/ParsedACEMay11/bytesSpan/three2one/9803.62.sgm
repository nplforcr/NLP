0 315 9803.62 NEWS STORY SOURCE : The Washington Post SECTION : E01 LENGTH : 688 DATE : March 27 , 1998 HEADLINE : U.S. May Fight Murdoch-MCI Satellite Plan ; Justice Staff Said to Oppose Merging of TV Operations BODY_LEN : 631 Government antitrust officials are taking aim at Rupert Murdoch 's latest highflying venture .
316 631 After almost eight months of investigation , the Justice Department is preparing to challenge a plan by Murdoch 's News Corp. and MCI Communications Corp. to merge their U.S. satellite TV operations with Primestar Partners , the nation 's second-largest satellite TV company , sources familiar with the inquiry say .
632 786 The department 's telecommunications staff will recommend soon that the merger be blocked outright or substantially modified , according to these sources .
787 989 Although such a recommendation does n't guarantee that the government will sue to stop Murdoch-MCI and Primestar , it reflects deep-seated concerns by staff experts about the pending $ 1.1 billion deal .
990 1079 `` The staff would like to stop this , '' said a source , who asked not to be identified .
1080 1184 `` It 'll be a lot tougher to explain a decision not to do something than a decision to challenge it . ''
1185 1442 As Primestar is partly owned by four large cable TV companies , Justice officials are worried that Primestar will use the powerful Murdoch-MCI satellite operations to harm competing satellite TV companies and preserve the cable industry 's market dominance .
1443 1615 District-based MCI and News Corp. , through a joint venture called American Sky Broadcasting , own a choice orbital `` slot , '' essentially a parking space in outer space .
1616 1688 MCI bought the slot for $ 682.5 million at a government auction in 1996 .
1689 1863 The slot is highly valuable because it is one of only three available in this country from which a satellite can beam TV programs across most of North America simultaneously .
1864 1976 The other two slots are being used by Primestar 's competitors , DirecTV Inc. and Echostar Communications Corp. .
1977 2101 American Sky Broadcasting agreed in June to transfer its slot to Primestar for $ 1.1 billion in preferred , nonvoting stock .
2102 2242 The Justice Department 's lengthy review of the deal is already threatening to scuttle Primestar 's plans to launch a satellite this summer .
2243 2386 The company has been hoping to use the satellite and the MCI-News Corp. slot to enable its subscribers to begin using 18-inch receiving dishes .
2387 2452 Primestar customers now use dishes that are 33 to 36 inches wide .
2453 2657 The company believes moving to the smaller dish , now used by DirecTV and Echostar 's Dish Network , will allow it to gain more subscribers in urban and suburban areas where larger dishes are impractical .
2658 2793 `` It is important for Primestar to get this issue resolved soon , '' said Daniel J. O'Brien , Primestar 's president , in a statement .
2794 2967 `` We 'll continue to work to provide the government with the information they need to render a decision , and we 're still hopeful for a positive outcome , '' O'Brien said .
2968 3251 A long list of opponents to the deal has emerged , including DirecTV , Echostar , small cable operators , companies that use microwaves to send TV signals to subscribers and regional phone companies Bell South Corp. and Ameritech Corp. , which are trying to enter the cable business .
3252 3523 Critics argue that Primestar could potentially hurt them in one of two key ways : by withholding popular cable programming the Primestar partners own , or by marketing `` bundled '' cable and satellite TV service at a price that would substantially undersell competitors .
3524 3665 Sources close to Primestar say these concerns are misplaced , and safeguards could easily be put in place even if there was a potential harm .
3666 3847 Blocking the deal , they argue , would ultimately harm consumers by denying them services Primestar could provide , and would place the valuable Murdoch-MCI satellite slot in limbo .
3848 4000 The Federal Communications Commission is conducting a separate review of the Primestar-Murdoch-MCI combination , and is likely to rule on it next month .
4001 4148 The FCC must determine whether the deal is in `` the public interest , '' a somewhat hazily defined standard that gives the agency wide discretion .
4149 4281 Primestar 's largest shareholder is TCI Satellite Entertainment , a publicly traded spinoff of cable giant Tele-Communications Inc. .
4282 4390 Other cable industry owners include Time Warner Inc. , MediaOne , Comcast Corp. and Cox Communications Inc. .
