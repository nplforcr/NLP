0 560 9804.204 NEWS STORY SOURCE : The Washington Post SECTION : F01 LENGTH : 883 DATE : April 17 , 1998 HEADLINE : Host Marriott to Buy Hotels , Form REIT ; Firm Also to Spin Off Nursing Homes BODY_LEN : 871 Judith Evans , Washington Post Staff Writer Host Marriott Corp. , the Bethesda-based hotel owner , will announce today that it will pay $ 1.7 billion to buy 13 luxury hotels from Blackstone Real Estate Advisors II L.P. , spin off its nursing homes into a separately traded public company and convert its hotel operations into a real estate investment trust .
561 715 Host 's purchase includes such highly prized properties as the Drake Hotel in New York City , the Ritz-Carlton Amelia Island and the Hyatt Regency Reston .
716 960 The aim of Host Marriott 's reorganization is to cash in on Wall Street 's fascination with REITs , broadening the appeal of the company 's shares among investors who in the past had been cool to the stock , said sources familiar with the deal .
961 1153 As a REIT , Host Marriott will have better access to less expensive financing and a lower tax bill , because it will pay out nearly all of its profits to shareholders in the form of dividends .
1154 1201 Shareholders then pay the taxes on that income .
1202 1329 The REIT form of corporate structure has recently become a popular way for hotel companies to own and operate their properties .
1330 1485 The Blackstone purchase will give Host 55,000 rooms , or $ 10 billion in assets , compared with 26,000 rooms when it first became a public company in 1993 .
1486 1700 More importantly , sources said , the quality of the company 's hotels will improve , with nearly 55 percent of its properties considered luxury , full-service hotels , compared with only 20 percent five years ago .
1701 1787 Officials from Marriott and Blackstone would not comment on the transaction yesterday .
1788 1862 Host Marriott 's moves also mark a significant turnaround for the company .
1863 1980 It was spun off in 1993 as a separate company from Marriott International Inc. , which now builds and manages hotels .
1981 2194 At the time , investors and analysts were skittish about Host because the company carried massive debt and had divergent operations , including running food and beverage concessions for airports and travel plazas .
2195 2322 Host Marriott in 1995 shed the concessions business , which now operates as a publicly traded company , Host Marriott Services .
2323 2440 In the past five years , the company has reduced its ratio of debt to its total market to 47 percent from 75 percent .
2441 2573 The company 's strategy is to improve that to 35 percent by refinancing debt at lower interest rates through a conversion to a REIT .
2574 2745 The complex deal calls for Host Marriott to pay $ 835 million in cash and debt , as well as 47 million operating partnership units in the REIT , for the Blackstone hotels .
2746 2822 Blackstone will own about 19 percent of Host Marriott 's outstanding shares .
2823 2912 John Schreiber , a partner in Blackstone , will join Host Marriott 's board of directors .
2913 3069 Shareholders can exchange the partnership shares for one share of Host Marriott common stock , at which time they will have to pay taxes on the transaction .
3070 3260 But sources familiar with the deal said that in 1999 , it will add 26 cents a share on an estimated $ 800 million in funds from operations , a key measure of financial performance for REITs .
3261 3349 Analysts had estimated Host Marriott would generate earnings of $ 2.15 a share for 1999 .
3350 3425 Host Marriott expects to complete its conversion to a REIT by January 1999 .
3426 3539 The deal is subject to shareholder approval , even though it will have no effect on the existing stock ownership .
3540 3676 But as part of spinning off the senior living communities , Host Marriott will repurchase $ 1.55 billion of outstanding debt securities .
3677 3878 In the new senior living company , which has yet to be named , Host Marriott shareholders will receive one share of stock for each share they now hold and a cash distribution of as much as $ 1 a share .
3879 3983 It is a taxable transaction that Host Marriott estimates will range from $ 400 million to $ 500 million .
3984 4069 The company hopes the cash will help shareholders cover the taxes on the transaction .
4070 4203 The new company will own 31 luxury retirement facilities in 12 states , mostly those built and constructed by Marriott International .
4204 4427 Analysts had expected Host Marriott to join a cadre of hospitality companies forming REITs , including CapStar Hotel Co. , which announced last month that it will merge with American General into a `` paper-clipped '' REIT .
4428 4694 The Clinton administration in January proposed eliminating the tax-free status of mergers between `` paired-shared '' REITs after industry criticism that that status helped Starwood Hotels d Lodging beat out the competition in purchasing ITT Corp. and Westin Hotels .
4695 4803 A paired-shared REIT operates and manages properties in a C corporation and a REIT , which trade separately .
4804 4845 A paper-clipped REIT trades as one stock .
4846 5031 The `` paper clipped '' REIT and Host 's conversion to an `` umbrella partnership '' REIT are less controversial structures in the industry and among lawmakers than paired-shared REITs .
5032 5198 Host Marriott 's REIT will allow its stock to trade at a higher value , allowing the company to use its stock to bid more for properties , several analysts have said .
5199 5328 The company will also be more attractive to sellers because they can receive Host Marriott stock in exchange for the real estate .
5329 5459 `` It fits very cleanly '' for Host Marriott to become a REIT , said Mark Mutkoski , a lodging analyst for Bankers Trust New York .
5460 5573 `` They have proven in the past that they can acquire properties for a good price and improve their cash flow . ''
5574 5574 .
