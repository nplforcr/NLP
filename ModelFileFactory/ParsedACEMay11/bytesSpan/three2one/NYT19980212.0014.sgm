248 521 dLR ; dQL ; -LRB- mk -RRB- dQL ; dUR ; By SETH SCHIESEL dQC ; dLR ; dQL ; dUR ; c. 1998 N.Y. Times News Service dQC ; dLR ; dQL ; A U.S. judge in Texas Wednesday temporarily stayed his year-end decision that invalidated major portions of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 .
522 871 Wednesday 's action keeps the telecommunications industry in the regulatory status it had before Dec. 31 , when Judge Joe Kendall of the U.S. District Court in Wichita Falls , Texas , ruled that local Bell telephone companies should be allowed to sell long-distance service without passing a rigorous review by the Federal Communications Commission .
872 1088 That process was the cornerstone of the act , and in ruling the portions forcing the review unconstitutional , the judge threw into question the entire structure of telecommunications regulation in the United States .
1089 1317 Now , the Bells , which had hoped to offer long distance early this year , must abide by the language of the act until the judge 's original decision is considered by courts of appeal _ a process that could take months or years .
1318 1486 The act says that the Bells , because of their history as part of ATdAMP ; T Corp. , must win special approvals from the FCC before they may sell long-distance service .
1487 1517 No Bell has won such approval .
1518 1679 Other large local phone companies , however , like GTE Corp. , are allowed to enter the $ 80 billion long-distance market without passing such a rigorous review .
1680 1898 In December , Kendall ruled that the act violated the Constitution by essentially convicting the Bells _ Ameritech , Bell Atlantic , BellSouth , SBC Communications and US West _ of antitrust violations without a trial .
1899 1960 But Wednesday the judge stayed the decision , pending appeal .
1961 2119 The FCC , along with ATdAMP ; T and MCI Communications Corp. , has petitioned the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals , based in New Orleans , to hear the case .
2120 2266 Lawyers involved in the case said Wednesday that they did not expect the appeals court to hear arguments in the dispute for at least a few months .
2267 2371 The lawyers also said that it was unusual that Kendall did not explain his reason for granting the stay .
2372 2494 The big long-distance companies had argued that they would suffer irreparably were the decision allowed to go into effect .
2495 2672 `` The Bell monopolies must still comply with the requirements of the telecom act before they can enter the highly competitive long-distance market , '' MCI said in a statement .
2673 2768 `` Obviously we 're pleased that he granted the stay , '' added Peter Lucht , an MCI spokesman .
2769 2867 SBC Communications , the Bell that originally filed the lawsuit , played down Wednesday 's action .
2868 2951 `` The order granting the stay is not unusual , '' the company said in a statement .
2952 3056 ` The appeals process will be resolved quickly , and we are confident that the ruling will be upheld . ''
3057 3163 Kendall declined to issue an injunction specifically barring the Bells from selling long-distance service .
3164 3256 But the stay essentially keeps the Bells out of the long-distance market for the time being .
3257 3438 Even as he granted the stay , Kendall stood by his original decision , which he said was important to maintain the separation of powers among the branches of the federal government .
3439 3611 `` Despite all the noise , spin and reams of papers , legally this case is n't so much about Milt Friedman vs. Kenneth Galbraith as it is about James Madison , '' he wrote .
3612 3778 Friedman is a free-market economist , while John Kenneth Galbraith is an economist who generally sees a more positive role for government intervention in the economy .
