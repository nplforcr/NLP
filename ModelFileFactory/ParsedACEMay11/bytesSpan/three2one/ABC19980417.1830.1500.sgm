1151 1272 He is paid to watch TV tapes of every NASCAR race and keep track of every second a sponsor 's logo appears on television .
1273 1329 So this sign here and this sign here and this sign here ?
1330 1367 Yes , as well as what 's on the hood .
1368 1601 Bob 's calculations are published in something called the sponsors report , which tells each sponsor the total time its logo was seen on TV during a race and compares the total to the cost of a television commercial in the same race .
1602 1718 For example , in this race , the report claims Valvoline got twenty eight minutes and seventeen seconds of exposure .
1719 1781 That is worth over four hundred seventy five thousand dollars .
