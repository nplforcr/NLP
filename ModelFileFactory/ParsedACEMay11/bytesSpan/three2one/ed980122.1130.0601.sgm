0 162 ed980122 .1130.0601 NEWS STORY Prostate cancer will kill an estimated forty thousand men this year in the US , early detection playing a key role in saving lives .
163 226 Al Hinman now reports on a new method that may do a better job .
227 294 Jack Markey got a big surprise when he recently turned seventy-six .
295 375 Well , the discovery of the problem came on my birthday , December twenty-ninth .
376 409 At that time I was passing blood .
410 509 Doctors discovered cancer in Markey 's prostate even though he 'd passed his twice a year checkups .
510 676 In fact , today 's most widely used and accepted method of screening for prostate cancer , the PSA blood test , failed to give Markey and his urologist early warning .
677 758 The big dilemma is that you can still have prostate cancer and have a normal PSA .
759 908 But now , researchers believe there may be a better way to predict which men are at greatest risk for prostate cancer and may need closer monitoring .
909 1085 Researchers at Harvard University believe measuring levels of an essential human growth hormone , called IGF one , may help predict a man 's odds of developing prostate cancer .
1086 1290 We found that men in the highest twenty-fifth percentile of IGF one levels appeared to have about four times the risk of developing prostate cancer , compared to men in the lowest twenty-fifth percentile .
1291 1433 The Harvard researchers say more study 's needed before doctors should start measuring IGF one hormone levels to predict prostate cancer risk .
1434 1566 And , they hope , additional research may also provide a way to prevent prostate cancer by controlling levels of the growth hormone .
1567 1643 That may prove as easy as cutting the fat in diets or getting more exercise .
