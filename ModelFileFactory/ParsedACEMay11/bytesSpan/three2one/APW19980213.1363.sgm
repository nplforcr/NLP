''
467 701 Riyadh al-Qaysi picked his way through Berger 's press conference in Washington hours earlier , criticizing the security advisor 's assertion that Iraq had been repeatedly in `` material breach '' of U.N. Security Council resolutions .
702 845 `` Iraq challenges -LRB- Berger -RRB- to produce one Security Council resolution using those two words , '' al-Qaysi told reporters in Baghdad .
846 1066 He said that Berger might not have been concerned with reality , because he had indicated that if the United States did not have the Security Council 's unanimous support for a military strike , it would go ahead anyway .
1067 1390 `` Everybody knows that under the charter of the United Nations , the five permanent members have a special responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security and there are three permanent members _ namely Russia , France and China _ who do not want war , so unanimity does not exist , '' al-Qaysi said .
1391 1475 The deputy foreign minister accused Berger of being part of a campaign against Iraq .
1476 1634 `` This campaign is being conducted on the basis of lies and deception and should not be taken by anyone in the world as being a justifiable basis for war . ''
1635 1741 `` This is exactly what the United States , as supported by the United Kingdom , are trying to achieve . ''
1742 1902 Al-Qaysi took issue with Berger 's saying that any U.S. strike would be aimed at eliminating `` the threat of the use of weapons of mass destruction by Iraq . ''
1903 2126 Berger `` considers UNSCOM to be the body responsible for making such a determination , '' he said , referring to the U.N. Special Commission whose inspectors are charged with searching for Iraq 's mass destruction weapons .
2127 2333 `` To my mind , and to that of my government , UNSCOM has not made any reference to an existing threat , as of now , by Iraq against its neighbors on account of the existence of weapons of mass destruction .
2334 2371 Its reports indicate the contrary . ''
2372 2543 Al-Qaysi also criticized British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook for saying earlier this week that Iraq posed a threat because it still possessed weapons of mass destruction .
2544 2585 `` Nothing can be further from the truth .
2586 2622 He should check UNSCOM 's report . ''
2623 2922 Referring to the U.S. and British threat to attack Iraq if it does not give unfettered access to U.N. inspectors , whom Baghdad has barred from a number of suspected weapons sites on grounds of national sovereignty , al-Qaysi said the two powers were not seeking to reinforce the Special Commission .
2923 2954 `` The objective is not UNSCOM .
2955 3004 The objective is to use military force per se . ''
3005 3184 The deputy foreign minister spelled out the location of the eight presidential sites that Iraq has offered to open up to inspectors appointed by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan .
3185 3468 He said three of the sites were in Baghdad , three were Salah-Eddine -LRB- an area near Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein 's home town of Tikrit , north of Baghdad -RRB- , one was in the northern region of Ninawa -LRB- also known as Mosul -RRB- , and one was in the southern city of Basra .
3469 3547 It was first time that a senior Iraqi official had identified the eight sites .
