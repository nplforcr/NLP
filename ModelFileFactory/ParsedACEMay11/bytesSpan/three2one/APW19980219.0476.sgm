536 789 Gen. Nhek Bunchhay , a loyalist of ousted Cambodian Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh , said in an interview with The Associated Press at his hilltop headquarters that he hopes to recover the remains of Christopher Howes within the next two weeks .
790 934 Howes had been working for the Britain-based Mines Advisory Group when he was abducted with his Cambodian interpreter Houn Hourth in March 1996 .
935 984 There were many conflicting accounts of his fate .
985 1168 Howes ' team was clearing mines 17 kilometers -LRB- 10 miles -RRB- from Angkor Wat , the fabled 11th century temple that is Cambodia 's main tourist attraction , when it was attacked .
1169 1313 In January this year , British police officers who had been searching for Howes concluded he had probably been killed soon after being captured .
1314 1492 The Foreign Office said it had informed the family of Howes , 37 years old when he was kidnapped , that he probably died within weeks or months of his capture on March 26 , 1996 .
1493 1597 `` Obviously , it is deeply discouraging for the family after 22 months , but there is no proof of life .
1598 1755 But there is no evidence in either direction _ that there is proof of life or death , '' said a Foreign Office spokesman , speaking with customary anonymity .
1756 1834 `` We will continue to do everything we can to establish what has happened . ''
1835 2074 Thai military officials who monitor Cambodian affairs said privately Thursday that Britain , through its embassies in Thailand and Cambodia , has been pushing hard to resolve the Howes case as the second anniversary of his abduction nears .
2075 2270 Nhek Bunchhay , who had been closely involved in the search for Howes before having to flee the Cambodian capital after a coup d'etat last year , appeared confident he would find Howes ' remains .
2271 2489 He said he received information from Khmer Rouge guerrillas on where the body had been buried , and recently ordered 10 of his men from a force of 500 near Khmer Rouge headquarters in Anlong Veng to conduct the search .
2490 2679 If and when the remains are found , he said , they would be turned over to the British Embassy , apparently meaning they would be sent across the border into Thailand and onward to Bangkok .
2680 2845 Nhek Bunchhay said he now believed Howes had been killed within a week of his capture by a Khmer Rouge faction loyal to Pol Pot , then the guerrilla group 's leader .
2846 3019 Pol Pot is considered responsible for the radical policies that led to the deaths of as many as 1.7 million Cambodians when the communist group held power in the late 1970s .
3020 3149 At the time Howes was captured , the Khmer Rouge were a more or less united guerrilla force with more than 10,000 men under arms .
3150 3254 But the group began to fall apart in mid-1996 after the defection of one of its top leaders , Ieng Sary .
3255 3317 Other commanders , and thousands of guerrillas , followed him .
3318 3456 A small hardcore group under Pol Pot continued to hold out at their headquarters at Anlong Veng in northern Cambodia near the Thai border .
3457 3551 But in June last year , the remaining leadership had a falling out , and Pol Pot was arrested .
3552 3724 In July last year in Phnom Penh , Cambodia 's capital , Second Prime Minister Hun Sen staged a successful coup d'etat against First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh .
3725 3842 Ranariddh 's loyalists , including Nhek Bunchhay , his top military commander , went into hiding or fled the capital .
3843 3967 Nhek Bunchhay , evading an intensive manhunt , made his way to O'Smach , the last major outpost held by Ranariddh 's forces .
3968 4123 His men have held the stronghold _ which is on the border just opposite the Thai province of Surin _ against repeated intense attacks by Hun Sen 's troops .
4124 4604 They have been aided by Khmer Rouge guerrillas from Anlong Veng , who have formed an alliance with Ranariddh 's resistance forces to oppose Hun Sen. -LRB- PROFILE -LRB- WS SL : BC-Cambodia-Britain-Hostage ; CT : i ; -LRB- REG : ASIA ; -RRB- -LRB- REG : ENGL ; -RRB- -LRB- REG : EURO ; -RRB- -LRB- REG : BRIT ; -RRB- -LRB- REG : SCAN ; -RRB- -LRB- REG : MEST ; -RRB- -LRB- REG : AFRI ; -RRB- -LRB- REG : INDI ; -RRB- -LRB- LANG : ENGLISH ; -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- AP-NY-02-19-98 0802EST .
