0 417 9806.218 NEWS STORY SOURCE : The Washington Post SECTION : C14 LENGTH : 729 DATE : June 17 , 1998 HEADLINE : Disney in Talks to Buy WJLA ; ABC Would Take Over Allbritton 's Television Empire BODY_LEN : 698 Walt Disney Co. is negotiating to buy WJLA -LRB- Channel 7 -RRB- in Washington and seven other TV stations across the country owned by broadcasting and banking magnate Joe L. Allbritton , sources said yesterday .
418 691 If the negotiations are successful , Disney-owned ABC would take over management of WJLA , the local ABC affiliate , and establish it as the Washington base for the network , which already owns stations in 10 other major cities including New York , Chicago and Los Angeles .
692 824 Allbritton Communications ' stations could fetch $ 750 million to $ 900 million , according to rough valuations by industry sources .
825 914 `` Yeah , we 're interested , '' said an ABC executive who did not want to be identified .
915 986 The executive said ABC does not publicly discuss possible acquisitions .
987 1126 Disney , like other broadcasting networks , is eager to buy local stations , which are the most profitable part of the television business .
1127 1290 The ABC network is ailing and anticipates losses this year , though such losses are more than offset by strong profits of the local stations ABC owns and operates .
1291 1420 Allbritton 's TV empire is attractive because it is one of the few remaining groups of ABC affiliates that Disney could purchase .
1421 1549 Federal deregulation of the broadcasting business in 1996 raised limits on the number of stations that a single company can own .
1550 1646 It set off a buying frenzy , which has driven the price of television stations to record levels .
1647 1806 Allbritton , 72 , owns Allbritton Communications Corp. and has a controlling interest in Riggs National Corp. of Washington , the parent company of Riggs Bank .
1807 1894 He has been approached repeatedly about selling the bank , but has rejected the offers .
1895 1973 Price could be the crucial factor in negotiations for the television stations .
1974 2030 Both Disney and Allbritton are known as hard bargainers .
2031 2287 Allbritton and his son , Robert , 28 , chief operating officer of Allbritton Communications , were in London yesterday for the annual shareholders meeting of Riggs AP Bank , a British affiliate of Riggs National Bank , and could not be reached for comment .
2288 2411 Jerald Fritz , general counsel of Allbritton Communications , said the company does not comment on rumors or media reports .
2412 2516 Through a separate company , Allbritton also owns Newschannel 8 , the Washington all-news cable channel .
2517 2672 Industry sources said Newschannel 8 , a six-year-old local station that has yet to turn a profit , is included in the package Disney is negotiating to buy .
2673 2843 Allbritton Communications owns six other ABC affiliates , in Lynchburg , Va. ; Tulsa , Okla. ; Harrisburg , Pa. ; Charleston , S.C. ; Tuscaloosa , Ala. ; and Little Rock .
2844 2956 It owns a low-power station in Alabama and manages another station that serves the Tuscaloosa-Birmingham market .
2957 3126 WJLA -- which stands for Joe L. Allbritton -- is the big prize in Allbritton 's empire , accounting for half the $ 173 million in revenue the company reported last year .
3127 3276 The stations generated almost $ 62.8 million in operating cash flow last year , and reported a loss of $ 3 million for the six months ended March 31 .
3277 3416 Industry analysts say cash flow is a better measure of a TV station 's performance than profits and is the factor used to determine prices .
3417 3603 Stations recently have been selling for 12 to 15 times annual cash flow , which would place the value of Allbritton Communications ' stations in the $ 750 million to $ 900 million range .
3604 3823 Washington has been a relatively poor market for ABC , primarily because WJLA 's lagging local newscast has had poor ratings , which have translated into smaller audiences and advertising rates for the network 's shows .
3824 3943 ABC counts on local news as a `` lead-in '' for its `` World News Tonight With Peter Jennings '' and other programming .
3944 4144 WJLA 's 5 p.m. newscast , anchored by Paul Berry and Kathleen Mathews , finished third in the ratings during the May `` sweeps , '' despite being preceded by Oprah Winfrey 's hugely popular talk show .
4145 4350 Its 6 p.m. news also ranked third , behind WRC -LRB- Channel 4 -RRB- and WUSA -LRB- Channel 9 -RRB- , and was tied for second at 11 p.m. with WUSA , although both were a distant second to WRC at that hour .
4351 4475 If it purchases the station , ABC would likely beef up WJLA 's local news operation to bolster ratings for the network news .
4476 4647 ABC owns stations in 10 cities , covering about 25 percent of the nation 's population , leaving it well below the federal ownership limit of 35 percent of the population .
4647 4647 .
