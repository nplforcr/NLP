417 529 Q. It 's a contradiction in terms , but what modern traditions are people introducing to their seders this year ?
530 548 A. I have no idea .
549 656 I 've gone to the same family seder for 47 years and I still have n't gotten seated at the adult table yet .
657 709 My little cousins have to fight me for the Afikomen .
710 736 Q. Interesting new dishes ?
737 744 A. No. .
745 873 It 's entirely possible that in the early fifties , a very large brisket was delivered to our family and we 're still eating it .
874 937 We not only have the same food , we have the same conversation .
938 994 I do n't go anywhere else for holidays but to my family .
995 1134 I went to London for one holiday when I was in my 20s , and now it 's mentioned at Passover as a plague _ ` The Year Fran Went to London . '

1420 1447 They 're the cheerier Jews .
1448 1496 All Jewish melodies should be in a mournful key .
1497 1574 I mean , if you 're going to be cheerful , you might as well be Episcopalian .
1575 1618 Q. Do you ever have non-Jews at your seder ?
1619 1693 A. Sometimes , but I do n't like it because then the seder takes too long .
1694 1730 Everyone feels they have to explain .

1790 1856 A. How freeing can it be to have to get to Poughkeepsie by 6 p.m. ?
