0 496 9801.219 NEWS STORY SOURCE : The Washington Post SECTION : A11 LENGTH : 1099 DATE : January 20 , 1998 HEADLINE : Cohen Hails Achievements In China Visit ; Halt in Missile Sales to Iran , Closer Military Ties Cited BODY_LEN : 1045 BEIJING , Jan. 20 -LRB- Tuesday -RRB- - Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen said today that he is satisfied Beijing will not continue sales of anti-ship missiles to Iran as he wrapped up a four-day visit here that underscored improving Sino-American military ties .
497 628 At a news conference before departing for Tokyo , Cohen described his meetings with Chinese officials as `` warm and productive . ''
629 892 Most notably , U.S. officials said , the Chinese military granted Cohen an unprecedented peek at a heretofore secret air defense command center and concluded its first formal agreement with the Pentagon -- a protocol designed to avert clashes or accidents at sea .
893 1041 Cohen declined , however , to say explicitly whether Chinese Defense Minister Chi Haotian had agreed to cancel any existing missile deals with Iran .
1042 1280 China reportedly has sold C-801 and C-802 anti-ship cruise missiles to Iran in defiance of U.S. concerns that they could threaten Persian Gulf shipping , and it remains unclear if China has contracted to sell Iran any additional missiles .
1281 1485 Nevertheless , Cohen 's sojourn here highlighted significant advances in one of Washington 's most sensitive military relationships -- between the world 's most powerful country and its most populous one .
1486 1677 Less than two years ago , a U.S. aircraft carrier battle group was facing off against Chinese forces on military exercises near the Strait of Taiwan , and tensions were high in both capitals .
1678 1960 Since then , U.S. and Chinese officials have labored to improve ties despite domestic opposition , lingering mistrust and strong disagreement over Taiwan -- an island state of 21 million people that China considers a rogue province and the United States is legally bound to support .
1961 2189 Cohen 's visit here -- the fifth leg of a seven-nation tour of East Asia -- has built on a groundswell of good feelings engendered by the October meeting in Washington between President Clinton and Chinese President Jiang Zemin .
2190 2435 At his news conference , Cohen held out the prospect that the U.S. embargo on military sales to China might someday be lifted -- an embargo imposed in 1989 , following China 's bloody crackdown on student-led democracy demonstrations in Beijing .
2436 2557 He said the Chinese had asked to buy spare parts for unarmed U.S.-built Blackhawk helicopters purchased in the mid-1980s .
2558 2746 On Monday , Cohen tried to calm Chinese concerns that strengthened U.S. defense ties with Japan , Australia and , recently , the Philippines and Singapore may be designed to contain China .
2747 2860 `` Today , China is an Asian power and rightfully so , '' he told an audience at the Academy of Military Science .
2861 2943 `` The United States does not fear this , nor do we view China as an adversary . ''
2944 3060 Defense Minister Chi responded that the United States also should not fear China 's push to become a regional power .
3061 3275 `` It is groundless to describe the modernization drive of China 's army , which is for the sake of the country 's economic construction and of a defensive nature , as an unstable factor in the region , '' he said .
3276 3506 U.S. officials noted also that China has begun sharing some information on events in North Korea , where a food shortage and an unpredictable Communist regime have combined to raise fears for the stability of the Korean peninsula .
3507 3697 Military contacts between the two nations , nearly nonexistent in 1996 , have ballooned to almost weekly visits by Chinese officers to the United States and vice versa , U.S. officials said .
3698 3848 On Monday , Chinese army chief of staff Fu Quanyou invited Gen. Henry Shelton , chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff , to China later this year .
3849 3933 Still , the United States appears more eager than China to broaden the relationship .
3934 4088 In recent months , U.S. military officials have suggested a number of initiatives on which the Chinese have either failed to respond or have watered down .
4089 4297 Among other things , U.S. officials have asked that American and Chinese pilots be allowed to exchange visits ; the Americans are particularly interested in flying China 's new Russian-made SU-27 fighter jet .
4298 4359 The Chinese have balked at the request , U.S. officials said .
4360 4511 Cohen also called today for the two sides to visit each other 's nuclear-weapons sites , and he noted that the Chinese were `` studying '' the request .
4512 4605 Cohen 's visit to Beijing 's Air Defense Command Center Monday was the highlight of his trip .
4606 4744 Arranged just days before he arrived , the visit gave him and U.S. military experts a glance into the heart of China 's defense structure .
4745 4811 Cohen was accompanied by 14 other U.S. officials , including Adam .
4812 4865 Joseph W. Prueher , commander of U.S. Pacific forces .
4866 5050 The eight-story building , fashioned Soviet-style from concrete , is situated in southeastern Beijing behind a lightly guarded gate , according to a U.S. official traveling with Cohen .
5051 5182 Commanded by a lieutenant general , the center is responsible for defending the skies in a 200-mile radius around China 's capital .
5183 5430 It has the ability to coordinate surface-to-air missile batteries ; to track thousands of military and commercial planes in the region daily ; and , most significantly , to generate an integrated response to a potential crisis , the official said .
5431 5556 `` It was an interesting mixture of old and new ... of technology from the late 1950s and early 1980s , '' the official said .
5557 5606 `` Some places had computers with large displays .
5607 5702 In other places , I smelled vacuum tubes '' -- electronic components that preceded transistors .
5703 5814 One of the murkiest areas of China 's military scope is its sales of components of weapons of mass destruction .
5815 5970 Last week , Clinton certified that China has stopped selling nuclear-weapons-related material -- a problem that bedeviled U.S.-Chinese relations for years .
5971 6061 U.S. officials say they are still concerned that China is exporting conventional missiles .
6062 6247 On Monday , Cohen departed from the advance text of his speech at the military academy to express pleasure that Chi had reiterated assurances that missile sales to Iran had been halted .
6248 6407 That pledge was made just before the Washington summit meeting , but Cohen said on his arrival in Beijing Saturday that he intended to follow up on the matter .
6408 6656 U.S. officials said there was some confusion about whether China would fulfill existing missile contracts to Iran or cancel them as well , but Cohen declared : `` I believe that we have assurances that such sales will not continue in the future . ''
6657 6921 At the same time , he warned that any disruption of the flow of oil from the Persian Gulf as a result of technology provided by the Chinese would have `` a damaging effect on China 's relations with many countries around the world , including the United States . ''
