0 537 9804.266 NEWS STORY SOURCE : The Washington Post SECTION : A02 LENGTH : 805 DATE : April 13 , 1998 HEADLINE : Clinton Aides , McCain Vow Strong Tobacco Bill ; Industry Lawyer Says Walkout From Legislative Process Was ` Absolutely Not ' a Bluff BODY_LEN : 793 John Schwartz , Washington Post Staff Writer The Clinton administration and members of Congress yesterday vowed to pass strong anti-tobacco legislation even though the tobacco industry walked out of the legislative process last week and threatened to fight such a bill in court .
538 741 Tobacco companies said last Wednesday that the June 1997 settlement proposal reached with state attorneys general was `` dead '' and they were abandoning attempts to craft legislation based on that deal .
742 920 Despite the walkout , `` We will get bipartisan legislation this year , '' Health and Human Services Secretary Donna E. Shalala declared on NBC 's `` Meet the Press '' yesterday .
921 991 `` There 's no question about it because it 's about public health . ''
992 1028 Sen. John McCain -LRB- R-Ariz . -RRB-
1029 1186 , who sponsored the leading tobacco bill in Congress , said on CBS 's `` Face the Nation , '' `` I 'm optimistic that we can get this done by this summer . ''
1187 1407 Noting that the White House and public health advocates have complained that his bill is n't tough enough while the industry has said it can not live with his bill , McCain said , `` I think we may be well-positioned . ''
1408 1578 Office of Management and Budget Director Franklin D. Raines , on ABC 's `` This Week , '' said it was regrettable that the industry withdrew from the legislative process .
1579 1664 `` We think they should come back , but no one is going to beg them , '' Raines said .
1665 1919 Representatives of the industry yesterday stepped up their attacks on the McCain bill , which they say is far more financially punishing to the industry and affords it less protection from lawsuits than the settlement tobacco companies reached last year .
1920 1981 The McCain bill would raise tobacco taxes by $ 1.10 per pack .
1982 2322 But J. Philip Carlton , the lead industry attorney negotiating tobacco legislation with the White House and Congress , said that in practice , the McCain bill would increase per-pack cigarette costs to $ 5 , which would lead to greatly increased black market sales of cigarettes and youths ' `` buying their cigarettes from drug dealers . ''
2323 2497 Carlton , who said some 2 million tobacco-related jobs would be endangered by the bill , declared that the industry would challenge the McCain bill in court if it is enacted .
2498 2665 The McCain bill would bankrupt tobacco companies , Philip Morris senior vice president Steven C. Parrish warned on both `` Meet the Press '' and `` Face the Nation . ''
2666 2776 `` We can not sit down and agree to do things that will end up putting us out of business , '' he said on NBC .
2777 2942 Some industry analysts , such as Martin Feldman of Smith Barney , have said the McCain bill would bankrupt tobacco companies , especially debt-ridden R. J. Reynolds .
2943 3043 But Jeffrey Harris , an MIT professor who studies the economics of the tobacco industry , disagreed .
3044 3162 `` So far I have n't been able to find a substantiation of why it would go bankrupt , '' Harris said in an inter view .
3163 3272 `` Any penalty imposed on the industry is going to be passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices . ''
3273 3367 Harris said the price increases would cause consumption and industry profitability to decline .
3368 3549 But he said the losses at each of the multinational tobacco conglomerates could be offset to some degree by their non-tobacco businesses and international sales of tobacco products .
3550 3909 `` What I have n't been able to figure out yet is how any analyst is somehow getting from moderate or even marked declines in domestic market profitability translating into bankruptcy , '' Harris said , suggesting that even Reynolds could deal with its debt load by the usual corporate belt-tightening tools , including lower dividend payouts to shareholders .
3910 4027 Representatives of the industry also were asked whether last week 's walkout was a bluff or part of a long-term plan .
4028 4183 A December 1997 memorandum prepared for the industry by a consultant -- the Bozell Sawyer Miller Group -- outlined an `` exit '' strategy for the industry .
4184 4432 The memo called for an aggressive public education campaign in support of the 1997 deal , in which the industry agreed to pay $ 368 billion over 25 years and accept restrictions to curb youth smoking in return for protection against major lawsuits .
4433 4632 But the memo suggested that if things did not go well for tobacco companies , the industry could argue that it `` made a legitimate offer and the politicians played politics and made a mess of it . ''
4633 4810 The McCain bill would increase costs to the industry by about 40 percent -- to $ 516 billion over the next 25 years -- and would not give the companies as much legal protection .
4811 4935 Asked whether the industry was `` just walking out in order to get a better deal , '' Carlton responded , `` Absolutely not !
4936 5015 `` The process in Washington has gotten completely out of control , '' he said .
5016 5210 `` It 's gone from what once was a noble purpose of reducing youth smoking and use of other tobacco products to a process now that has only to do with big taxes , big government and big brother .
5211 5238 And we 're not bluffing . ''
5239 5239 .
