0 439 9806.183 NEWS STORY SOURCE : The Washington Post SECTION : A33 LENGTH : 896 DATE : June 19 , 1998 HEADLINE : Turks Send Warplanes To Cyprus ; Ankara Aims to Deter Military Buildup BODY_LEN : 825 ANKARA , Turkey , June 18 - Turkey sent six F-16 fighter jets to northern Cyprus today in response to Greece 's brief deployment of fighter jets to southern Cyprus , and warned Athens against attempting a military buildup on the divided island .
440 628 As the F-16 deployment was announced , Foreign Minister Ismail Cem said the Turkish government will take `` all necessary measures '' against any Greek plans for aggression against Turkey .
629 894 While Greece and the Greek-Cypriot government condemned the move , Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz , who was in Romania on an official visit , said the possibility of war between Turkey and Greece over Cyprus `` largely depends on the Greek-Cypriot attitude . ''
895 1182 The Turkish fighters flew into the Gecitkale Air Base in northern Cyprus two days after four Greek F-16s and a C-130 transport plane landed at the Greek-Cypriot Paphos Air Base for a brief stopover , the first known landings of Greek aircraft at the base since its completion in January .
1183 1271 Three of the six Turkish jets reportedly returned to their base near Ankara later today .
1272 1400 Greek-Cypriot Defense Minister Yiannakis Omirou told reporters the Greek aircraft stopover sent a `` specific political message .
1401 1545 That the -LRB- Greek-Greek Cypriot -RRB- common defense doctrine will exist and continue to develop so long as there is Turkish expansionism . ''
1546 1644 Turkey condemned the Greek move , calling it an `` extremely grave and provocative development . ''
1645 1756 Cem accused Athens of developing a strategy to use Cyprus as a springboard in the event of an attack on Turkey .
1757 1977 Under a 1993 defense pact between the internationally recognized Greek-Cypriot government and Greece , Athens pledged military support to the Greek Cypriots in the event hostilities break out on the Mediterranean island .
1978 2248 Turkey , which has 30,000 troops in northern Cyprus , has its own defense pact with the self-proclaimed Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus -- a nation recognized only by Ankara -- under which Turkey pledges responsibility for the security of the Turkish-Cypriot sector .
2249 2484 Britain , which maintains military bases on Cyprus , called for restraint in the wake of the fighter-jet deployments , and a Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman in turn said Ankara would ask Britain to help reduce tension on the island .
2485 2631 Britain is Cyprus 's former colonial ruler and is named as a guarantor power , along with Turkey and Greece , under the 1960 Cypriot constitution .
2632 2850 Greek-Turkish friction over Cyprus has heightened over the past 1Ê1\/2 years , triggering concern in Washington that the heavily militarized island could become a flash point for armed conflict between the NATO allies .
2851 3007 Cyprus has been divided since 1974 , when Turkey invaded the northern third of the island to support the Turkish-Cypriot minority after a Greek-backed coup .
3008 3214 This week 's confrontation over the use of the Greek air base comes amid rising tension over the expected delivery of a Russian S-300 ground-to-air missile defense system to southern Cyprus later this year .
3215 3298 Ankara has threatened to use force to prevent the deployment of the missile system .
3299 3585 Efforts by the United States and Europe to defuse tension and broker a settlement on Cyprus were set back after the European Union decided last December to begin membership negotiations with the Greek-Cypriot government and at the same time left Turkey off its short list of candidates .
3586 3769 In the wake of those decisions , Ankara froze political dialogue with the EU and Ankara , and the Turkish-Cypriot leadership hardened their position regarding Cyprus settlement talks .
3770 4042 Turkish-Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash insists that the talks be carried out on a state-to-state basis -- which would force official recognition of the Turkish-Cypriot entity by the south -- and that President Glafcos Clerides withdraw the Cypriot EU membership application .
4043 4228 Ankara welcomed `` relative progress '' in Turkish-EU ties made at this week 's European summit at Cardiff , Wales , but stopped short of calling for a resumption of political dialogue .
4229 4420 Britain , which holds the EU presidency , hailed the Cardiff meeting as a positive step toward rapprochement with Ankara , saying that Turkey 's membership candidacy was clearly acknowledged .
4421 4600 But a Turkish Foreign Ministry statement criticized the Cardiff meeting for reiterating what Ankara considers to be unacceptable EU conditions for Turkey 's membership to advance .
4601 4797 Those conditions are that Turkey improves its human rights record and makes progress on solving its disputes with Greece , including Aegean territorial disputes as well as the tension over Cyprus .
4798 4949 Ankara is also seeking the release of EU financial aid for Ankara called for under a 1996 customs union agreement but which has been held up by Greece .
4950 5112 Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitas said he rebuffed a telephone appeal from President Clinton during the Cardiff summit to soften the Greek stance toward Turkey .
5113 5181 `` I told President Clinton that this was not possible , '' he said .
5182 5391 The United States , concerned that the EU snub could drive Turkey away from the West and increase the risk of conflict in the Aegean , has stepped up diplomatic efforts aimed at improving Turkish-EU relations .
5392 5618 Richard Holbrooke , the Clinton administration 's special envoy to Cyprus and newly nominated ambassador to the United Nations , will visit Athens on Monday , State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said in Washington today .
