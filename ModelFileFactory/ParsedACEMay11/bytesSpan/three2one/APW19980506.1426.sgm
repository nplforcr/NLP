510 592 HOTEL recruits , early in their careers , are taught to always have a smile ready .
593 733 These days , however , their employers - hotel and resort operators - are finding it increasingly difficult to stretch those facial muscles .
734 940 After many years of strong growth , local hoteliers are now treading the downward trajectory of their cyclical industry , and with rock bottom still far ahead , there 's more reason to be glum than smiling .
941 1038 The root cause of the industry 's troubles , ironically , stemmed from optimism about the future .
1039 1156 With one of the fastest growing economies in the world , Malaysia seemed a sure bet for putting up a hotel or resort .
1157 1241 After all , it had continuously attracted ever more business and holiday travellers .
1242 1337 But even as new hotels were rapidly springing up , warning bells were set off as early as 1995 .
1338 1535 New hotel rooms coming onstream in most parts of Malaysia far outstripped the increase in tourist arrivals , and occupancy levels and room rates in most states had begun to fall by the end of 1996 .
1536 1597 The stage was being set for a showdown in the hotel industry .
1598 1767 This was before the ugly , choking pall of smoke known as the haze blanketed Southeast Asia and scared off several million business and holiday tourists from the region .
1768 1946 Thanks to the haze , tourist arrivals in 1997 were almost 17 % lower than the year before , the first time in decades there had been a drop in the number of arrivals to Malaysia .
1947 2177 Analysts tracking the hotel sector said occupancy levels in 1997 fell 5 - 10 % from 1996 's figures , partly due to the bad publicity Malaysia received during the year , and partly because there were lots more rooms on the market .
2178 2309 Hotels in the country , on average , enjoyed occupancy levels of 62.5 % in 1996 , although city hotels boasted a figure of 70-75 % .
2310 2422 For 1988 , an even more severe fall is predicted as more hotel rooms come into service and competition heats up .
2423 2572 Analysts said 13 five-star hotels with a total of 7,678 rooms and 24 three - and four-star hotels with around 8,680 rooms are being built nationwide .
2573 2676 This would more than double the existing stock of three , four - and five-star hotel rooms in Malaysia .
2677 2894 In Kuala Lumpur alone , some 13,161 hotel rooms were under construction in 1997 , with another 18,165 rooms in the pipeline -LRB- though no doubt some projects have been dropped because of the economic slowdown -RRB- .
2895 2957 For comparison , the city at the time had barely 17,000 rooms .
2958 3125 Selangor , meanwhile , is expected to have more than 10,000 hotel rooms by the time the Commonwealth Games take place , about twice the existing supply of 5,640 rooms .
3126 3252 The Ministry of Finance 's 1997 Property Market report says the situation is pretty much the same in most of the other states .
3253 3304 ` The signs were already there , this overbuilding .
3305 3441 Even in 1995 the signs were there , ' a puzzled Low Gee Tat , managing director of Federal Hotels International , told Investors Digest .
3442 3483 ` We were already feeling the pinch then .
3484 3534 Although occupancy was still OK , the rates stank .
3535 3602 The sheer difficulty in operating just eroded into our bottom line .
3603 3709 It was difficult to get staff , competition was intense - it was a very difficult situation to operate in .
3710 3894 ` Somehow , somewhere , the developers that went into the business in recent years read the wrong signals or got the wrong advice or whatever , because the signs were definitely there .
3895 3954 There 's really a big glut in this country , a huge glut . '
3955 4087 Federal Hotels International -LRB- FHI -RRB- is the hotel arm of the Low Yat group , one of Malaysia 's largest property developers .
4088 4207 They were the first to build and operate an international class hotel in Malaysia - The Federal Kuala Lumpur - in 1957 .
4208 4340 Today , FHI has a chain of four - and five-star hotels , five of which are run jointly with Inter-Continental Hotels dAMP ; Resorts .
4341 4492 Inked on November 1996 , the ` strategic alliance ' gave birth to Federal Inter-Continental Hotels and Resorts Malaysia , of which Low is the chairman .
4493 4770 The hotels in FHI 's line-up , besides The Federal , are The Capitol Kuala Lumpur , Crown Princess Inter-Continental Kuala Lumpur , Forum Fairlane Hotel Kuala Lumpur , the Ferringhi Beach Hotel Penang , and the Marina Mirage Inter - Continental Penang -LRB- opening soon -RRB- .
4771 4891 Overseas , FHI owns the Forum The Grace Hotel Sydney and Rushcutters Bay Sydney -LRB- opening 1999 -RRB- , in Australia .
4892 5028 Low explained that with occupancy levels falling because rooms outnumbered tourists , hoteliers came under pressure to lower room rates .
5029 5149 But four - and five-star hotels in Malaysia were always among the cheapest in the world , if not the cheapest , he said .
5150 5236 ` For the service and quality you get , room rates have never been on the high side . '
5237 5284 Operating costs on the other hand were soaring .
5285 5350 Trouble was indeed brewing -LRB- see story on hotel stocks -RRB- .
5351 5490 Then came the haze in the later half of 1977 , which forced hoteliers to drastically lower their already low rates just to fill some rooms .
5491 5605 As a result profit margins and yields were eroded further , and the books of many hotel operators blushed scarlet .
5606 5685 ` It was an undeclared price war , ' Low admitted , ` but that is an ugly word .
5686 5763 After that knock by the haze , a lot of hotels had to do it out of necessity .
5764 5784 They had to survive .
5785 5907 They did n't do it to increase market share or as strategy - it was like scraping the barrel just to get some occupancy . '
5908 5948 Things have n't improved much this year .
5949 6079 The first quarter has traditionally been slow for city-based hotels , but this year ` it 's been slower than normal , ' noted Low .
6080 6316 ` The ideal situation for January to March in a decent year is an occupancy rate of 70-75 % with good -LRB- room -RRB- rates , but so far this year the average occupancy has been between 50 and 55 % and room rates have also come down . '
6317 6440 FHI had foreseen a few years ago that the future would be tougher , and had implemented counteracting strategies , he said .
6441 6500 Nevertheless , FHI 's bottomline has not escaped unscathed .
6501 6590 ` There 's no way we can operate a hotel the way we did even five years ago , ' said Low .
6591 6663 ` We had to become more efficient , more productive and more innovative .
6664 6709 We 've done that and we are still doing that .
6710 6792 We 've had to change the cost structure and we are changing the manning structure .
6793 6915 ` From these basic infrastructural changes , we got into a position to really look at our products and to know our market .
6916 6976 If we had to , we changed our products to suit the market . '
6977 7247 Once the products -LRB- hotel rooms and special packages -RRB- had been fine - tuned , FHI focused on the domestic market and went all out to retain the customers it had by making it ` even more value-for-money for them , to give them even more reason to stay with us . '
7248 7368 At the same time , FHI aggressively tried to tap new overseas markets , especially in East Europe and the United States .
7369 7535 Low said the group already had a representative office in Europe which not only pushed FHI 's hotels but also promoted Malaysia as a holiday and business destination .
7536 7621 ` There must be a reason for them to come here in the first place , ' he pointed out .
7622 7779 Some analysts predict it would take at least until the end of 1999 before visitor arrivals grow large enough to start pushing up occupancy levels nationwide .
7780 7860 The estimate , however , assumes that the haze does n't become an annual blight .
7861 7908 But behind every dark cloud is a silver lining .
7909 7993 It seems ironic that the economic downturn may provide some respite to the industry .
7994 8146 Some hotel projects are unlikely to be implemented now and the weak Ringgit will also discourage traveling abroad , and thus encourage domestic tourism .
8147 8223 Besides , the devaluation makes it cheaper for foreigners to visit Malaysia .
8224 8349 Furthermore , Low said the current problems are pushing hotel owners and operators into working together for the good of all .
8350 8401 ` We 've met and discussed some issues , ' he said .
8402 8499 ` There are many areas we can work together but at the moment I 'm not at liberty to reveal them .
8500 8652 One obvious area , however , where we can cooperate is by marketing the country together , to give foreigners a reason to come and stay in our hotels . '
8653 8808 On their part , the authorities could promote in addition to the Commonwealth Games , other world-class sporting and cultural events in Malaysia , he said .
8809 8881 This would generate global publicity and tempt some foreigners to visit .
8882 8928 But all these are ideas yet to be implemented .
8929 8970 Who knows what will happen in the future ?
8971 9003 For now , one thing is for sure .
9004 9192 While it may be difficult for hotel owners and operators to smile in these tough times , frontline employees will be under strict orders to flash those pearly whites at the few they serve .
