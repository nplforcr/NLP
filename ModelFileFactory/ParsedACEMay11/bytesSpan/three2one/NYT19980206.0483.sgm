Times News Service dLR ; dQC ; dQL ; NEW YORK _ A city police officer has been dismissed for ordering child pornography through the mail , police department officials said Friday .
465 673 Police Commissioner Howard Safir this week ordered the dismissal of the officer , Brian Matthews , 35 , who has been on modified assignment since August 1995 , after he was linked to a child pornography ring .
674 1083 According to testimony during a police department administrative trial last fall , Canadian investigators were conducting a sting operation using the mailing list of a child pornographer when they received an order from Matthews ' address in New Hyde Park , N.Y. Postal inspectors said the order contained $ 48 in cash and a form requesting three videotapes depicting sexual acts involving boys as young as 7 .
1084 1262 The name on the order form was that of a former resident at Matthews ' home , but a handwriting analyst testified at the departmental trial that Matthews had written the request .
1263 1380 A fingerprint expert testified that two prints on the order form appeared to match Matthews ' index finger and thumb .
1381 1601 Although police investigators had previously stated that Matthews was arrested after signing for the tapes under the bogus name , postal inspectors said that he was never arrested and that the tapes were never delivered .
1602 1640 Matthews was a 15-year police veteran .
1641 1796 His lawyer , Marvyn Kornberg , said Matthews denied any involvement with the order , and he pointed out that federal authorities had declined to prosecute .
