261 463 In nineteen ninety-one Charles Keating was convicted in state court of helping to defraud thousands of investors who bought high risk junk bonds sold by Keating 's employees at Lincoln savings and loan .
464 552 The bonds became worthless when the bankrupt thrift was seized by government regulators .
553 633 Keating 's convictions were thrown out in nineteen ninety-six on a technicality .
634 719 And on that basis Keating was released from prison before he was eligible for parole .
720 867 Now the ninth US circuit court of appeals has ruled that the original appeal was flawed since it brought up issues that had not been raised before .
868 1011 That means the convictions stand , a ruling likely to send Keating 's lawyers back to state court where they must start over with a new appeal .
