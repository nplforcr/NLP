0 55 ea980109 .1830.0290 NEWS STORY Okay , thanks very much .
56 117 Bob Sheets , nice to see you again under these circumstances .
118 222 Now , we 're going to go west because over New Mexico today , another attempt at glory ended in failure .
223 289 Getting around the world in a balloon must be extremely difficult .
290 342 No one has been able to do it , and many have tried .
343 448 The latest attempt by Dick Rutan and Dave Melton began only this morning , and it did n't last very long .
449 477 Here 's ABC 's Lisa Salters .
478 601 Not the way veteran pilot Dick Rutan thought his highly anticipated million dollar balloon ride around the world would end .
602 705 Forced to abandon ship twelve thousand feet in the air only a few hours into his quest to make history .
706 835 You know , just a while ago , we 're on our way around the world , and now I 'm e - standing in a field with a cactus in my face .
836 931 Rutan and co-pilot Dave Melton boarded their balloon , the Global Hilton , shortly before dawn .
932 957 The launch went smoothly .
958 1009 The craft slowly rose and disappeared out of sight .
1010 1123 Onboard , the two balloonists thought what was supposed to be an adventurous two week journey was just beginning .
1124 1175 But less than an hour later , something went wrong .
1176 1301 As the sun came up , we started to get some heating in the in the capsule , and it started to ascend very nice , very slowly .
1302 1404 And then we just heard a boom and looked up , and the whole bottom of the bal - balloon had blown out .
1405 1547 The unique craft that was supposed to allow Rutan to make it around the world was designed as a balloon within a balloon with a helium center .
1548 1681 But that center ruptured without warning and started to leak at twenty-seven thousand feet , forty miles from where the flight began .
1682 1858 Because winds were gusting , the pilots were n't able to land the balloon , and with four thousand pounds of potentially explosive fuel onboard , they had only one option left .
1859 1935 Dave and I just looked at each other , and we both knew what the answer was .
1936 2041 It 's a lot better to d - land in a parachute in twenty-five knot wind than to try to land in that thing .
2042 2079 Rutan suffered only cuts and bruises .
2080 2150 Melton dislocated his hip and had to be medivaced to a local hospital .
2151 2204 What will happen to the balloon is a different story .
2205 2366 The unmanned craft started to descend but rose again to thirty thousand feet and is heading east at close to ninety miles an hour , still fully loaded with fuel .
2367 2462 Once the sun sets and temperatures drop , Rutan hopes the balloon will fall to earth by itself .
