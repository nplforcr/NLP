WHITNEY dQC ; dLR ; dQL ; dUR ; c. 1998 N.Y. Times News Service dQC ; dLR ; dQL ; PARIS _ Nine months after the car crash that killed Diana , Princess of Wales , and her companion , Dodi Fayed , a French investigator on Friday grilled photographers who pursued the couple , relatives of the dead and witnesses to try to determine how it happened .
649 943 The investigator , Judge Herve Stephan , is trying to determine whether nine photographers and a motorcyclist arrested at the scene of the accident last Aug. 31 may have somehow caused the chauffeur of the couple 's Mercedes to lose control and crash into a tunnel support pillar at high speed .
944 1083 The driver , Henri Paul , acting security chief of the Ritz Hotel , owned by Dodi Fayed 's father , Mohamed Fayed , also died in the crash .
1084 1219 The French authorities later determined that he was legally drunk at the time of the accident and had been taking antidepressant drugs .
1220 1501 Stephan convened Mohamed Fayed , Diana 's mother , Frances Shand Kydd , the photographers and a battery of lawyers Friday morning in the bidding room of the medieval Palace of Justice , a chamber normally used to auction seized goods , for a virtual reconstruction of the accident .
1502 1610 The sole survivor of the crash , Trevor Rees-Jones , a bodyguard who worked for the Fayeds , did not attend .
1611 1795 `` The immorality , the inhumanity of what they did , '' Fayed said of the photographers during a break in the proceedings outside the palace , on the Ile de la Cite , near Notre Dame .
1796 1851 `` If I was not in a courtroom , I would hang them all .
1852 1897 They were like vultures around the bodies . ''
1898 1941 Mrs. Shand Kydd did not speak to reporters .
1942 1983 `` She wo n't talk to me , '' Fayed said .
1984 2025 `` She thinks she 's in the royal family .
2026 2074 I 'm just an ordinary guy , a working-class guy .
2075 2093 It 's snobbery . ''
2094 2249 Fayed , an Egyptian citizen who also owns the Harrods department store in London , has been fighting for acceptance by the British establishment for years .
2250 2504 He has also encouraged speculation that the accident was somehow arranged by the British secret service to ensure that Diana , as the mother of a potential heir to the British throne and head of the Church of England , would not marry his son , a Muslim .
2505 2605 Diana and Prince Charles , the eldest son of Queen Elizabeth II , were divorced before the accident .
2606 2946 With conspiracy theories and denials swirling around England since the accident , Stephan has been doggedly trying to determine who may indeed be guilty of a criminal act in the case : Paul , the photographers , the hotel management or perhaps the elusive driver of a white Fiat Uno supposedly brushed by the Mercedes just before the crash .
2947 3026 Despite a nationwide investigation , neither car nor driver has ever turned up .
3027 3297 French law normally requires a reconstruction of a crime scene , but Stephan has reportedly waived one so far because blocking traffic for hours at the accident site in a busy underpass beneath the Place de l'Alma , on the right bank of the Seine , would be impractical .
3298 3323 -LRB- STORY CAN END HERE .
3324 3542 OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS -RRB- Friday 's session was closed to the public and to reporters , but what little trickled out indicated that the inquiry was stuck at about the point where it has been since late last year .
3543 3692 Various witnesses have said that Paul , the driver , was legally drunk but that the Ritz management and the passengers in the car did not realize it .
3693 3944 The photographers have said they were too far behind the speeding car to have caused it to run out of control and have denied charges that they neglected to try to summon help for the victims because they were busy snapping gory pictures of the scene .
