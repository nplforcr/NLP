549 702 TECHNOETHICS , or the written and unwritten codes of practice in dealing with technology , is becoming imperative as we move towards the Information age .
703 876 This is because the rapid development of technology is not only affecting changes in human thought and behavior , but also stirring up new ethical issues and moral dilemmas .
877 922 The human culture is growing more mechanised .
923 1075 We wake up , eat , work and sleep according to the dictates of the machines that are supposed to make our lives easier than those of our grandparents ' .
1076 1205 Computer chips have been incorporated into everyday objects ever since the introduction of integrated circuits in the late 1950s .
1206 1355 It has been said that today , an average home might have 40 chips in different appliances , from washing machines to television sets to alarm clocks .
1356 1451 And imagine having to go through a day at the office without the help of the good old computer !
1452 1625 In view of the growing dominance of technology , the 20th century man has been considered as a `` sorcerer 's apprentice '' who is becoming a slave of his erstwhile servant .
1626 1755 This is the opinion of a lobby of intellectuals who feel uncomfortable about the growing impact of modern technology on our life .
1756 1872 They suggest that technological progress is getting out of hand , and developing according to its own immanent laws .
1873 1998 It seems that machines , for example , are reshaping man to their own images of stiffness , exactness and `` soullessness '' .
1999 2137 According to them , technology has become `` natural '' to man so much so that he can be referred to as techno , rather than homo sapiens .
2138 2390 However , the other school of thought argues that the perspective which personifies technology as an autonomous agent with mythological properties , is a creation of humanists who have very little insight into the structures of the technological order .
2391 2532 Technology in the broad sense of the word is one of the most fundamental characteristics which define man within the family of living beings .
2533 2687 Unlike animals which are defined by the harmonious way their organs and functions are related to the environment , man largely lacks such a grandiose tie .
2688 2746 His survival can not depend on instinctive reactions only .
2747 2814 He has to learn to react and deal with new situations all the time .
2815 2949 And he can successfully do this by creating an artificial environment for himself , thus allowing the technological milieu to survive .
2950 3080 In fact , with technology , man is in a position to provide a decent living condition for many , if not all , life forms on earth .
3081 3245 It can not be denied that technology also provides the platform for man to destroy his living environment in an irreversible way , and maybe all life on our planet .
3246 3344 The recent intransigence of a south Asian nation in flexing its nuclear muscle is a case in point .
3345 3420 Nevertheless , as has been repeatedly stressed , technology is a mere tool .
3421 3484 It is neutral and has no internal criterion of self-regulation .
3485 3649 Technology also does not exist in a vacuum but within the context of a given culture with beliefs and accepted values , presumably based on religious prescriptions .
3650 3789 The ability to make decisions pertaining to the use of technology by referring to the religious criteria is what technoethics is all about .
3790 3910 One of the most prominent aspects of info technology is the global communications network , represented by the Internet .
3911 4041 Besides information , person-to-person communication in the form of electronic mailing systems and chat groups are also available .
4042 4198 With its wide-reaching capability , the Internet is not only used to retrieve information , but also to add information to the world communications network .
4199 4322 One can find in it a plethora of input and experiences from thousands of people of various cultures , creeds and religions .
4323 4420 The Internet caters to two groups of users , the information providers and information consumers .
4421 4553 Thus , technoethics of the Internet , commonly referred to as netiquette , has to be looked at from the two perspectives separately .
4554 4637 As information providers , users need to be responsible in disseminating the truth .
4638 4701 This is evidently lacking in the global communications network .
4702 4804 There are huge numbers of websites propagating immoral activities , lies and character assassinations .
4805 4884 As a result , all kinds of scandals and slanders are circulating in cyberspace .
4885 5013 Electronic poison letters are also rampant , despite some of the writers and senders themselves claiming to be deeply religious .
5014 5114 Even the use of abusive language is justified on the basis of defending their religious convictions .
5115 5218 The freedom of expression is sometimes taken to such an extent so as to invade other people 's privacy .
5219 5363 How many times have you found unsolicited electronic mail forwarded to you by those who do not have the guts to reveal his or her real identity ?
5364 5432 To these phantom providers , please have a thought for technoethics .
5433 5602 Frankly , without a proper perspective on the good and bad sides of the global communications network , information consumers are at the mercy of unscrupulous providers .
5603 5649 The lure of on-line pornography is tremendous .
5650 5787 Many spend hours daily surfing the Internet for erotic pictures and stories without realizing that they are wasting their time and money .
5788 5893 The worst part is that sometimes it is not of their own but , rather , their department 's or company 's .
5894 5986 As for children , a new sordid phenomenon is unfolding on the Internet , via the chat rooms .
5987 6097 It has been reported recently that cyber-paedophiles and child-molesters are prowling these discussion groups .
6098 6266 They would `` insert '' themselves into the groups by furnishing a respectable biodata , and slowly enticing the youngsters to indulge in sexually explicit discussions .
6267 6287 So parents , beware !
6288 6418 Do not think that once you leave your children in front of the computer terminal , they are safe from corrupt external influences .
6419 6468 The virtual prowlers can get into their bedrooms .
6469 6517 The jungle is not necessarily out there anymore .
6518 6547 Now it is right in our homes .
6548 6616 There is also no substitute for taking good care of your young ones .
6617 6699 Guidance and supervision are still indispensable parts of proper child-upbringing .
6700 6740 Try to inculcate technoethics into them .
6741 6814 The best form of technoethics is one based on a strong faith in religion .
6815 6952 Decades ago , the German philospher Martin Heidegger wrote a letter to his Japanese friend which was reproduced in the Yomiuri newspaper .
6953 7123 In it he expressed his concern that none of today 's cultural traditions possesses the means to cope effectively with the challenges posed by expanding modern technology .
7124 7232 It does not matter whether you are living in a western , modernized society or eastern , developing society .
7233 7305 There is simply no culture suited to tackle the technological onslaught .
7306 7464 What we can do is to responsibly monitor what is taking place in present-day society , and interpret it in the light of our religious and cultural traditions .
7465 7602 For a Muslim , this implies the willingness to internalise the Quranic messages that man has been created not to indulge in vain desires .
7603 7722 He is a representative of Allah on earth and is ultimately responsible for any form of destruction - physical or moral .
7723 7861 The Institute of Islamic Understanding Malaysia is organising a seminar which , inter alia , will deliberate on the issue of technoethics .
7862 7970 The seminar entitled `` Multimedia and Islam '' will be held on Tuesday and Wednesday at IKIM 's Grand Hall .
7971 8020 Members of the public are invited to participate .
