0 332 9802.438 NEWS STORY SOURCE : The Washington Post SECTION : F07 ; LENGTH : 1430 DATE : February 02 , 1998 HEADLINE : For Lewis and Shareholders , BET 's Buyout Offer Is Too Low BODY_LEN : 1465 National Public Radio President Delano Lewis last week violated the adage that there are some things even your best friends wo n't tell you .
333 561 Lewis told his longtime friend Robert Johnson , founder of Washington 's Black Entertainment Television Network , that Johnson 's offer to buy out the public stockholders of BET Holdings Inc. for $ 48 a share is n't good enough .
562 854 The pronouncement surprised investors who had complained that as a hand-picked member of BET 's board , Lewis was likely to rubber stamp the $ 288 million buyout bid made by Johnson and his partners at Liberty Media Group , a subsidiary of the cable television giant Tele-Communications Inc. .
855 1056 But it was a pleasant surprise for the investors who have complained in a shareholders ' lawsuit that Johnson 's $ 48 offer in November was a low-ball bid for stock that could be worth twice that much .
1057 1162 Because of Lewis 's rejection , the betting is that stockholders will get a better offer , probably soon .
1163 1306 Lewis was put on the spot last fall when Johnson appointed him a committee of one to evaluate the offer on behalf of BET 's board of directors .
1307 1454 Like board members of most companies created by entrepreneurs , BET 's directors are not people prone to playing hardball with the chief executive .
1455 1568 Since Johnson controls two-thirds of the votes of BET 's three classes of stock , he picks most of the directors .
1569 1768 For example , BET 's board includes Johnson 's wife , Sheila ; actor Denzel Washington ; TCI President John Malone ; and Liberty President Robert Bennett , as well as others with ties to the founder .
1769 1926 Lewis , a former president of Chesapeake d Potomac Telephone Cos. , is the closest thing the BET board has to an independent , professional outside director .
1927 2019 He also is on the boards of Colgate-Palmolive Co. , Guest Services Inc. and Halliburton Co. .
2020 2189 Asking for an `` independent evaluation '' or a `` fairness opinion '' is standard procedure when insiders of a company make an offer to buy out the public shareholders .
2190 2263 Cynicism is the standard reaction to those `` independent evaluations . ''
2264 2414 Investment bankers in the past have given their stamp of approval to many buyouts that were later declared by judges to be unfair to the stockholders .
2415 2570 Whether the decision to reject the BET offer reinforced that cynicism or proved that board members really can be independent depends on how you look at it .
2571 2704 One view is that not even Bob Johnson 's best friend could have held his nose and proclaimed that $ 48 is a fair price for BET stock .
2705 2925 Giving Lewis full credit for his professionalism and independence , it did n't take an investment banker to suspect the price was too low , even though it was $ 10 a share more than the stock was selling for at the time .
2926 2957 Investors certainly thought so .
2958 3100 As soon as the offer was made in September , the stock jumped to more than $ 50 from about $ 40 a share , then moved up a few dollars a share .
3101 3203 Rejection of the Johnson buyout offer pushed the shares to an all-time high of $ 55.12 1\/2 on Friday .
3204 3303 Another view is that Lewis was guaranteed to get sued if he went along with the $ 48-a-share offer .
3304 3538 A favorable fairness opinion simply would have added Lewis and the investment bankers at Goldman Sachs d Co. to the list of defendants in the shareholders lawsuit , which was filed by a New York attorney who specializes in such cases .
3539 3659 Goldman Sachs was hired by Lewis to crunch the numbers and calculate whether Johnson and TCI were offering a fair price .
3660 3735 Their conclusion was a terse pronouncement that $ 48 `` is not adequate . ''
3736 3899 Lewis was out of town last week and referred inquiries to Arthur Bill of Washington 's Freedman , Levy , Kroll and Simonds , who is counsel to the Lewis committee .
3900 3957 The decision does n't mean the buyout is off , Bill said .
3958 4051 `` Discussions are ongoing between the special committee and the buyers ' group , '' he said .
4052 4123 He would n't say whether Goldman Sachs had placed a value on the stock .
4124 4329 `` All I can say is that Goldman and Salomon Brothers -LRB- the investment bankers for Johnson and TCI -RRB- are going to be engaging in discussions of whether the principals can reach an understanding . ''
4330 4421 BET 's official position is `` no comment , '' said Media Relations Director Michele Moore .
4422 4501 It 's typical for players in these games to hold their cards close to the vest .
4502 4650 One investor who is betting on Johnson to raise his bid is Mario Gabelli , the New York money manager who is the biggest outside shareholder in BET .
4651 4791 A report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission last Thursday reveals Gabelli has been methodically buying up BET stock recently .
4792 4919 As of Jan. 23 he controlled 1.74 million shares , or 17.3 percent of BET 's Class A stock -- the only kind owned by the public .
4920 5007 `` The ball 's now in Bob Johnson and Bob Bennett 's court , '' Gabelli said last week .
5008 5053 `` It 's up to them to up it or walk away . ''
5054 5232 Gabelli 's SEC reports show companies he controls own BET stock for clients , and they 've continued to buy as the stock price has soared well beyond the $ 48 offer on the table .
5233 5301 Clearly , he thinks any new offer would have to be higher than that .
5302 5329 `` Forty-eight was too low .
5330 5351 Everybody knows that .
5352 5456 I 'd pay $ 55 , '' added Gabelli , who said his calculations value BET at between $ 58 and $ 72 a share .
5457 5560 Gabelli says that besides a better offer from BET insiders , there are a couple of other possibilities .
5561 5665 One would be that Goldman and Salomon Bros. ca n't agree on a price , so Johnson puts the offer on hold .
5666 5771 `` In which case , '' Gabelli said , `` my clients are not unhappy '' because they like owning the stock .
5772 5895 Or `` they come in with a price that is below what I call fair , then I can either accept it or go for appraisal rights . ''
5896 6036 Legally , minority shareholders who object to a buyout can demand an independent appraisal of the stock , which both sides must then accept .
6037 6113 Gabelli says he 's not trying to hold the proverbial gun to Johnson 's head .
6114 6224 Quoting one of the aphorisms that has made him a favorite of financial television shows , `` Bulls make money .
6225 6242 Bears make money .
6243 6267 Pigs get slaughtered . ''
6268 6379 While Gabelli insists the stock is worth more than Johnson offered , he is not a party to the shareholder suit .
6380 6430 `` The shareholder lawsuit is a scam , '' he said .
6431 6470 `` These lawyers are ambulance chasers .
6471 6631 It 's like a Madonna concert , they 're rushing to get on queue first '' so they can collect legal fees by persuading the defendants to settle the case quickly .
6632 6738 Some shareholder lawsuits challenging takeovers have merit , he added , `` but some are filed by pilgrims .
6739 6766 You know what pilgrims are ?
6767 6785 Early settlers . ''
6786 6943 Since Johnson made his offer to buy out public shareholders , Gabelli has bought an additional 200,000 shares of stock , according to his latest SEC filings .
6944 7069 The stock , held by half a dozen entities he controls , is worth about $ 83.5 million at the $ 48-a-share price on the table .
7070 7151 Kick the offer up to , say , $ 55 a share , and he 'd get more than $ 95 million .
7152 7301 That price would raise the total cost of the buyback from $ 288 million to $ 330 million , which Johnson and his partners ought to be able to afford .
7302 7462 BET has only $ 62 million in debt and generated $ 33 million in cash flow last year , more than enough to cover the interest on $ 330 million at today 's rates .
7463 7614 Johnson owns 20.9 percent of the stock , TCI holds 18.2 percent and 6.6 percent is under control of Capital Group Cos. , a Los Angeles investment firm .
7615 7772 Besides the common stock , which was sold to the public for $ 17 a share in 1991 , BET has two other classes of stock that are owned exclusively by insiders .
7773 7856 The Class B stock is entirely owned by TCI and the Class C stock is all Johnson 's .
7857 7946 Those two stocks have 10 voters per share , compared with one vote a share of the common .
7947 8077 As a practical matter , the public shareholders have no real voice in how BET is run and not much leverage in buyout negotiations .
8078 8147 That powerless position is all too familiar for Washington investors .
8148 8292 Dozens of corporations in the region are dominated by the entrepreneurs who started the company and then sold a minority interest to the public .
8293 8494 Horror stories abound , lead by the laments of shareholders held hostage by the Haft family 's previous domination of Dart Group Inc. , the Landover-based holding company for Crown Books and Trak Auto .
8495 8712 Given all the abuses that shareholders in those and other companies have suffered at the hands of insiders , BET 's stockholders now appear to have a good shot at getting a fair shake from Bob Johnson and John Malone .
8713 8755 They 'll need to thank Del Lewis for that .
8756 8814 How grateful they 'll be depends on Johnson 's next offer .
8814 8814 .
