0 500 9803.107 NEWS STORY SOURCE : The Washington Post SECTION : A24 LENGTH : 794 DATE : March 25 , 1998 HEADLINE : U.S. Urges Stronger Sanctions on Belgrade ; Albright Wages Uphill Fight on Kosovo BODY_LEN : 744 COLOGNE , Germany , March 24 - Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright today urged Russia and four other European nations to step up punitive sanctions against Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic until he shows greater cooperation in defusing the conflict in the Serbian province of Kosovo .
501 778 But as she arrived here to prepare for a meeting in Bonn Wednesday to discuss what to do about Kosovo , Albright appeared to be waging a lonely campaign to persuade others in the six-nation Balkans `` contact group '' to sustain a tough attitude toward the Yugoslav government .
779 1132 Only Britain shares the U.S. view that Milosevic , whose rump nation consists of Serbia and Montenegro , is more likely to respond to sticks than carrots in meeting demands that he withdraw special police units from Kosovo and make a serious effort to restore political autonomy to the 2 million Albanians who make up 90 percent of Kosovo 's population .
1133 1355 Russia , France , Italy and Germany have expressed varying degrees of satisfaction with Milosevic 's behavior since the contact group agreed to a series of sanctions against Yugoslavia at a meeting in London two weeks ago .
1356 1681 At that meeting , the group agreed to consider a comprehensive arms embargo against Serbia , Yugoslavia 's dominant republic , a halt to supplying equipment that could be used for repression , a denial of visas to Yugoslav officials involved in the crackdown and an end to export credits to Belgrade for trade and investment .
1682 1872 Russia , a long-standing ally of the Serbs and their main supplier of weapons , has spurned compliance with the comprehensive arms embargo and balked at further sanctions against Yugoslavia .
1873 2045 Albright held discussions here this evening with Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov , but there was no sign that Moscow was moving closer toward Washington 's views .
2046 2232 The contact group last met March 9 in the aftermath of a brutal crackdown on ethnic Albanians that followed a series of attacks by separatist guerrillas against Serbian police in Kosovo .
2233 2359 At least 80 people , many of them women and children , were killed by Serbian police and paramilitary forces in the crackdown .
2360 2534 The violence has subsided since then , although the province remains tense , especially in strongholds of the Kosovo Liberation Army , an Albanian separatist guerrilla group .
2535 2777 On Monday , Serbian and ethnic Albanian leaders signed an agreement that would allow Albanian high school and university students to return to state classrooms , seven years after Serbian authorities banned their Albanian-language curriculum .
2778 2980 During a six-hour stopover in Rome to consult with Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini and Vatican officials , Albright said Serbia 's response had not been sufficient to ease international pressure .
2981 3096 She called on the rest of the contact group to maintain sanctions until Yugoslavia complies fully with its demands .
3097 3222 `` We have seen too many diplomatic efforts fail to believe that President Milosevic will respond to positive pressure alone .
3223 3348 And if we give him even a shadow of a glimmer of a hint that he has done enough , he will assuredly do no more , '' she said .
3349 3426 She insisted that Milosevic has stopped far short of doing what is necessary .
3427 3621 `` Serbian security police are digging in , not pulling out ; Milosevic has still not committed himself to unconditional dialogue ; aid workers continue to be harassed , and the list goes on . ''
3622 3833 In contrast , Dini praised Milosevic for taking some steps in the right direction and said there was no reason for the group to be `` entirely dissatisfied '' with Yugoslavia 's behavior over the past two weeks .
3834 4046 During a visit to Belgrade last week , foreign ministers Klaus Kinkel of Germany and Hubert Vedrine of France told Milosevic they welcomed `` significant progress '' he showed toward meeting the group 's demands .
4047 4126 U.S. officials said they wanted to `` prevent backsliding '' toward Yugoslavia .
4127 4212 `` This is not the time to reverse course , '' a senior administration official said .
4213 4337 `` What we want is to be leading the group to understand that without pressure he -LRB- Milosevic -RRB- will not respond . ''
4338 4511 To show U.S. displeasure with Belgrade , Albright said she will sign an order barring 16 Yugoslav officials involved in the Kosovo crackdown from entering the United States .
4512 4623 `` We have too much experience in the former Yugoslavia to settle for half-sincere half measures , '' she said .
4624 4734 `` We will need to maintain credible pressure on Belgrade to end repression and restore autonomy '' in Kosovo .
4735 4852 But European allies predict that Milosevic will respond to encouraging gestures by taking further steps toward peace .
4853 5047 Some European companies want to see sanctions lifted so they can take advantage of early investments in Yugoslavia 's privatization plans , which they believe offer the prospect of easy profits .
