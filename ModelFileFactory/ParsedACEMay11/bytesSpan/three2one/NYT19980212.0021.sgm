Times News Service dLR ; dQC ; dQL ; NEW YORK _ Chances for the fastest mile in Madison Square Garden 's history improved markedly Wednesday when Laban Rotich of Kenya arrived in New York and was immediately switched from the Millrose Games ' 800 meters to the Wanamaker Mile .
549 722 Rotich is a tiny -LRB- 5 feet 4 inches , 99 pounds -RRB- 28-year-old who did not start running seriously until three years ago and had not competed indoors until this month .
723 745 He is a quick learner .
746 938 In his first indoor race , at Stuttgart , Germany , on Feb. 1 , he went 1,500 meters in 3 minutes 32.11 seconds , which is equivalent to a 3:49 mile and is the third-fastest indoor 1,500 ever .
939 996 That was on a 200-meter track with wide , sweeping turns .
997 1136 Friday night , he will have to contend with the tighter turns and shorter straightaways of Madison Square Garden 's 160-yards-per-lap oval .
1137 1184 He is happy to have been switched from the 800 .
1185 1257 `` From 800 to the mile was very nice for me , '' Rotich said Wednesday .
1258 1362 `` Because I am very small it takes a lot more energy for me to run with those big white men in the 800 .
1363 1410 In the mile I can run in front and run fast . ''
1411 1534 Although he is not sure how he will be able to handle the Garden track , Rotich thinks he can run `` about 3:53 or 3:52 . ''
1535 1595 The Millrose record is 3:53 , set by Eamonn Coghlan in 1981 .
1596 1668 The runner Rotich swapped places with is another Kenyan , William Tanui .
1669 1771 Tanui , the 1992 Olympic 800-meter gold medalist , has been running the mile for the last three years .
1772 1831 `` I 'm a little slower than I was in 1992 , '' Tanui said .
1832 1878 `` But I can still run 1:44 for 800 meters . ''
1879 2014 Tanui thinks Rotich 's small size will help him on the Garden track , but he is not sure how much the tighter turns will slow him down .
2015 2069 `` But I think he will run 3:54 , and maybe faster . ''
2070 2194 Rotich and Tanui are here with a third Kenyan , Robert Kibet , who is expected to set a fast pace for Rotich 's mile effort .
2195 2288 The three showed they are race-ready in a brief workout Wednesday at the Chelsea Piers track .
2289 2474 After a 10,000-meter warm-up running easy 6:40 miles , they ripped off a 55-second 400 meters followed by 200-meter blasts in 24.5 , 26 and 25.5 seconds with less than two minutes rest .
2475 2580 A fast pace may or may not lead to a new Garden record , but is almost certain to help Marcus O'Sullivan .
2581 2683 O'Sullivan , a five-time Wanamaker Mile winner , will be trying to run his 100th sub-four-minute mile .
