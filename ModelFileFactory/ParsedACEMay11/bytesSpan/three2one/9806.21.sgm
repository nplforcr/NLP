0 386 9806.21 NEWS STORY SOURCE : The Washington Post SECTION : A07 LENGTH : 603 DATE : June 29 , 1998 HEADLINE : Metrocall to Buy ATdT Paging Unit ; Telephone Giant Exits Market to Focus on Cellular Niche BODY_LEN : 579 ATdT Corp. is selling its electronic paging business to Alexandria-based paging giant Metrocall Inc. for $ 205 million in stock and cash , company sources said last night .
387 546 The move marks ATdT 's exit from the paging business , freeing the company to focus its wireless activities on its more profitable cellular telephone business .
547 690 It also would help , albeit in a small way , to provide the company with some of the cash it needs to buy cable giant Tele-Communications Inc. .
691 831 The deal is the latest in a string of acquisitions for Metrocall , the nation 's second-largest paging company with 4.1 million subscribers .
832 902 Metrocall employs 3,000 people , including 605 in the Washington area .
903 1036 Metrocall will pay $ 110 million in cash and $ 95 million in preferred shares for ATdT 's paging services , Metrocall officials said .
1037 1223 William L. Collins III , president and chief executive of Metrocall , said the two companies were in talks last fall , but Metrocall ended discussions because ATdT 's price was too high .
1224 1416 As part of the deal , Metrocall gets a nationwide two-way paging license for which ATdT paid $ 80 million at a federal auction in 1994 , though ATdT never developed the two-way paging service .
1417 1553 Metrocall also gets a five-year exclusive agreement to sell its paging products in ATdT Wireless retail stores under its own brand name .
1554 1725 `` ATdT is pleased that the advanced messaging division will be an important part of Metrocall 's overall strategy , '' said Dan Sommers , ATdT 's chief financial officer .
1726 1890 ATdT acquired its advanced messaging division , which employees 1,000 people , as part of its $ 11.5 billion purchase of McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. in 1995 .
1891 2096 Selling off ATdT 's paging unit is one of a series of moves made by the company 's new chairman , C. Michael Armstrong , to streamline the nation 's largest phone company and move it into new profit areas .
2097 2222 ATdT shares took a beating last week after the company announced plans to buy TCI for $ 48 billion in stock and assumed debt .
2223 2391 Analysts expressed concern that ATdT would have to spend too much money to upgrade TCI 's cable systems to make them capable of handling telephone and Internet service .
2392 2503 The paging deal furthers an acquisition frenzy that has characterized the industry over the past several years .
2504 2640 Large paging companies , seeking to reduce costs and enhance profitability , typically buy out smaller ones and take on their customers .
2641 2784 Metrocall has led that trend , making purchases of a half-dozen paging companies in the past few years , including rival ProNet Inc. last year .
2785 2932 With 4.1 million subscribers as of March 31 , Metrocall ranks behind Paging Network of Plano , Tex. , among the nation 's largest paging companies .
2933 3055 With 1.2 million subscribers , ATdT 's paging operations would rank 10th in the nation if it were a stand-alone operation .
3056 3118 Bulking up has been a costly strategy for Metrocall , however .
3119 3287 The company reported a net loss of $ 52.5 million in 1997 and lost $ 28.2 million its first quarter of 1998 , which was more than double the loss posted a year earlier .
3288 3377 Company officials attributed the losses to the cost of Metrocall 's acquisition strategy .
3378 3456 The company 's sales grew 59 percent in the first quarter , to $ 96.3 million .
3457 3548 Still , the ATdT deal might not be enough to maintain Metrocall 's No. 2 position for long .
3549 3776 Arch Communications Group Inc. , the third largest paging company with 4 million subscribers , recently announced that it was in talks to buy rival MobileMedia Corp. , which filed for bankruptcy protection more than a year ago .
3777 3848 MobileMedia is the fourth-largest company , with 3.3 million customers .
