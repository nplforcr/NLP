412 579 According to the latest survey of 3,000 people , one in two participants , or 52 percent , supports the death penalty , which was abolished in the Netherlands in 1870 .
580 643 In previous surveys , support ranged between 40 and 45 percent .
644 796 Survey investigator Dr. Karin Wittebrood said Thursday it is difficult to establish what had triggered the increase , but timing may have been a factor .
797 993 The study was conducted during the latter part of 1996 when publicity over the Marc Dutroux child-murder case in neighboring Belgium reached its height and public concerns spilled over the border .
994 1116 Wittebrood said many of those who support the death penalty said it should be imposed for murder , incest and child abuse .
1117 1259 Although the rise reflects a significant change in public opinion , Wittebrood believes the change is only temporary in this tolerant country .
1260 1383 The survey also showed that supporters of the death penalty are mostly young people or those with a low level of education .
1384 1525 The survey , carried out by the Netherlands Institute for the Study of Crime and Law Enforcement , was conducted via face-to-face interviews .
1526 1564 Its margin of error was not disclosed .
