478 819 While European allies have closed ranks behind the United States in the latest showdown with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein , there are lingering apprehensions among NATO governments about the Clinton administration 's insistence on recognizing the spread of nuclear , biological and chemical weapons as the alliance 's most urgent priority .
820 1146 At a meeting of NATO foreign ministers here two months ago , Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright pointed to the looming fight with Iraq and declared that banishing the weapons of mass destruction of rogue states should become the new `` unifying threat '' that binds Europe and the United States in the post-Cold War era .
1147 1238 Albright cited weapons proliferation as `` the overriding security interest of our time . ''
1239 1544 She also has urged that an expanding North Atlantic Treaty Organization -- which will embrace Poland , Hungary and the Czech Republic as full members next year -- must extend its geographic reach beyond the European continent and evolve into `` a force for peace from the Middle East to Central Africa . ''
1545 1761 Senior French officials say their government is wary of expanding NATO 's geographic reach because it fears the alliance would become little more than a multinational military machine to assert global U.S. interests .
1762 1872 While France 's skepticism about U.S. intentions is well-known , other European allies voice similar concerns .
1873 2007 `` If NATO is changing a military destiny once based on geography to a defense of common values , then where do we draw the limits ? ''
2008 2041 asked a senior European diplomat .
2042 2092 `` Will we all agree on which values to fight for ?
2093 2142 And just how far do we then go to defend them ? ''
2143 2383 U.S. Ambassador to NATO Alexander Vershbow said Albright 's suggestions were primarily intended to stimulate discussion of a `` strategic concept '' being prepared for a summit in Washington next April to celebrate NATO 's 50th anniversary .
2384 2699 While the debate is still in its early stages , Vershbow said in an interview that the United States wants the new strategic statement `` to lay out a bold vision for the next century and to provide practical guidance to our military structures on how resources can be shifted to meet these new kinds of threats . ''
2700 2926 He said the United States considers it necessary for European governments to expand their power-projection capabilities to relieve some of the burdens on American forces in defending alliance security interests outside Europe .
2927 3049 Failure to do so , he said , could lead to erosion of U.S. support `` if the allies are seen to be getting a free ride . ''
3050 3390 Albright addressed this perceptual problem at the December meeting , telling her European colleagues that `` too often , the United States takes the heat for dealing with difficult issues while others take the contracts -- and that our willingness to take responsibility for peace and security makes it easier for others to shirk theirs . ''
3391 3661 A recent study by the Western European Union , a defense-oriented affiliate of the European Union , found that its 10 member nations were so feeble in projecting military power that they could not sustain long-term deployment of more than one division or three brigades .
3662 3827 In an era of high joblessness and meager defense budgets , European governments appear reluctant to devote greater resources to coping with distant or murky threats .
3828 4097 Some European officials said they were outraged recently when visiting U.S. senators demanded Europe 's unflinching support for American global initiatives , including a military attack against Iraq , as fair compensation for U.S. security commitments on the continent .
4098 4298 `` Make no mistake : There is a direct relationship between decisions taken on Iraq in the next weeks and months and the future of U.S. support for NATO , '' warned Sen. John Warner -LRB- R.-Va . -RRB-
4299 4346 at a Munich defense seminar earlier this month .
4347 4435 Warner 's statement was described as `` blackmail '' by several European diplomats here .
4436 4590 `` Whatever happens in Iraq , blind support for every policy dictated by Washington can not be the basis of this alliance , '' said a European ambassador .
4591 4775 American appeals to stretch alliance interests beyond NATO 's territorial domain reflect a longstanding argument between the United States and Europe over `` out of area '' activities .
4776 5004 But the relative success of the NATO-led peacekeeping mission in Bosnia has emboldened the United States to promote NATO initiatives for the Balkans , the Middle East and Africa that would have been unthinkable in Cold War days .
