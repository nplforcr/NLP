580 664 To get to the heart of Elbrick 's story , filmmakers went to his daughter , Valerie .
665 703 Her memories came as quite a surprise .
704 769 Her first reaction uh when her father was kidnapped was jealousy .
770 787 And I said , why ?
788 924 And she said , because they were going to get , they were going to have my daddy only for them and I had never had my daddy only for me .

1083 1217 And very h - his emotions were much more on the surface than they had ever been a - th - we 'll have to write the letter to your wife .
1218 1305 They want to proof that you 're alive so that she will relax , we 'll all relax , okay ?
1306 1353 I remember things like that with my own father .

1393 1579 My father knew everything , so I don - I remember the day that Roosevelt died , and I was excited about it because I had something that I could tell him that he wouldn - he did n't know .
1580 1623 So it 's the same kind of thing , in a way .
