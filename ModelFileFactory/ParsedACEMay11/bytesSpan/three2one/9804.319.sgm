0 442 9804.319 NEWS STORY SOURCE : The Washington Post SECTION : A01 LENGTH : 1063 DATE : April 10 , 1998 HEADLINE : Ex-Aide to Rep. Shuster Indicted ; Eppard Accused of Taking Illegal Payments on Highway Project BODY_LEN : 1033 Charles R. Babcock ; Eric Pianin , Washington Post Staff Writers Ann Eppard , who became an influential transportation lobbyist through her close alliance with House Transportation Chairman Bud Shuster -LRB- R-Pa . -RRB-
443 626 , was indicted by a federal grand jury yesterday for allegedly taking $ 230,000 in illegal payments to influence a massive Boston highway project while serving as Shuster 's top aide .
627 871 Eppard , 55 , also was charged with embezzling $ 27,500 from Shuster 's campaign committee -- she served as its assistant treasurer -- by allegedly arranging phony payments for a consultant who then returned the money to her through a relative .
872 1037 Since the Republican takeover of Congress in 1994 , Shuster has become one of the most powerful House committee chairmen , overseeing the $ 217 billion highway bill .
1038 1147 But at the same time , Shuster has been under investigation by the grand jury that indicted Eppard yesterday .
1148 1284 He has also been the subject of a separate House Ethics Committee investigation of his dealings with Eppard after she became a lobbyist .
1285 1570 U.S. Attorney Donald Stern in Boston said in a statement that no one else in Shuster 's office participated in the seven-count indictment 's list of crimes , which occurred before Eppard left Shuster 's staff after the 1994 election , but he added that the investigation is continuing .
1571 1821 In a statement yesterday , Shuster called Eppard `` one of the finest , most decent and dedicated persons I have ever known , '' predicted she will be `` totally vindicated '' and termed the accusations `` a political indictment , pure and simple . ''
1822 1974 Eppard 's lawyer , Richard M. Egbert , said she `` vehemently denies these allegations '' and the grand jury probe `` smacks of political motivation . ''
1975 2199 Eppard , who opened her own lobbying firm after the 1994 GOP victory that propelled Shuster to the chairmanship , has carved out a lucrative specialty as a transportation lobbyist representing clients before her former boss .
2200 2341 She also has continued to serve as a $ 3,000-a-month consultant for Shuster 's campaign and tapped her lobbying clients to contribute to him .
2342 2497 Her lobbying firm , Ann Eppard Associates Ltd. , reported billings of more than $ 1 million in 1996 , the most recent year for which figures are available .
2498 2725 The indictment names both Eppard and Washington lobbyist , Vernon A. Clark , 68 , charging them with conspiracy , mail fraud and wire fraud for a scheme allegedly dating back to 1989 , when Eppard was Shuster 's chief of staff .
2726 2944 It alleges that Eppard received illegal gratuities from Clark and two Boston businessmen seeking her help in fighting plans to take their land for a multibillion-dollar underground highway project known as the Big Dig .
2945 3078 Some of the gratuities were in the form of loans and disguised by being funneled to a relative of Eppard 's , the indictment alleges .
3079 3220 Although not named in the indictment , the relative is Eppard 's son Ralph , who operates a Chrysler dealership on Maryland 's Eastern Shore .
3221 3392 Sources familiar with the probe have said Stern 's office is investigating Shuster and has been trying to get Clark to provide evidence against the congressman and Eppard .
3393 3568 Clark , who first met Shuster and Eppard years ago while lobbying for the billboard industry , was indicted in Boston on unrelated conspiracy and tax fraud charges last month .
3569 3633 His attorney , Brendan Sullivan , declined to comment yesterday .
3634 3809 In his statement , Stern said the alleged gratuities were not disclosed by Eppard , `` often were disguised with phony documents , and represented a breach of public trust . ''
3810 4057 In a series of interviews for a Washington Post Magazine story published Sunday , Eppard portrayed herself as a woman without financial means beyond her congressional salary , which ranged from $ 67,000 to $ 110,000 in her last decade on the Hill .
4058 4156 She said she borrowed heavily from her government retirement fund to pay for her son 's education .
4157 4229 In 1995 , she told a reporter , `` I 'm a woman with five Visa cards . ''
4230 4362 In December 1994 , she bought a waterfront town house in Alexandria for $ 823,000 after signing up a handful of well-paying clients .
4363 4445 Early last year , she traded up to a $ 1.4 million town house in the same complex .
4446 4541 By last year , her small lobbying shop was billing clients at the rate of $ 1.4 million a year .
4542 4794 The 31-page indictment outlined an alleged scheme that began in 1989 when Richard Goldberg , part-owner of a parking lot near Logan International Airport , and another businessman hired Clark to help them fight plans to take their land for the Big Dig .
4795 4983 News accounts in Boston have identified Nicholas Contos , owner of a restaurant , as a cooperating witness in the inquiry who acknowledged making a loan to Ralph Eppard 's auto dealership .
4984 5142 According to the indictment , Goldberg paid $ 10,000 in consulting fees to Eppard 's relative in 1990 , and Clark paid the relative $ 15,000 in 1989 and 1991 .
5143 5217 In 1991 , Goldberg and Contos reached separate deals on the land disputes .
5218 5293 After that , Clark made $ 130,000 in favorable loans to Eppard 's relative .
5294 5385 The other businessman made an Eppard-solicited $ 75,000 loan to the relative in early 1992 .
5386 5449 That was about the time Ralph Eppard opened his car dealership .
5450 5622 Eppard used her relative as a `` straw '' on one $ 30,000 loan from Clark she needed to finance the purchase of a town house in Alexandria in 1993 , the indictment charges .
5623 5850 Though the relative received much of the money , Eppard herself benefited because her son 's dealership paid her $ 10,300 in the spring of 1993 and $ 100,000 from November 1994 to February 1995 , and gave her free use of a car .
5851 6012 The indictment also listed several `` official acts '' it said Eppard took on behalf of Clark and his clients from 1989 to 1994 , when she left Shuster 's staff .
6013 6200 In late 1993 , for example , it said Eppard spoke with a Conrail employee on behalf of Clark 's unnamed client , Contos , about altering its 1991 land agreement with the restaurant owner .
6201 6333 Shuster and Eppard met in Washington in 1969 when Shuster , a computer business executive , hired Eppard as his executive assistant .
6334 6535 Eppard followed Shuster into congressional politics in the early 1970s and emerged as a political force in Washington and Pennsylvania as his chief of staff , chief fund-raiser and political alter ego .
6536 6746 Although Shuster rarely attracted an opponent , he and Eppard raised and spent millions on activities that were tangentially related to campaigning , according to reviews of Federal Election Commission records .
