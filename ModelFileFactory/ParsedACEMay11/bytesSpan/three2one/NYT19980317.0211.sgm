Times News Service dLR ; dQC ; dQL ; NEW YORK _ The printed menu does n't count for too much at Manducatis , an Italian restaurant in Long Island City , Queens .
452 652 Regulars simply ask for whatever 's cooking in the kitchen , have a brief consultation with the owner , a scholarly looking Neapolitan named Vincenzo Cerbone , and eat what his wife , Ida , turns out .
653 786 There 's one dish that always appears midway between the appetizers and the entree -LRB- or entrees -RRB- , and it 's a show stopper .
787 1031 A small pile of homemade fettuccine _ sometimes plain , sometimes spinach _ is woven together with meaty slices of sauteed portobello mushrooms and plum tomatoes , which Cerbone accumulates in season and stockpiles in glass jars for the winter .
1032 1178 The dish , earthy and intensely flavored , is heady with garlic and basil , and a touch of hot red pepper gives it a subtle but unmistakable zing .
1179 1300 When it comes to the table and its fragrant cloud rises , it takes a disciplined diner not to throw himself on the plate .
1301 1327 `` Manducatis '' is Latin .
1328 1351 It means `` you eat . ''
