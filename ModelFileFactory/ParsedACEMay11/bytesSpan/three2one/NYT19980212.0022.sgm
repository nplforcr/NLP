PATRICK 'S DAY PARADE IS ACQUITTED dLR ; dQL ; -LRB- gh -RRB- dQL ; dUR ; By JOHN SULLIVAN dLR ; dQC ; dQL ; dUR ; c. 1998 N.Y. Times News Service dLR ; dQC ; dQL ; NEW YORK _ A Brooklyn teen-ager charged with killing a high school student during a brawl at last year 's St. Patrick 's Day parade was acquitted of all counts Wednesday by a Manhattan jury .
544 658 Jason Andrade , 19 , of Bay Ridge , was found not guilty of charges that he beat Michael Sarti , 18 , into a coma .
659 790 Sarti , a high school senior who lived in the Throgs Neck section of the Bronx , died of his injuries three weeks after the attack .
791 954 Although prosecutors claimed that Andrade delivered a fatal kick to Sarti , the defense managed to raise questions about descriptions of the attacker by witnesses .
955 1007 `` It was justice , '' Andrade said after the trial .
1008 1032 `` Justice prevailed . ''
1033 1112 The verdict was announced in a courtroom crowded with members of both families .
1113 1228 While defense supporters sagged with relief , members of Sarti 's family cried that the acquittal was an injustice .
1229 1395 Sarti 's brother , Jimmy Watt , leaped to his feet and had to be restrained by court officers as the jury forewoman read `` not guilty '' to the 11th and final count .
1396 1496 Sarti 's mother screamed , `` They all have his blood on their hands , '' as she left the courtroom .
1497 1663 Prosecutors said Sarti was beaten just after 2 p.m. last March 17 during an alcohol-fueled brawl a block east of the parade route , at 59th Street and Madison Avenue .
1664 1830 The fighting that led to Sarti 's death was the culmination of a series of street battles between groups of teen-agers from Brooklyn and the Bronx , prosecutors said .
1831 1938 They claimed that the fatal assault ended with Andrade kicking Sarti in the head as he lay on the pavement .
1939 2052 But defense lawyers produced medical experts who questioned whether such a kick could have led to Sarti 's death .
2053 2246 More significantly , the defense lawyers were able to raise questions about varying descriptions of the attacker , focusing on details like whether the man wore a hat and the color of his hair .
2247 2368 Although prosecutors had a videotape of portions of the fight , there was no tape that showed the final assault on Sarti .
2369 2527 One juror , Anthony Sbordoni , 51 , said after the verdict that questions about the identification decided the case during the two half-days of deliberations .
2528 2615 `` There was not enough substantial evidence regarding the identification , '' he said .
2616 2647 `` There was no consistency . ''
2648 2769 After the verdict , Andrade 's lawyer , Raphael Scotto , said that Andrade and his family felt compassion for the Sartis .
2770 2834 `` It was a fair verdict based on the evidence , '' Scotto said .
2835 2962 `` The verdict does not take away in any part from the fact that the Andrade family has great sympathy for the Sarti family . ''
2963 3085 Andrade 's father , Robert , said the family was relieved that his son was freed , but that there would be no celebrating .
3086 3131 `` There is no celebration here , '' he said .
3132 3152 `` A boy is dead . ''
3153 3333 The beating took place during an intensive effort by the Giuliani administration and the Police Department to curtail drinking and violence at the annual St. Patrick 's Day Parade .
3334 3436 Chris Bonaiuto , 18 , who worked with Sarti at a Bronx hobby shop , expressed dismay with the verdict .
3437 3542 `` It shows people that you can go to a parade and hurt somebody and get away with it , '' Bonaiuto said .
3543 3570 `` It 's totally unfair . ''
