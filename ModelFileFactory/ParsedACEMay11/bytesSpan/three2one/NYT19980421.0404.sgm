Times News Service dLR ; dQC ; NEW YORK _ Leather skirts , fishnet stockings and a pink feather boa were deployed on behalf of the First Amendment Tuesday as about 30 strippers and lap dancers rallied in City Hall Park to protest Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani 's crackdown on sex shops and clubs .
578 733 The dancers were joined by about 70 supporters as they marched around a fountain not far from the mayor 's office , chanting : `` Giuliani _ scared of sex !
734 768 Who 's he going to censor next ? ''
769 866 Giuliani 's hulking white GMC Suburban 2500 was parked in the driveway , a signal that he was in .
867 960 But he was among the few workers in the area who resisted gawking at the lunchtime spectacle .
961 1046 `` This is my first time , '' said Matthew Huang , 32 , a paralegal who works nearby .
1047 1077 `` How often are they here ? ''
1078 1418 Depending on a court 's action , the Giuliani administration could begin as soon as Monday its enforcement of a new zoning law prohibiting X-rated businesses within 500 feet of homes , schools , churches or one another _ a provision intended to make it harder for the businesses to operate and to keep them in the less savory neighborhoods .
1419 1670 Elissa Wald , a 28-year-old dancer who said she worked at several clubs including `` Dangerous Curves , in midtown Manhattan , '' carried a double-sided sign that read `` I Strip and I Vote '' on the front and `` Will Strip for Liberty '' on the back .
1671 1738 `` This law would put thousands of women out of work , '' she said .
1739 1780 `` Everyone 's sex lives are at stake . ''
1781 1898 The law would require all but about 20 of the city 's 150 sex businesses to move or close , city officials have said .
1899 2143 Enforcement of the law has been postponed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit until Monday , when a three-judge panel in the court is to hear arguments about whether the law violates the First Amendment guarantee of free speech .
2144 2257 Randy M. Mastro , the deputy mayor for operations , said Tuesday that he expected the panel to rule for the city .
2258 2349 `` This is their last dance , '' he said , shortly after the strippers ended their protest .
2350 2619 Norman Siegel , executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union , which represents several customers who are challenging the sex-shop ban , said the rally was intended to warn voters that their city was becoming `` increasingly authoritarian and repressive . ''
2620 2811 The demonstrators did not seek a permit until less than two hours before the protest was scheduled to begin , said Edward Skyler , a spokesman for the city 's Parks and Recreation Department .
2812 2990 But police officers , who had set up barricades to prevent the demonstrators from getting too near City Hall , said they allowed the protest to proceed as long as it was orderly .
2991 3095 Viva Knievel , 26 , posed for photographs of the word `` Go-Go '' spelled in sequins across her sweater .
3096 3213 And Lola Urena , 26 , a burlesque stripper , described herself as `` just a normal person trying to make a living . ''
3214 3426 Among the patrons who came out in support of the strip clubs was William MacLeod , a 32-year-old real estate broker who said most people did not realize that many of the clubs have a largely mainstream clientele .
3427 3490 `` Dirty old men only account for maybe 5 percent , '' he said .
3491 3562 `` This law is n't going to stop any topless clubs or fully nude clubs .
3563 3613 They just wo n't have a neon sign out in front . ''
3614 3691 Alyssa Simon , 28 , a dancer for the last seven years , did not seem so sure .
3692 3824 `` The powers that be , '' she said , `` are not going to listen to a bunch of strippers and bouncers walking around in a circle . ''
