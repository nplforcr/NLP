0 66 ABC19980629 .1830.1520 NEWS STORY Finally tonight , the new China .
67 175 Everyone involved with the President 's trip to China has referred to the new China in one way or the other .
176 292 During our own visit ten days ago , we did n't quite get the full import of what people meant until we saw Shanghai .
293 363 This is a part of Shanghai called Pudong photographed eight years ago .
364 393 Pudong was all farmland then .
394 447 And this is Pudong just before the President arrived .
448 499 Shanghai is the world 's largest construction site .
500 582 Everywhere you turn in Shanghai these days , something is coming down or going up .
583 630 Old neighborhoods are being turned into rubble .
631 745 We were there on the eighty-eighth floor as they finished off the tallest building in China the old fashioned way .
746 808 The driving force behind all of this is the mayor of Shanghai .
809 877 It was his idea to have the sky line as the backdrop when we talked .
878 939 Xu Kuangdi once said his city is much like the United States .
940 985 Like New York City , not whole United States .
986 1032 I think Shanghai is the Chinese New York City .
1033 1062 And what do you mean by that ?
1063 1086 Peoples walk very fast .
1087 1150 Aggre - Aggressive people want to do some business immediately .
1151 1186 Fourteen million people in a hurry .
1187 1251 In the Shanghainese dialect , the word for walk is actually run .
1252 1334 They are running here to compete with Hong Kong and Singapore in the next century .
1335 1454 For almost a hundred years , from eighteen forty-two until the second world war , Shanghai was controlled by Europeans .
1455 1558 The Chinese have decided to preserve the famous bund , where the docks used to be on the River Huangpo .
1559 1649 But safeguarding a European heritage is very much secondary to making something brand new .
1650 1756 Tess Johnston is an American living here who has written a lot about the old Shanghai , which she prefers .
1757 1927 If some uh Hong Kong fat cat or Taiwan fat cat were to offer them a zillion dollars for that site right there , you would be amazed at how fast it would probably go down .
1928 2012 There are all sorts of problems here , too much housing for those who can afford it .
2013 2037 Half of these are empty .
2038 2070 Not enough housing for the poor .
2071 2104 Not enough public transportation .
2105 2170 Too many cars in a city where there were hardly any a decade ago .
2171 2231 Still , this is China 's most progressive city in every way .
2232 2323 And when you ask about China 's future , here in Shanghai they say , You 're looking at it .
2324 2429 Not long ago , a Shanghai man is said to have written to a friend overseas who was contemplating a visit .
2430 2491 Do n't come yet , said the Shanghai man , It is n't finished .
2491 2491 .
