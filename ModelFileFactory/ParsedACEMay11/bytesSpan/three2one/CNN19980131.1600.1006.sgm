135 219 They have found the drug could increase the chances of sudden infant death syndrome .
220 243 Rhonda Rowland reports .
244 333 Most doctors advise pregnant women to avoid coffee , tea and other caffeinated beverages .
334 395 Studies have linked them to miscarriage and low birth weight .
396 534 Now a new study , this one published in the Archives of Disease in Childhood shows caffeine consumption during pregnancy may lead to SIDS .
535 731 There 's evidence , not great , but evidence that babies who go on to die of SIDS are not normal even from their very first day of life , which means it 's happening sometime prior to tha - birth .
732 887 The study shows heavy caffeine consumption , that is , drinking four or more cups of coffee a day throughout pregnancy , almost doubled the chance of SIDS .
888 996 Researchers suggest the reason may be that high levels of caffeine may alter the fetus ' respiratory system .
997 1110 Caffeine is a drug , you know , and it has a generalized effect , not only on the mother but as well as the baby .
1111 1203 I - it has an effect on the respiratory centers of the fetus , it should drive respirations .
1204 1255 Whether that has a long term effect , no one knows .
1256 1322 The number of babies dying from SIDS has declined in recent years .
1323 1456 Some attribute it to the fact that more parents are putting their babies to sleep on their backs rather than their sides or stomachs .
1457 1543 Researchers say more studies are needed looking at the link between caffeine and SIDS .
1544 1654 In the meantime , they suggest pregnant women stop or limit their coffee drinking to no more than a cup a day .
