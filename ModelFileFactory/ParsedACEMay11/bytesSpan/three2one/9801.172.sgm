0 358 9801.172 NEWS STORY SOURCE : The Washington Post SECTION : A01 LENGTH : 1474 DATE : January 22 , 1998 HEADLINE : FBI Taped Aide 's Allegations ; Clinton Denies Affair , Says He ` Did Not Urge Anyone ' to Lie BODY_LEN : 1412 President Clinton had planned weeks ago to devote yesterday to building up public interest in next week 's State of the Union address .
359 567 Instead , he spent his afternoon with a revolving door of reporters , in a campaign to keep his presidency from buckling under the force of allegations about his relationship with a former White House intern .
568 834 In a remarkable series of three interviews in which the president was questioned bluntly and without apology about adultery and obstruction of justice alike , Clinton denied having had a sexual relationship with a then-White House aide , 24-year-old Monica Lewinsky .
835 970 But he also repeatedly refused to say whether he ever discussed with Lewinsky how she should answer questions about their relationship .
971 1175 Appearing on PBS 's `` NewsHour With Jim Lehrer , '' Clinton emphatically denied that he had encouraged Lewinsky to lie to attorneys seeking a statement from her in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case .
1176 1275 At the same time , he brushed aside requests to explain his relationship or conversations with her .
1276 1358 `` I did not urge anyone to say anything that was untrue , '' Clinton told Lehrer .
1359 1393 `` That 's my statement to you . ''
1394 1608 It was precisely this suspicion that had engulfed the White House yesterday in a furor that aides acknowledged threatens to be the gravest legal and political challenge Clinton has faced in five years as president .
1609 1933 An allegation that Clinton and Washington lawyer Vernon E. Jordan Jr. , one of the president 's closest advisers , coached Lewinsky to commit perjury in the Jones case prompted Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr on Friday to secretly seek and gain authority from a three-judge panel to expand his investigation .
1934 2159 Only late Tuesday evening did Clinton and his lawyers learn of Starr 's new avenue and of the potentially damaging evidence -- including taped conversations between Lewinsky and a former co-worker -- he has already assembled .
2160 2397 Within hours of the news of the allegations breaking at midnight Tuesday , the White House was in the midst of a full-blown media frenzy , with senior aides and lawyers meeting and talking by phone through the night about how to respond .
2398 2642 The most important element of the response came from Clinton himself -- in three previously scheduled interviews he gave carefully worded statements that denied some of the most unseemly allegations but left other pressing questions unanswered .
2643 2801 Clinton earlier in the day issued a statement denying that he had any `` improper relationship , '' but as the day wore on he was pressed to be more specific .
2802 2892 `` The relationship was not sexual , '' Clinton told Roll Call , a Capitol Hill newspaper .
2893 3071 `` And I know what you mean , and the answer is no. '' Clinton told National Public Radio that his answers to questions about Lewinsky were constrained by Starr 's investigation .
3072 3212 NPR reporter Mara Liasson asked Clinton `` whether you had any conversations with her about her testimony , had any conversations at all . ''
3213 3335 The president responded : `` I think given the state of this investigation , it would be inappropriate for me to say more .
3336 3396 I 've said everything , I think , that I need to say now . ''
3397 3594 Clinton advisers inside and outside the White House acknowledged how unlikely these clipped answers are to satisfy the public 's demand for reassurance that Clinton and Jordan did nothing improper .
3595 3699 And , uncharacteristically , they made scarcely any effort to play down the severity of their situation .
3700 3858 Even in a White House that long ago learned to prosper amid political and legal controversies , the latest allegations exploded like a bomb on a quiet street .
3859 4423 Administration officials who had believed they had withstood the worst of the Whitewater and Democratic fund-raising investigations recited a long list of new problems : The allegations , unless effectively and swiftly rebutted , threaten to swamp Clinton in a perilous new criminal investigation , aides said ; they promise to overwhelm public attention that would ordinarily be devoted to the policies and rhetoric Clinton will present in Tuesday 's prime-time State of the Union speech , and already they have badly undermined morale at the Clinton White House .
4424 4636 Many present and former officials in the middle and lower ranks acknowledged privately that they did not see Clinton 's careful statements yesterday as anything like the full-throated denial they were hoping for .
4637 4849 And many of these people -- who regularly denounced the Whitewater and fund-raising probes as partisan vendettas -- said they could scarcely defend their boss if the new charges turn out to be substantially true .
4850 5033 `` I hope he did n't do these things , but if he did he should resign , he should n't be president , '' said one administration official who started with Clinton in the 1992 campaign .
5034 5348 Instead of dismissing the allegations as patently absurd , several people placed their hope on more narrow grounds : Would it really be logistically possible for the president to carry out the two-year sexual relationship that sources said Lewinsky has claimed in the taped conversations with the former co-worker ?
5349 5397 Could it be that Lewinsky had fabricated a tale ?
5398 5512 For senior White House officials , the day began with an injunction not to concern themselves with such questions .
5513 5771 Chief of Staff Erskine B. Bowles , at the 7:45 a.m. senior staff meeting , made what aides described as a short , grim speech in which he noted the morning 's headlines but reminded his team that Clinton had faced similar crises and distractions in the past .
5772 5918 He told everyone to concentrate on their work and turned the floor over to national economic adviser Gene Sperling for a discussion of tax policy .
5919 5987 But few people around the White House were interested in tax policy .
5988 6060 `` There 's an air of unreality here , '' said one White House official .
6061 6153 Many staff members talking with reporters grilled them on the latest of what they had heard .
6154 6207 Many said they spent the day glued to the television .
6208 6304 Portions of Clinton 's interview with NPR and PBS were carried live on major broadcast networks .
6305 6572 CNN went live with White House press secretary Michael McCurry 's daily briefing , which was uncommonly jammed with reporters and was dominated by extended but unilluminating exchanges over what precisely Clinton was denying and what , if anything , he was admitting .
6573 6742 Repeatedly , McCurry was asked what constituted an `` improper relationship , '' each time falling back on a similar response : `` I 'm not going to parse the statement .
6743 6812 You 've got the statement I made earlier and it speaks for itself . ''
6813 6962 Likewise , first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton , on a day trip to Baltimore to speak at a college , found herself pressed for a response on the uproar .
6963 7040 `` Can you say that you flatly believe these latest accusations are false ? ''
7041 7058 a reporter asked .
7059 7114 `` Certainly I believe they 're false , '' she replied .
7115 7132 `` Absolutely . ''
7133 7225 Asked if the publicity was difficult for her to endure , the first lady acknowledged it was .
7226 7276 `` You know , I would n't say that it is not hard .
7277 7455 It is difficult and painful any time someone you care about , you love , you admire is attacked and subjected to such relentless accusations as my husband has been , '' she said .
7456 7519 `` But I also have now lived with this for more than six years .
7520 7616 And I have seen how these charges evaporate and disappear as they 're given the light of day . ''
7617 7820 Last night , the president donned a black tie and the first lady a formal evergreen suit to preside at a White House dinner to celebrate the completion of a $ 25 million fund for White House restoration .
7821 7983 As if White House staff members needed to be told of the severity of the charges , some of the key political advisers of the first term were there to remind them .
7984 8133 Former White House senior adviser George Stephanopoulos , now an analyst for ABC News , offered a pungent assessment on `` Good Morning , America . ''
8134 8232 `` These are probably the most serious allegations yet leveled against the president , '' he said .
8233 8371 `` There 's no question that ... if they 're true , they 're not only politically damaging , but it could lead to impeachment proceedings .
8372 8572 `` But they are just questions right now , and that 's why I think we do all have to take a deep breath before we go too far here , without underestimating their seriousness , '' Stephanopoulos added .
8573 8833 Political consultant James Carville , who remains an informal adviser to the Clinton White House and is often the Clinton team 's designated point man for attacking Starr , said it is imperative for Clinton 's future that the charges be dispensed with quickly .
8834 8985 `` The president said they 're not true ; I believe it , '' Carville said in an interview , acknowledging that many in the public will want more proof .
8986 9131 `` We 've got to get to the bottom of it and fast ... This could be the most-talked-about -LRB- controversy -RRB- in modern political history . ''
