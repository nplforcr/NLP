0 610 9804.234 NEWS STORY SOURCE : The Washington Post SECTION : A26 LENGTH : 976 DATE : April 16 , 1998 HEADLINE : Khmer Rouge Leader Pol Pot Reported Dead ; Cambodia , Thailand Demand to See Body of Man Who Caused Millions of Deaths BODY_LEN : 962 HONG KONG , April 16 -LRB- Thursday -RRB- HONG KONG , April 16 -LRB- Thursday -RRB- Pol Pot , the notorious yet enigmatic Khmer Rouge leader whose reign of terror in Cambodia left more than 2 million people dead but who was later denounced by his own movement , was reported by his former comrades to have died peacefully in his sleep late Wednesday night at age 73 .
611 769 In the last known film of him taken in July , a white-haired Pol Pot appeared frail and sickly , suffering from malaria and unable to walk without assistance .
770 1130 Since then , he has been under house arrest by the colleagues he once commanded , even as their numbers have dwindled to a few hundred because of defections and as their last jungle redoubt has become encircled by Cambodian government troops about to finish off the guerrilla movement and close off for good the bloodiest chapter in Cambodia 's tragic history .
1131 1251 If his death is confirmed , it would mark an anticlimactic end for one of history 's most ruthless human rights abusers .
1252 1462 Just days ago , his capture by Cambodian troops seemed certain , and Clinton administration officials were heady with the prospects of bringing Pol Pot before an international tribunal to answer for his crimes .
1463 1578 Today , however , officials in various capitals were seeking independent confirmation that Pol Pot was indeed dead .
1579 1758 A Khmer Rouge official named Nuon Nou , who had been responsible for guarding Pol Pot , informed Thai military officials early today of the death of the group 's disgraced leader .
1759 1962 But by midday today , Thai officials in Bangkok said they could not confirm that Pol Pot was dead without independent verification , which might include photographs of the corpse or else the actual body .
1963 2087 A Thai official said a military team was crossing the border into Cambodia to try to confirm the report of Pol Pot 's death .
2088 2189 `` If he is really dead , presumably they would want to provide some evidence , '' the official said .
2190 2391 Noting that past reports of Pol Pot 's death and his supposed retirement from active leadership have proven untrue , the official , speaking by telephone , said , `` We 've been through this before . ''
2392 2478 `` It was a verbal report made by a Khmer Rouge official to our officers , '' he said .
2479 2544 `` The field officers are of the view that it looks pretty valid .
2545 2577 They gave a lot of weight to it .
2578 2669 But the central authorities here in Bangkok have asked for any independent verification . ''
2670 2785 In Washington , State Department officials also said they had no independent confirmation whether Pol Pot was dead .
2786 2989 In Phnom Penh , the Cambodian capital , news of Pol Pot 's death was greeted with caution and some skepticism , with officials also demanding to see the body before believing the reports from the jungle .
2990 3347 There was some speculation that if Pol Pot were dead , his former colleagues may have simply eliminated him to prevent Cambodian troops from capturing him , or to avoid having to turn him over to an international tribunal whose proceedings might have cast an unwelcome spotlight back on the Khmer Rouge 's bloody rule of Cambodia from April 1975 until 1979 .
3348 3427 `` Maybe they just got rid of him , '' one Thai Foreign Ministry official said .
3428 3591 In Phnom Penh , Khieu Kanarith , the government spokesman , demanded an autopsy , saying , `` We request whoever has his body to turn it over to the government . ''
3592 3646 He added , `` There are a lot of coincidences here . ''
3647 3795 The Associated Press quoted the Khmer Rouge official , Nuon Nou , as denying any foul play in Pol Pot 's death , saying he died from heart problems .
3796 3923 Nuon Nou reportedly told the Associated Press by telephone that the guerrillas had taken photographs of the corpse as evidence .
3924 4249 In a story based on interviews on April 11 , American journalist Nate Thayer , who last talked with Pol Pot in October , reported in the Far Eastern Economic Review magazine that Nuon Nou and other hard-line Khmer Rouge holdouts were ready to turn Pol Pot over to an international tribunal but were uncertain whom to contact .
4250 4354 Thayer suggested the guerrillas contact the International Red Cross , according to the magazine account .
4355 4699 It was 23 years ago this week that Pol Pot 's guerrillas , wearing what became their trademark sandals , black pajama uniforms and red-checkered scarves , marched into Cambodia 's battered capital and declared the start of `` Year Zero , '' launching the most complete -- and brutal -- revolutionary transformations of a society ever attempted .
4700 5084 Taking a cue from China 's revolutionary leader Mao Zedong , Pol Pot put into practice an even more extreme brand of Maoism , emptying the cities and forcing millions of Cambodians into labor camps , abolishing all forms of money and currency , shutting down schools and temples , and establishing an insidious informants ' network in which even children were asked to spy on parents .
5085 5279 As part of his `` purification '' campaign , foreigners were expelled from Cambodia , and anyone suspected of being educated , middle-class or linked to the old regime was tortured and executed .
5280 5600 Cambodia 's current government -- led by Hun Sen , who was first installed in power by a Vietnamese invasion force in 1979 that ousted the Khmer Rouge -- has preserved evidence of Khmer Rouge atrocities at a schoolhouse called Tuol Sleng , whose classrooms had been converted into torture chambers under Pol Pot 's rule .
5601 5719 After Vietnam 's troops ousted Pol Pot , he led a guerrilla resistance movement , with arms and assistance from China .
5720 5897 Later , his guerrilla group 's clandestine radio station announced that Pol Pot had stepped down from active leadership of the Khmer Rouge , a claim that few outsiders believed .
5898 6032 To the end , Pol Pot remained unrepentant , insisting that although he may have made mistakes in power , `` My conscience is clear . ''
6033 6081 `` You can look at me , am I a savage person ? ''
6082 6157 he asked Thayer in an interview at the group 's jungle base in Anlong Veng .
6158 6267 `` Everything I have done and contributed is first for the nation and the people and the race of Cambodia . ''
