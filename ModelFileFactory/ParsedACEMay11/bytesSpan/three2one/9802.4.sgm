Mondale , leaves for Jakarta today to warn President Suharto against deviating from his pledge of economic reforms -- but also to admonish that Indonesia 's problems now go far deeper than economics .
426 781 The visit by Mondale , the former vice president and ambassador to Japan , comes as concern mounts among officials of the Clinton administration and the International Monetary Fund that Suharto is reverting to old-style favoritism toward cronies and relatives , flouting commitments he made to the IMF in exchange for a $ 43 billion international bailout .
782 1103 If the Indonesian leader is to lure back the capital that has fled his country , these officials argue , he must not only follow the IMF 's prescriptions , but take political steps to inspire confidence among investors that Indonesia is headed on a long-term reform path that will minimize the risk of a social explosion .
1104 1394 Officials were reluctant to specify what political measures Mondale might recommend , but Washington has urged the authoritarian Suharto for years to welcome a greater diversity of views in his government and rely less on the tight circle that benefits economically from the present system .
1395 1487 `` We want Indonesia to stabilize and grow again , '' a senior administration official said .
1488 1712 `` But we 're also quite convinced that in order to do it , they have to recommit , both in word and deed to the IMF program -- and to make sure that they are fostering a political situation that can sustain that program . ''
1713 1766 But Mondale will have a tough sell , officials admit .
1767 2055 Even if Suharto follows Washington 's advice , it is far from clear that Indonesia will recover anytime soon from a crisis that has sent inflation and joblessness soaring , sparking violence by resentful members of Indonesia 's Muslim majority against the wealthy ethnic Chinese minority .
2056 2220 The 76-year-old Suharto is deeply disillusioned by the failure of the IMF bailout to improve the economic outlook , according to officials who have spoken with him .
2221 2463 Following a visit last month by Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers and the IMF 's two top officials , Suharto signed an expanded list of promises to dismantle monopolies and end subsidies that favor his children and tycoon friends .
2464 2566 His reward from international investors : The nation 's currency , the rupiah , plunged to new depths .
2567 2659 U.S. and IMF officials contend that Suharto is to blame for undermining investor confidence .
2660 2739 Cartels that were supposed to be eliminated have been revived under new guises .
2740 2986 The independent-minded central bank governor was fired , and the government began considering establishing a `` currency board '' that would rigidly fix the value of the rupiah against the U.S. dollar -- a move Washington dismissed as unworkable .
2987 3185 Another problem is that many ethnic Chinese , who have funneled their money to Singapore and other havens , are reluctant to bring their wealth back to Indonesia because of the anti-Chinese rioting .
3186 3345 So long as the specter of violence continues to loom , their lack of confidence in Indonesia may persist , regardless of what reform measures Suharto embraces .
