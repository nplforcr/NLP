Wade Foes ` Still Going Strong ' ; Antiabortion Activists Will March to Mark 25th Anniversary of Decision BODY_LEN : 553 Susan Valentine , a 38-year-old mother of five from Annandale , does n't care whether 20,000 or 100,000 antiabortion demonstrators turn out for today 's `` March for Life , '' the protest held each year in Washington since the U.S. Supreme Court legalized abortion 25 years ago .
519 812 What matters , said Valentine , who has been active in the antiabortion movement since she was 13 , is that a quarter of a century after the court 's Roe v. Wade decision , `` we are still going strong , still drawing thousands of people to marches , still making this an issue for candidates .
813 885 After all this time , it shows the strength of people 's convictions . ''
886 1103 Organizers of the protest , which will begin with a noon rally at the Ellipse , followed by a march up Constitution Avenue to the Supreme Court building , declined yesterday to predict how many supporters will attend .
1104 1230 But they said the 25th anniversary will draw a larger turnout than the 50,000 to 75,000 who have participated in recent years .
1231 1462 Many older antiabortion activists from the Washington area have attended nearly every annual rally , and some said this year 's gathering is especially important , given the current heated debate over `` partial birth '' abortions .
1463 1507 `` I remember one year there was a blizzard .
1508 1586 Our church bus never came , so I waited for a Metro bus , and that never came .
1587 1714 Of course I 'll be there tomorrow , '' said Robert Follett , 62 , a longtime official with the Virginia Society for Human Life .
1715 1844 `` I will always feel that it is anathema to kill a child , whether it is an hour , a day , a week or months before the birth . ''
1845 2042 Thousands of parochial school and college students are joining this year 's demonstration , including 1,500 high school students from across the country who spent last night at Catholic University .
2043 2186 Some have described themselves as part of the `` Roe v. Wade generation '' -- lucky to be alive and eager to carry on the antiabortion crusade .
2187 2393 `` This generation has the plague of death hanging over it , '' said Christine O'Donnell , 28 , who heads a Christian youth group in Woodbridge that will hold a `` torch-passing '' ceremony after the rally .
2394 2478 `` We see teens killing each other over jackets , teens dumping babies in dumpsters .
2479 2596 Instead , we need to raise up a generation of young people who will carry the pro-life battle into the millennium . ''
2597 2704 Organizations that support abortion rights are commemorating the Roe anniversary in a more low-key fashion .
2705 2847 Their only public event was a gathering Tuesday outside the Supreme Court , where women who have had abortions talked about their experiences .
2848 2990 Today , Vice President Gore will be the main speaker at a hotel luncheon given by the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League .
2991 3144 Also , Resist and Refuse , a lesser-known abortion rights group , plans to hold a counter-demonstration to the antiabortion rally near the Ellipse today .
3145 3239 `` We have had lots of huge marches in our history , '' said Kate Michelman , NARAL president .
3240 3387 `` We use the anniversary of Roe to reflect on women 's lives and on the profound impact this decision has had on women from every walk of life . ''
3388 3523 In addition to today 's march , Roman Catholic churches and antiabortion groups scheduled a series of activities in the area this week .
3524 3711 Last night , Cardinal Bernard Law led a special Mass at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception , and youth groups held a `` Kids for Life '' music concert there .
