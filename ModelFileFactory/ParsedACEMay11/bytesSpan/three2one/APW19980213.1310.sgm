688 880 Prime Minister John Howard , a monarchist himself , promised to put the question to a national referendum next year after convention delegates voted 89-52 for a republic , with 11 abstentions .

1036 1122 `` The Australian people are owed the opportunity of expressing an opinion on this . ''
1123 1272 `` It would be a travesty in common sense terms of Australian democracy for that proposition not to be put to the Australian people , '' Howard said .
1273 1367 Even in his own Cabinet , Howard is becoming increasingly isolated with his monarchist stance .
1368 1505 Treasurer Peter Costello , Environment Minister Robert Hill and Attorney General Daryl Williams all voted to support the republic Friday .
