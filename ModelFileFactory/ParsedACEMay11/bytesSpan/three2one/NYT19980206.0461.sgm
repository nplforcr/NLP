FRIEDMAN dLR ; dQC ; dQL ; dUR ; c. 1998 N.Y. Times News Service dLR ; dQC ; dQL ; DAVOS , Switzerland _ Asia 's economic meltdown has spurred all sorts of would-be geo-architects to try to design some new , global mechanism that will regulate international capital flows and miraculously prevent global investors and speculators from ever again wreaking havoc .
636 806 I am deeply skeptical about such ideas _ not because I oppose tempering market excesses , but because I think that trying to do it on a global scale is nearly impossible .
807 863 Risk , fear , greed and excess are intrinsic to markets .
864 923 You can not legislate them out without paying a huge price .
924 1120 What 's interesting is that while Westerners are trying to redesign the market , the Thais , Koreans and Mexicans at this year 's Davos World Economic Forum were focused on redesigning themselves .
1121 1198 They think their solution is better local government , not global government .
1199 1355 Their countries were like 50-watt bulbs plugged into 250-watt sockets , and when the surge came from the electronic herd of global investors , they blew up .
1356 1476 Their reaction is to try to protect themselves with better governance , better regulation and more transparency at home .
1477 1607 Which is why both Thailand and Korea elected the most democratic parties in their countries at the depths of this economic crisis .
1608 1785 `` There are some voices saying that perhaps integration has gone too far and too quickly _ especially in financial markets , '' Mexico 's president , Ernesto Zedillo , told me .
1786 1834 `` Well , I happen to believe just the opposite .
1835 1907 Globalization poses challenges , but it offers tremendous opportunities .
1908 2079 The fact that finance capital can move instantaneously indeed poses a risk , but jumping from that to say that we need to control movements of capital is totally wrong . ''
2080 2205 Yes , added Zedillo , we need a strong IMF to help in emergencies and to detect distortions in countries or individual banks .
2206 2355 But at the end of the day , he said , `` all of these financial flows end up in a local financial system , or as resources to be lent by local banks .
2356 2501 What we have to look at is whether these -LRB- local -RRB- financial systems are sufficiently installing good banking and financial practices . ''
2502 2795 The Thai prime minister , Chuan Leekpai , told me : `` If you are going to be part of this global market you had better be able to defend yourself from this market ... One of the lessons this crisis has taught us is that many of our structures and institutions were not ready for this new era .
2796 2859 Now we have to adapt ourselves to meet international standards .
2860 2892 The whole of society expects it .
2893 2962 They are looking for better government and transparent government . ''
2963 3251 You Jong-keun , the chief economic policy adviser to South Korea 's newly elected president , said : `` In the past , the Korean government used its political muscle to emasculate the rights of shareholders , and business leaders were given power to make irresponsible business decisions .
3252 3388 We are going to strengthen the rights of shareholders and help make sure that business decisions are taken in an accountable fashion . ''
3389 3561 As Bob Hormats , vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International , put it : `` If your domestic institutions are strong , then you do n't need very strong global institutions .
3562 3672 If domestic institutions inside countries are weak , it wo n't matter how strong your global institutions are .
3673 3703 They will not be effective . ''
3704 3777 Democracy does not guarantee that you will never have an economic crisis .
3778 3791 We know that .
3792 3810 Markets overshoot .
3811 3838 Investors take crazy risks .
3839 4175 But the more democratic , accountable and open your governance , especially as an emerging market , the less likely it is that your financial system will be exposed to surprises , the easier it will be for you to improve and adapt when it is , and the more legitimacy your government will have to share the pain when change is required .
4176 4405 Of those Asian nations who were fully plugged into the market -LRB- China is not -RRB- , those with the most non-corrupt , transparent and accountable financial systems _ Taiwan , Hong Kong , Singapore _ have been hurt the least .
4406 4586 Those that had democratic , but corrupt , systems _ Thailand and Korea _ were hurt the second worst , but at least have been able to respond quickly by voting in better governance .
4587 4746 And the country that is going to melt down is Indonesia , which remains plugged into the electronic herd , but its corrupt , authoritarian regime ca n't adapt .
4747 4840 `` Look around the neighborhood , '' said the Thai finance minister , Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda .
4841 4891 `` Good governance is the only real protection . ''
