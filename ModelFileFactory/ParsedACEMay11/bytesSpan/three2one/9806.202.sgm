478 722 In electing Thomas R. Reardon , an Oregon general practitioner who had been the chairman of its board , members signified they did not hold him responsible for a costly gaffe last year , when the group agreed to endorse a line of Sunbeam Corp. .
723 744 health care products .
745 962 Reardon had become chairman just before the signing of the Sunbeam deal , which would have funneled millions of dollars to the AMA but violated its prohibition against letting its name be used for commercial purposes .
963 1301 Throughout the year and at the association 's annual meeting in Chicago this week , the episode heightened dissent within the organization , the largest-spending lobbying group in the country , which already has been weakened by a substantial decline in membership and the medical profession 's diminished clout in an era of managed care .
1302 1422 Reardon said yesterday that his election is evidence that physicians are eager to put last year 's troubles behind them .
1423 1637 In an interview , Reardon said he plans to focus on trying to persuade Congress to enact legislation to give doctors and patients more power against health maintenance organizations and other types of managed care .
1638 1943 He said the AMA also will emphasize a patient-safety initiative , an effort to teach doctors to provide better help to dying patients and their families , and an attempt to make sure the federal government does not punish doctors for simple billing mistakes in its efforts to crack down on Medicare fraud .
1944 2091 Reardon said he will work to rebuild AMA membership , which has slipped to the point that less than 40 percent of the nation 's doctors now belong .
2092 2303 But Raymond Scalettar , the Washington rheumatologist who announced that he would oppose Reardon just two weeks ago , said yesterday 's 270 to 196 vote reflects a reservoir of discontent within the organization .
2304 2506 `` It is clearly a message ... that the leadership of the American Medical Association has to be really on its toes for the future , '' said Scalettar , who was the AMA 's board chairman five years ago .
2507 2740 Scalettar 's candidacy marked the first time in 25 years that someone decided at the last minute to mount an insurgent challenge to what usually is a well-choreographed succession to the presidency of the 295,000-member organization .
2741 2837 Reardon now becomes the president-elect , and will begin a one-year term as president next year .
2838 2913 Yesterday , Nancy Dickey of Texas became the AMA 's first female president .
2914 3029 Many doctors at this week 's meetings said they think the organization needs to move beyond the recent controversy .
3030 3211 `` The physicians back home are n't interested in Sunbeam , '' said Robert Weierman , an orthopedic surgeon from South Orange , N.J. , who is one of the AMA 's 495 voting delegates .
3212 3308 `` Reimbursement problems and the slowdown in payments are the main issues where I come from . ''
3309 3454 But others said the Sunbeam matter will continue to haunt the association , particularly since the corporation has sued the AMA for $ 20 million .
3455 3556 `` The financial cost to the AMA is the least of it , '' one physician said at a forum on the matter .
3557 3668 `` The real cost is loss of prestige , the embarrassment we had , the realization our ship was not on course . '
3669 3669 .
