0 163 ed980122 .1130.0066 NEWS STORY A day where the investigation of the new allegations against President Clinton have taken some very interesting and startling turns .
164 285 Independent counsel Kenneth Starr 's office is interviewing other members of Monica Lewinsky 's White House intern class .
286 330 So far , two have been contacted by the FBI .
331 424 Agents apparently want to learn if Lewinsky ever discussed a relationship with the President .
425 538 The incident intruded into a White House photo opportunity today with Palestinian authority leader Yasser Arafat .
539 633 The President is sticking fast to denials he ever had any improper relationship with Lewinsky .
634 702 There are a lot of other questions that are I think very legitimate .
703 732 You have a right to ask them .
733 799 You and th - the American people have a right to - to get answers .
800 883 We are working very hard to comply , get all the requests for informations up here .
884 1059 ah And e - we will give you as many answers as we can , as soon as we can , at the appropriate time , consistent with our obligation to also cooperate with the investigations .
1060 1154 And that 's not a dodge , that 's really what I 've , what I 've I 've talked with our people .
1155 1173 I want to do that .
1174 1260 ah i - I 'd like for you to have more rather than less , s - sooner rather than later .
1261 1353 So we 'll work through it as quickly as we can and get all those questions out there to you .
1354 1463 Just moments ago , the President 's close friend and adviser and attorney Vernon Jordan spoke with the media .
1464 1648 Jordan told reporters he helped Lewinsky look for work in the private sector , arranging interviews for her with American Express , Revlon , and Young and Rubicam , a New York PR firm .
1649 1731 Jordan also said he helped Lewinsky obtain legal counsel after she was subpoenaed .
1732 1843 And he denied reports of an affair between the former White House intern and the President and of any cover up .
1844 2027 I want to say to you absolutely and unequivocally that Ms. melin - welinsk - Ms. Lewinsky told me in no uncertain terms that she did not have a sexual relationship with the President .
2028 2103 At no time did I ever say , suggest or intimate to her that she should lie .
2104 2327 On yet another front , CNN has learned the independent counsel Kenneth Starr planned to have the young woman wear a recording device in order to tape record conversations between her , and the President , and Vernon Jordan .
2328 2447 Starr apparently hoped to record Jordan first and then , based on that result , decide whether to record the President .
2448 2547 But CNN has learned the plan was abandoned when it became clear the investigation was going public .
2548 2663 Starr made a brief appearance before a frenzied crowd of reporters and photographers outside his Washington office .
2664 2695 He says the truth is out there .
2696 2775 Our job is to gather facts and to evaluate those facts and to get at the truth .
2776 2964 I have a very strong belief in facts and in truth , and that the facts will come out and the truth will come out , eventually , again consis - consistent with the presumption of innocence .
2965 3064 Let 's , let 's bear in mind that each individual in our country enjoys a presumption of innocence .
3065 3117 I think that 's very important in terms of fairness .
3118 3278 That 's why confidentiality , which is very hard to maintain now , but we 're doing our very best to maintain confidentiality because of individual reputations .
3279 3411 Monica Lewinsky talked about her alleged relationship with the President in many conversations recorded with coworker , Linda Tripp .
3412 3477 Some of them were purportedly taped by Tripp wearing an FBI wire .
3478 3511 All this set up by Kenneth Starr .
3512 3701 And Newsweek magazine reports Lewinsky said , and we quote , Maybe we should just tell the creep do n't ever talk to me again , now you have this information , do whatever you want with it .
3702 3775 And at the same time Lewinsky also declared , I have lied my entire life .
3776 3882 CNN confirms the President admits having an affair with Gennifer Flowers , while he was Arkansas governor .
3883 3992 Sources say the revelation came during his deposition last weekend in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case .
3993 4093 During the ninety-two campaign , the President flatly denied having an affair with Gennifer Flowers .
4094 4171 A majority of Americans believe the allegations against Mr. Clinton are true .
4172 4292 In a new CNN USA Today Gallup poll , fifty-four percent of those surveyed believe he had an affair with Monica Lewinsky .
4293 4380 Thirty-seven percent do n't believe it , forty-nine percent believe he lied under oath .
4381 4429 Forty-three percent say the allegation is false .
4430 4536 Fifty-one percent do not believe the President tried to obstruct justice , thirty-nine percent say he did .
4537 4657 A majority of Americans surveyed believes allegations Mr. Clinton had an affair while he was President are not relevant .
4658 4747 But most also believe allegations he lied under oath and obstructed justice are relevant .
4747 4747 .
