0 422 9801.35 NEWS STORY SOURCE : The Washington Post SECTION : A17 ; LENGTH : 518 DATE : January 29 , 1998 HEADLINE : Senate Confirms 3 Judicial Nominees as Backlog Fight Persists BODY_LEN : 488 The Senate yesterday confirmed three federal judges in its first official action of the year , slightly reducing the backlog of nominations that has drawn criticism from both President Clinton and Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist .
423 603 But the dispute over the Senate 's pace in dealing with nominations continued , with Republicans defending the record while Democrats charged the GOP with politicizing the process .
604 706 By a vote of 67 to 30 , the Senate confirmed Ann L. Aiken for a U.S. District Court vacancy in Oregon .
707 786 Her nomination had been held up for months by Sen. Mike Enzi -LRB- R-Wyo . -RRB-
787 881 , who accused her of leniency in sentencing a child molester when she was a state court judge .
882 1121 Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin G. Hatch -LRB- R-Utah -RRB- said that while Aiken would not have been his choice , she `` demonstrated to me that she understands the proper role of a federal judge in our constitutional system . ''
1122 1367 By voice vote , the Senate also confirmed Richard W. Story for the federal district court in Georgia and Barry G. Silverman of Arizona for the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals , which has jurisdiction over California and other western states .
1368 1480 Yesterday 's action reduces the list of judicial vacancies to 85 , or about 10 percent of the federal judiciary .
1481 1598 The Senate confirmed 17 judges in 1996 and 36 judges last year , drawing accusations of foot-dragging from Democrats .
1599 1689 Hatch and others said Clinton was mostly to blame because he was slow to make nominations .
1690 1776 More than 50 nominations are pending before the Senate , including 12 made on Tuesday .
1777 2073 The long-simmering dispute over the Senate 's performance on nominations came to a head when Rehnquist warned in a year-end report that the judicial vacancies were threatening the nation 's `` quality of justice '' and the White House pounced on his words to mount a campaign for speedier action .
2074 2197 With early decisions on Aiken , Story and Silverman , Senate Republicans tried to show they are not delaying confirmations .
2198 2495 If the White House intends to wage a battle over the nominations to portray the Republicans as anti-women and anti-minority , as newspapers have reported , then that is `` certainly a poor way to begin what I hope will turn out to be a cooperative effort to confirm federal judges , '' Hatch said .
2496 2825 Sen. Patrick J. Leahy -LRB- Vt. -RRB- , the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary panel , responded that Republicans are jeopardizing the `` independence and integrity '' of the judiciary by trying to hold up Clinton 's nominees and threatening other steps , including House threats of impeachment proceedings against liberal judges .
2826 2980 `` Partisan and narrow ideological efforts to impose political litmus tests on judicial nominees and to shut down the judiciary must stop , '' Leahy said .
2981 3068 In another contested nomination , Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott -LRB- R-Miss . -RRB-
3069 3146 said he intends to seek a vote next week on David Satcher as surgeon general .
3147 3351 Some Republicans have threatened to try to block the nomination because of Satcher 's support for administration policy opposing legislation to ban a procedure that some call `` partial-birth '' abortion .
