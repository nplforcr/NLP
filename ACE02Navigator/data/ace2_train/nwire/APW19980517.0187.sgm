BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) _ Leaders of the world's most powerful
nations ended their annual summit Sunday with an appeal to Pakistan
not to respond to India's nuclear explosions. But Pakistan said it
will set off its own nuclear blast.
In a final communique, eight presidents and prime ministers said
the challenge they face is to ensure that the benefits of open
trade and closer connections between nations worked to ``improve
the quality of life of people everywhere.''
But the heat of a South Asian nuclear arms race and chaos in
financially strapped Indonesia overshadowed the annual meeting.
The G-8 leaders condemned the Indian blasts and expressed
``grave concern'' in a special statement that they repeated in
their final communique. But because of reluctance by Russia,
Britain, France, Germany and Italy, they failed to endorse
sanctions, as urged by the United States, Japan and Canada.
British Prime Minister Tony Blair, at a closing news conference,
said the leaders' decision that ``individual countries will have
their own individual responses'' to India's nuclear tests was the
right thing to do.
U.S. President Bill Clinton, in interviews before the close,
said it was the strongest statement that could be obtained from the
leaders, which also included heads of Russia, Japan, Canada, Italy,
Germany and France.
Blair called upon Pakistan to resist entering the nuclear club
and upon India to join a global nuclear ban, saying its actions
``gravely weakened the security of the world.''
``It is important that they realize the huge international
concern that having done these tests now, particularly with what
we're hearing in terms of what Pakistan may do, it is essential
that they come within the comprehensive treaty process,'' Blair
said.
Pakistan called the Group of Eight effort a ``weak response''
and in Islamabad Sunday, Pakistan Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub told
The Associated Press, ``It is a matter of when, not if, Pakistan
will test ... The decision has already been taken by the Cabinet.''
While the communique was full of sweeping generalizations about
building a more prosperous world, the talk among the leaders was
about the more-immediate threats.
Clinton, in a broadcast interview, said India's nuclear
explosions risked drawing Pakistan, China and Russia into an
escalating conflict and both he and Blair, the host for this year's
gathering, appealed for restraint on the part of Pakistan.
``The answer is not for India to become a nuclear power, and
then for Pakistan to match it stride for stride, and then for China
to be brought in to support the Pakistanis and move troops to the
Indian border, and for Russia to come in and to recreate in a
different context the conflicts of the cold war,'' Clinton said.
``It is a nutty way to go. It is not the way to chart the future.''
In their final 10-page communique, released after a closing
session today, the leaders stressed that rich nations must work to
ensure that global prosperity is widely shared.
They pledged increased efforts to boost health care and
education programs in Third World countries and open their markets
further to imports from developing nations. The document stressed
the need to make sure the fruits of globalization were more widely
shared by all income groups in their own countries.
To that end, the leaders pledged greater efforts toward
``building lasting growth in our own economies in which all can
participate, creating jobs and combating social exclusion.''
The leaders held three days of discussions dominated by the
crisis in India and deadly anti-government riots in Indonesia.
Also set for the final day was a meeting between Clinton and
Russian President Boris Yeltsin, whose country joined the summit
for the first time as a full member.
On Indonesia, Clinton said in an interview broadcast by the BBC
that President Suharto, in power for 32 years, must find a way to
``deal with all elements of society on some sort of democratic
basis. ... This is not a hopeless situation yet.''
Blair, interviewed alongside Clinton, said the turmoil in
Indonesia underscored the need for greater financial stability to
promote global prosperity.
``What we can do is try and devise the right architecture for
the financial systems of the world which leads to greater
stability, more openness and more transparency,'' Blair said.
The G-8 leaders also urged voters in Northern Ireland and the
Irish Republic to approve a referendum Friday on a peace deal
providing for Catholic-Protestant power-sharing in the troubled
British province. In the BBC interview, Clinton predicted a victory
for the accord.
``All of us have hope and fear inside,'' said Clinton. ``I think
on election day, the clear-headedness of the Irish people will
prevail in Northern Ireland.''
While the G-8 leaders failed to agree on a proposal supported by
Blair to erase the debt of the world's poorest nations, the British
prime minister tried to put the best face on the disagreement,
insisting that the world's powers were united in the goal of
cutting debt, especially to the poorest African nations.
