	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Two Russians and a Frenchman left the Mir and
endured a rough landing on the snow-covered plains of Central Asia
on Thursday. But no one was hurt as the crew completed a successful
mission on the 12th anniversary of the space station's launch.
	   Cosmonauts Anatoly Solovyov and Pavel Vinogradov and French
astronaut Leopold Eyharts were briefly buffeted about in their
Soyuz space capsule when they touched down in the empty steppe of
central Kazakstan, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported, citing
Mission Control officials.
	   It took the crew three hours to descend from the Mir, 400
kilometers (250 miles) above Earth.
	   Space officials were worried beforehand about a blizzard that
raged through former Soviet republic on Wednesday evening and early
Thursday. They considered delaying the crew's return, but gave the
go-ahead when the weather improved.
	   ``Guys, don't you worry, the weather is getting better,''
Mission Control Chief Vladimir Solovyov told the crew.
	   Still, strong winds at the landing site dragged the tiny landing
capsule across the steppe as it touched down. Deep snow helped
cushion the impact, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   Immediately after the landing, the trio was put on a flight to
Moscow for routine medical checkups.
	   The two Russians arrived on the Mir last August when the
troubled space station was hobbled by a number of breakdowns,
including a reduced power supply.
	   But Solovyov and Vinogradov performed several successful repair
missions. The station is now back at close to full power and has
not had any major problems in recent months.
	   Solovyov, one of the most experienced space flyers ever,
celebrated his 50th birthday during his six-month space voyage. He
completed his fifth mission on the Mir and has now spent more than
20 months in space.
	   This was Vinogradov's first stint on the Mir, while Eyharts was
aboard for the past three weeks conducting scientific experiments.
	   The Mir was launched on Feb. 19, 1986, and was expected to
remain in operation for only five years. A series of near disasters
last year, including a fire, computer breakdowns, and a collision
with a cargo ship, raised doubts about the Mir's safety.
	   But Russian space officials want to keep the spacecraft manned
at least until next year, when an new international space station
is put aloft.
	   Russians Talgat Musabayev and Nikolai Budarin and American
Andrew Thomas remain aboard the Mir.
