	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Kidnappers seized four United Nations
military observers in the former Soviet republic of Georgia on
Thursday, but police quickly tracked down and surrounded the armed
gang.
	   The abductors demanded that the government free seven people
arrested for allegedly taking part in the last week's failed
attempt to kill President Eduard Shevardnadze.
	   Traveling in two cars, the kidnappers abducted the observers and
stole one of their vehicles in the western Georgia town of Zugdidi,
police said.
	   Several hours later, police encircled a house where the
kidnappers and the hostages were holed up in the village of
Dzhikhaskari, 20 kilometers (12 miles) away, Georgia's Interior
Minister Kakha Targamadze said.
	   Security officials placed armored military vehicles outside the
house and began negotiations with the kidnappers, the interior
minister added.
	   The kidnap victims included two observers from Uruguay, one from
Sweden and one from the Czech Republic, along with their Georgian
driver, according to the U.N. office.
	   The Uruguayans were identified as captains Ronald Garcia and
Julio Navas, and the Swede as Maj. Maaren Moelgaard. The identities
of the others were not immediately known.
	   The interior minister said the kidnappers were supporters of
former president Zviad Gamsakhurdia, who was ousted in 1992 and who
died under mysterious circumstances in 1994.
	   The kidnappers said they would free their hostages only if
authorities release all seven Gamsakhurdia supporters arrested in
recent days for alleged involvement in a Feb. 9 assassination
attempt against Shevardnadze.
	   Two of Shevardnadze's bodyguards were killed in last week's
attack, as was one of the assailants, but the president was
unharmed.
	   The U.N. observers are in Georgia to monitor the truce between
government forces and separatists in the northwest province of
Abkhazia. The separatists took control of the province in a 1992-3
war.
	   The U.N. team, along with Russian forces, have helped prevent
further outbreaks of fighting, but there has been no real progress
toward a political settlement.
