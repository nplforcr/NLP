King Hussein lashes out at opposition for anti-Israeli stand
</HEADLINE>

AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ King Hussein Sunday rebuked hard-line
political parties opposed to peace with Israel, saying they should
respect the majority opinion.
Hussein said he has always accepted the opposition's right to
differ. But at the same time ``the prevailing opinion should be
that of the majority, and the opinion of the majority should be
respected,'' the monarch said.
Hussein's remarks in a ceremony marking the 45th anniversary of
his accession to the throne underlined his frustration with
mounting opposition to Jordan's 1994 peace treaty with Israel.
With the Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations deadlocked, many
in Jordan's predominantly Palestinian population have became
critical of peace with Israel. But in the absence of opinion polls,
it is difficult to say how many Jordanians are for or against the
peace treaty.
``Opposition can be on a certain policy or position, but
absolute opposition for the sake of opposition is not acceptable,''
Hussein said. Instead, he said, there must be ``dialogue and
consultations until we reach a consensus.''
Jordan's 13 hard-line political parties, espousing ideologies
ranging from Muslim fundamentalism to communism, have no seats in
the 80-member parliament. Still, they wield considerable influence
among the poor Palestinian refugees in Jordan.
Palestinians displaced in the 1948 and 1967 Arab-Israeli wars
make up roughly two-thirds of Jordan's 3.8 million population.
