Prime minister says vote on constitutional reforms won't shake
government </HEADLINE>

MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi insisted
Tuesday that his government's stability doesn't depend on the fight
over constitutional reforms.
The squabble has grown so bitter that a vote on reforming the
presidency scheduled for Tuesday may be postponed to avoid
embarrassing the government.
The dispute centers on what power the president should have to
dissolve parliament.
Prodi had said he wants the reforms approved by a large majority
as a sign of wide support for constitutional change. But new
objections from the center-right opposition makes a big majority
unlikely, and there is now talk of scrapping the whole reform
process.
Luciano Violante, speaker of the lower house, has said he
believes throwing away a year and a half of work on reform would
prompt early elections.
But Prodi on Tuesday firmly rejected the idea that the stability
of his government is linked to the fight over reforms.
``I've always separated the issue of reform from the issue of
government,'' he told reporters after a meeting with Milan business
leaders. ``The are things that don't have points in common.''
