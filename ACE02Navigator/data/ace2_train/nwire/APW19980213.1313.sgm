PARIS (AP) _ Top seed Jana Novotna of the Czech Republic
recovered from a second set trouncing to advance to the semi-finals
of the Paris Open Friday, beating seventh-seed Barbara Paulus, of
Austria, 6-2, 1-6, 6-4.
``That was one tough match,'' Novotna, 29, said. ``I'm just
happy I came out a winner.''
Winner of the season-ending Chase Championships and currently
ranked third in the world, Novotna now meets Germany's Anke Huber,
seeded fifth, in Saturday's semi-finals.
The dlrs 480,000 Paris Open is Novotna's first tournament of the
year.
In other action, Belgium's Dominique Van Roost, seeded sixth,
beat the 1997 French Open champion Iva Majoli, of Slovakia, 7-5
6-3.
Both players were treated for injuries during play, Van Roost
suffering from stiffness in the forearm and Majoli with a
right-ankle strain.
``I played really good tennis today except at the start. I have
a flat-hitting game and I can take the risks I want to take when I
play indoors, '' Van Roost said.
The Belgian will now match up with the winner of the all-French
duel later Friday between Nathalie Tauziat, seeded fourth, and
Sarah Pitkowski.
