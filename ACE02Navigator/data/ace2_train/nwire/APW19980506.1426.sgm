HOTEL recruits, early in their careers, are taught to always
have a smile ready. These days, however, their employers - hotel
and resort operators - are finding it increasingly difficult to
stretch those facial muscles.
After many years of strong growth, local hoteliers are now
treading the downward trajectory of their cyclical industry, and
with rock bottom still far ahead, there's more reason to be glum
than smiling.
The root cause of the industry's troubles, ironically, stemmed
from optimism about the future. With one of the fastest growing
economies in the world, Malaysia seemed a sure bet for putting up a
hotel or resort.
After all, it had continuously attracted ever more business and
holiday travellers.
But even as new hotels were rapidly springing up, warning bells
were set off as early as 1995. New hotel rooms coming onstream in
most parts of Malaysia far outstripped the increase in tourist
arrivals, and occupancy levels and room rates in most states had
begun to fall by the end of 1996.
The stage was being set for a showdown in the hotel industry.
This was before the ugly, choking pall of smoke known as the
haze blanketed Southeast Asia and scared off several million
business and holiday tourists from the region. Thanks to the haze,
tourist arrivals in 1997 were almost 17% lower than the year
before, the first time in decades there had been a drop in the
number of arrivals to Malaysia.
Analysts tracking the hotel sector said occupancy levels in 1997
fell 5- 10% from 1996's figures, partly due to the bad publicity
Malaysia received during the year, and partly because there were
lots more rooms on the market. Hotels in the country, on average,
enjoyed occupancy levels of 62.5% in 1996, although city hotels
boasted a figure of 70-75%.
For 1988, an even more severe fall is predicted as more hotel
rooms come into service and competition heats up. Analysts said 13
five-star hotels with a total of 7,678 rooms and 24 three- and
four-star hotels with around 8,680 rooms are being built
nationwide. This would more than double the existing stock of
three, four- and five-star hotel rooms in Malaysia.
In Kuala Lumpur alone, some 13,161 hotel rooms were under
construction in 1997, with another 18,165 rooms in the pipeline
(though no doubt some projects have been dropped because of the
economic slowdown). For comparison, the city at the time had barely
17,000 rooms.
Selangor, meanwhile, is expected to have more than 10,000 hotel
rooms by the time the Commonwealth Games take place, about twice
the existing supply of 5,640 rooms. The Ministry of Finance's 1997
Property Market report says the situation is pretty much the same
in most of the other states.
`The signs were already there, this overbuilding. Even in 1995
the signs were there,' a puzzled Low Gee Tat, managing director of
Federal Hotels International, told Investors Digest.
`We were already feeling the pinch then. Although occupancy was
still OK, the rates stank. The sheer difficulty in operating just
eroded into our bottom line. It was difficult to get staff,
competition was intense - it was a very difficult situation to
operate in.
`Somehow, somewhere, the developers that went into the business
in recent years read the wrong signals or got the wrong advice or
whatever, because the signs were definitely there. There's really a
big glut in this country, a huge glut.' Federal Hotels
International (FHI) is the hotel arm of the Low Yat group, one of
Malaysia's largest property developers. They were the first to
build and operate an international class hotel in Malaysia - The
Federal Kuala Lumpur - in 1957.
Today, FHI has a chain of four- and five-star hotels, five of
which are run jointly with Inter-Continental Hotels &AMP; Resorts.
Inked on November 1996, the `strategic alliance' gave birth to
Federal Inter-Continental Hotels and Resorts Malaysia, of which Low
is the chairman. The hotels in FHI's line-up, besides The Federal,
are The Capitol Kuala Lumpur, Crown Princess Inter-Continental
Kuala Lumpur, Forum Fairlane Hotel Kuala Lumpur, the Ferringhi
Beach Hotel Penang, and the Marina Mirage Inter- Continental Penang
(opening soon). Overseas, FHI owns the Forum The Grace Hotel Sydney
and Rushcutters Bay Sydney (opening 1999), in Australia.
Low explained that with occupancy levels falling because rooms
outnumbered tourists, hoteliers came under pressure to lower room
rates.
But four- and five-star hotels in Malaysia were always among the
cheapest in the world, if not the cheapest, he said. `For the
service and quality you get, room rates have never been on the high
side.' Operating costs on the other hand were soaring. Trouble was
indeed brewing (see story on hotel stocks).
Then came the haze in the later half of 1977, which forced
hoteliers to drastically lower their already low rates just to fill
some rooms. As a result profit margins and yields were eroded
further, and the books of many hotel operators blushed scarlet.
`It was an undeclared price war,' Low admitted, `but that is an
ugly word. After that knock by the haze, a lot of hotels had to do
it out of necessity. They had to survive. They didn't do it to
increase market share or as strategy - it was like scraping the
barrel just to get some occupancy.' Things haven't improved much
this year. The first quarter has traditionally been slow for
city-based hotels, but this year `it's been slower than normal,'
noted Low. `The ideal situation for January to March in a decent
year is an occupancy rate of 70-75% with good (room) rates, but so
far this year the average occupancy has been between 50 and 55% and
room rates have also come down.' FHI had foreseen a few years ago
that the future would be tougher, and had implemented counteracting
strategies, he said. Nevertheless, FHI's bottomline has not escaped
unscathed.
`There's no way we can operate a hotel the way we did even five
years ago,' said Low. `We had to become more efficient, more
productive and more innovative. We've done that and we are still
doing that. We've had to change the cost structure and we are
changing the manning structure.
`From these basic infrastructural changes, we got into a
position to really look at our products and to know our market. If
we had to, we changed our products to suit the market.' Once the
products (hotel rooms and special packages) had been fine- tuned,
FHI focused on the domestic market and went all out to retain the
customers it had by making it `even more value-for-money for them,
to give them even more reason to stay with us.' At the same time,
FHI aggressively tried to tap new overseas markets, especially in
East Europe and the United States. Low said the group already had a
representative office in Europe which not only pushed FHI's hotels
but also promoted Malaysia as a holiday and business destination.
`There must be a reason for them to come here in the first
place,' he pointed out.
Some analysts predict it would take at least until the end of
1999 before visitor arrivals grow large enough to start pushing up
occupancy levels nationwide. The estimate, however, assumes that
the haze doesn't become an annual blight.
But behind every dark cloud is a silver lining. It seems ironic
that the economic downturn may provide some respite to the
industry. Some hotel projects are unlikely to be implemented now
and the weak Ringgit will also discourage travelling abroad, and
thus encourage domestic tourism.
Besides, the devaluation makes it cheaper for foreigners to
visit Malaysia.
Furthermore, Low said the current problems are pushing hotel
owners and operators into working together for the good of all.
`We've met and discussed some issues,' he said. `There are many
areas we can work together but at the moment I'm not at liberty to
reveal them. One obvious area, however, where we can cooperate is
by marketing the country together, to give foreigners a reason to
come and stay in our hotels.' On their part, the authorities could
promote in addition to the Commonwealth Games, other world-class
sporting and cultural events in Malaysia, he said. This would
generate global publicity and tempt some foreigners to visit.
But all these are ideas yet to be implemented. Who knows what
will happen in the future? For now, one thing is for sure. While it
may be difficult for hotel owners and operators to smile in these
tough times, frontline employees will be under strict orders to
flash those pearly whites at the few they serve.
