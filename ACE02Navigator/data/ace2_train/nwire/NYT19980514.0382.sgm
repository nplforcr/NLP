Back home last year on the Five Bar Ranch in Haskell, Okla., a
town without a traffic light, LeShon Johnson watched a television
special: Garth Brooks performing in Central Park.
``I saw all these people in the audience in cowboy hats and
cowboy clothes,'' Johnson, a recent Giants acquisition at running
back, said last week. ``I was surprised. I said to myself: `I
didn't know there were so many country people in New York City.'''
Told that the presence of cowboy clothes doesn't verify the
presence of country folk in New York, Johnson, a rodeo bull rider
until he was 19, smiled.
``Well, I brought my cowboy clothes to New York with me just the
same,'' he said. ``I get up in the morning sometimes, put them on _
my Wranglers, my Justin boots, my hat _ and just walk around. It
makes me feel like myself again.''
Two months ago, the Giants signed Johnson, 27, to a free-agent
contract, hoping to spice what has been a predictable running
attack with his explosive, breakaway speed. In Johnson, they also
added a player with an uncommon background.
``LeShon isn't some John Wayne act,'' said Giants coach Jim
Fassel, who coached Johnson when both were with the Arizona
Cardinals in 1996. ``He's a real cowboy.''
What else would you call the son of a longtime rodeo cowboy, a
football player whose experience with rawhide goes far beyond
pigskin? Johnson's childhood was split between life on a working
Oklahoma ranch and the rodeo tour where he would accompany his
father, Luther.
LeShon rode his first bull when he was 8, competed on the junior
rodeo circuit and in open rodeos _ as did his three brothers _ and
he plans to return to the rodeo when his football career is over.
``I'm going back as a steer wrestler,'' Johnson said.
Johnson is convinced he would have made it as a top-ranked bull
rider had football not interfered with his rodeo career. His father
talked him into giving up the bucking broncos for the bucks he
could theoretically make from the Broncos.
``The rodeo is a tough life,'' Luther Johnson said from the Five
Bar Ranch, where he now breeds horses. ``I gave my sons all of it
that they wanted, because I wanted them to see how hard it was. I
told them: `You don't see any cowboys driving a Mercedes.'
``I could have made LeShon a rodeo world champion, and he still
wouldn't have made as much as he made last year in football.
Besides, in the rodeo, if you get injured, your paycheck quits.''
And injuries are frequent.
``I got stepped on by a bull,'' said LeShon, who agreed to a
two-year deal with the Giants worth $350,000 this season including
his signing bonus. ``That joker almost crushed my thigh. My brother
got gored by a bull's horns inside his upper thigh. All we saw was
blood all over him. Everybody in rodeo has stories like that.
``But you know, I still miss it a lot. I'm going back some
day.''
LeShon does, however, acknowledge that his father's advice
proved to be sensible.
``He got me to stop at just the right time,'' said LeShon, who
rode his last bull in competition as a sophomore in college. The
following football season at Northern Illinois, Johnson led the
nation in rushing.
``I've seen too many kids dislocate their knees chasing a $400
jackpot,'' said Luther Johnson, who has spent 25 years as a rodeo
competitor, promoter or teacher. ``And being a black cowboy isn't
always easy either. I didn't always get a fair shot. It's better
for a black cowboy now, but it's a long ways from good.''

LeShon spent the last three pro football seasons with the
Arizona Cardinals. He led the team in rushing with 634 yards in
1996, gaining 214 in one game against New Orleans. But he was used
sparingly last season as the Cardinals committed to playing Leeland
McElroy, the team's second-round pick from 1996.
A free agent this winter, Johnson followed Fassel to the Giants.
He is also being reunited with Jim Skipper, the Giants' offensive
coordinator who once coached the Cardinals' running backs.
Johnson is known for an all-out running style. He is someone who
attacks the line of scrimmage with abandon.
``We used to say that when you gave LeShon the football,'' Kent
Graham, the former Arizona quarterback now with the Giants, said,
``one of two things could happen: He'd score a touchdown or get
absolutely hammered.''
In his 214-yard game two years ago, Johnson had touchdown runs
of 70 and 66 yards.
``I'm more refined now,'' he said last week. ``I'm learning from
my mistakes. I'm trying to make defenders miss me more often.''
But the rodeo rider, the guy who climbed atop 1,500 pounds of
bull _ held there only by a rope and a good grip _ still comes out
every now and then inside the football player.
``The bull doesn't care who you are,'' Johnson said. ``And
sometimes that's how I feel. I don't care if you're a 270-pound
tackle, before that game is over, I'm going to take a shot at
you.''
So far, Johnson has kept a low profile in his workouts at Giants
Stadium.
``Nobody knows anything about me,'' Johnson said.
He knows that will change. On every football team since college,
he's had the same nickname: Cowboy.
Last week, making his second lifetime visit to New York in the
span of a week, Johnson wore his cowboys duds into Manhattan.
``No one in my family other than Dad has ever been to New
York,'' he said, looking up at the cityscape as he walked in Times
Square. ``It's not much like home.''
Johnson, though, seemed to warm quickly to his new home. Within
a couple minutes, his Justin boots led him across Broadway against
the light.
But the man from Haskell, Okla., never seemed too very far from
the Five Bar Ranch _ 25 miles from Tulsa, and for LeShon Johnson
these days, a world away.
When someone mentioned that it was a cloudy day downtown,
Johnson said: ``The buildings are just too tall to let the sun
in.''
