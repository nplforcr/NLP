	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A powerful bomb blast Thursday damaged an
American car dealership in a possible protest to the U.S. military
confrontation with Iraq.
	   The pre-dawn explosion caused heavy damage to the showroom and
offices of a General Motors dealership about 12 kilometers (seven
miles) north of central Athens. There were no injuries.
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility.
	   But Greek media, quoting police sources, said there was
speculation the attack was a protest of possible U.S. military
strikes against Iraq. The United States is damanding Saddam Hussein
give full access to U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   Government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said it was ``premature''
to connect the attack with the U.S. military build-up in the
Persian Gulf.
	   U.S. Ambassador Nicholas Burns, who met with Greek police
officials in a pre-scheduled courtesy visit, told reporters that
U.S. authorities had no direct information on reports that the
blast was linked to the standoff with Iraq.
	   There have been a series of bombings around Athens in recent
months. On Feb. 3, two bombs exploded outside McDonald's
restaurants, causing damage but no injuries.
