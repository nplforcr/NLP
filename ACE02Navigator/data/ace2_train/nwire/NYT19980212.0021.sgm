NEW YORK _ Chances for the fastest mile in Madison Square
Garden's history improved markedly Wednesday when Laban Rotich of
Kenya arrived in New York and was immediately switched from the
Millrose Games' 800 meters to the Wanamaker Mile.
Rotich is a tiny (5 feet 4 inches, 99 pounds) 28-year-old who
did not start running seriously until three years ago and had not
competed indoors until this month.
He is a quick learner. In his first indoor race, at Stuttgart,
Germany, on Feb. 1, he went 1,500 meters in 3 minutes 32.11
seconds, which is equivalent to a 3:49 mile and is the
third-fastest indoor 1,500 ever.
That was on a 200-meter track with wide, sweeping turns. Friday
night, he will have to contend with the tighter turns and shorter
straightaways of Madison Square Garden's 160-yards-per-lap oval. He
is happy to have been switched from the 800.
``From 800 to the mile was very nice for me,'' Rotich said
Wednesday. ``Because I am very small it takes a lot more energy for
me to run with those big white men in the 800. In the mile I can
run in front and run fast.''
Although he is not sure how he will be able to handle the Garden
track, Rotich thinks he can run ``about 3:53 or 3:52.'' The
Millrose record is 3:53, set by Eamonn Coghlan in 1981.
The runner Rotich swapped places with is another Kenyan, William
Tanui. Tanui, the 1992 Olympic 800-meter gold medalist, has been
running the mile for the last three years.
``I'm a little slower than I was in 1992,'' Tanui said. ``But I
can still run 1:44 for 800 meters.''
Tanui thinks Rotich's small size will help him on the Garden
track, but he is not sure how much the tighter turns will slow him
down. ``But I think he will run 3:54, and maybe faster.''
Rotich and Tanui are here with a third Kenyan, Robert Kibet, who
is expected to set a fast pace for Rotich's mile effort. The three
showed they are race-ready in a brief workout Wednesday at the
Chelsea Piers track. After a 10,000-meter warm-up running easy 6:40
miles, they ripped off a 55-second 400 meters followed by 200-meter
blasts in 24.5, 26 and 25.5 seconds with less than two minutes
rest.
A fast pace may or may not lead to a new Garden record, but is
almost certain to help Marcus O'Sullivan. O'Sullivan, a five-time
Wanamaker Mile winner, will be trying to run his 100th
sub-four-minute mile.
