BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's Chatchai Sasakul retained
his World Boxing Council flyweight title Friday, winning by
unanimous decision of the judges over South Korea's Kim Yong-jin.
Chatchai, 28, entered the bout held on the southern Thai resort
island of Koh Samui with a professional record of 31 wins,
including 23 knockouts, and one loss.
Ninth-ranked challenger Kim, also 28, had a record of 20 wins,
with 13 knockouts, against two losses and one draw, before Friday's
fight.
Although Chatchai had been heavily favored, Kim put up a
credible fight, but did not connect with enough punches to
seriously threaten the Thai champion.
One judge scored the fight 117-111, while the other two both
scored it 119-111 in the Thai's favor.
