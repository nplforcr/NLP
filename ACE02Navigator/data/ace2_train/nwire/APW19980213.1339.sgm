BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Franco Squillari defeated Miguel
Tobon 6-2, 6-1, 6-1 on Friday as Argentina took a 2-0 lead over
Colombia in the first day of Davis Cup competition.
In the opening match, Lucas Arnold easily beat Mario Rincon 6-0,
6-2, 6-2 in Group One of the American Zone. Arnold, Argentina's
third-ranking player, needed little more than 1 and 1/2 hours to
finish off Colombia's top player.
The competition continues through Sunday at the Mayling Club de
Campo, 40 miles (60 kms) north of Buenos Aires.
Lucas Arnold and Luris Lobo, both of Argentina, will face Miguel
Tobon and Philippe Moggio in doubles play on Saturday.
If victorious, Argentina will play Chile _ whose team includes
recent Australian Open finalist, Marcelo Rios _ in April.
