SEVILLE, Spain (AP) _ A British man was among five people killed
in a car crash on the main road connecting the southern Spanish
cities of Seville and Malaga, police said Friday.
Police identified the dead Britain only by the initials R.D.F.P,
but news reports said his full name was Roy Dermott Fitzpatrick,
originally from Ashby-de-la-Zouch in Leicestershire and a resident
of the Balearic Islands off the eastern Spanish mainland.
Police said the 31-year-old Britain died late Thursday along
with three Spaniards, two women and one man, when their Ford Escort
was collided into by an Opel Astra driven by a Spanish male who
also died.
The authorities have yet to determine whether the five victims
died instantaneously in the crash or in the flames that enveloped
the two vehicles shortly afterwards, police said.
