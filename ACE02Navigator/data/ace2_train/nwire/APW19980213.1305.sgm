JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel will ask the United States to delay a
military strike against Iraq until the Jewish state is fully
prepared for a possible Iraqi attack with non-conventional weapons,
the defense minister said in remarks published Friday.
Also Friday, the United States announced that it sent a team
from the Center for Disease Control to assist the Palestinian
Authority in assessing its ability to protect its population in the
event of a biological or chemical weapon attack by Iraq.
The U.S. ambassador to Israel, Edward Walker, assured Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai in a meeting that Israel would have
enough time to properly prepare.
Israel is equipping its residents with gas masks and preparing
kits with antidotes.
Gabi Ofir, the commander of Israel's distribution centers told
Israel Radio that 300,000 gas mask kits have been dispensed to the
public in the last several weeks.
Israel has been scrambling to buy more masks abroad. after a
shortage of several hundred thousand gas masks, including those for
young children, was discovered.
Germany has agreed to lend Israel 180,000 protective kits
against chemical and biological weapons, and Switzerland offered to
lend Israel another 25,000 masks.
In Stockholm, the Swedish government announced it has authorized
the sale of up to 80,000 gas masks for children.
Government spokesman Moshe Fogel said Israel appreciated the
Swiss offer, but would have to determine the masks' compatibility
to Israel's needs before accepting.
Meanwhile, an Israeli delegation traveled Friday to Oslo to
examine 200,000 gas masks the Norwegian government has offered,
Israel radio said.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the prime minister of
the Netherlands to thank him for thousands of gas masks his country
has already contributed.
The Defense Ministry said 16 planes have landed so far with
protective equipment against biological and chemical warfare.
Mordechai said all the gas masks from abroad would arrive soon and
be distributed to the public, adding that additional distribution
centers would be set up next week.
``There is no reason why we would not be prepared,'' Mordechai
told the Yediot Ahronot daily. ``If, in spite of everything, we
will not be ready, we will ask the United States to delay the
operation.''
``There is no certainty that they will do what we ask, but they
will definitely take into consideration our readiness,'' he added.
Israel's armed forces chief, Lt. Gen. Amnon Lipkin-Shahak,
appeared on national television Friday night in attempt to reassure
a jittery public.
``When events are concrete and actually unfolding, we will
include the entire population in the measures we decide are
appropriate to take,'' Shahak said in an interview with Channel Two
Television.
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said earlier this week
that Baghdad has no intention of attacking Israel even if Iraq is
targeted by the United States.
But Netanyahu said Thursday that he would not rely on Iraqi
promises when it came to Israel's security.
The United States has promised to defend Israel, and the daily
Maariv said Friday that the Americans had agreed to send Israel
special equipment for detecting chemical or biological weapons.
Israeli troops will go to the United States next week to train
with the equipment, Maariv added.
Several pro-Iraq demonstrations have taken place in the last
week in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank despite the Palestinian
Authority's public opposition to them.
A spokesman for the Arab Liberation Front, a Palestinian group
that has been organizing pro-Iraq demonstrations, claimed their
leader was arrested Friday by the Palestinian police in the Gaza
Strip.
