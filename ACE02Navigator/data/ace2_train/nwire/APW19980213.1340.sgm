MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Italian defender Christian Panucci ruled
out reports Friday that he planned to leave Real Madrid and rejoin
Fabio Capello's AC Milan, saying he intended to finish his
six-season contract with the Spanish club.
``I wouldn't go to Milan for a billion,'' Panucci, sitting
alongside Madrid chairman Lorenzo Sanz, told a press conference.
``I am very happy here.''
A former Milan star, Panucci signed for Real Madrid half-way
through last season while Capello was coach of the Spanish side and
led it to win the league championship. He is under contract until
2003.
Sanz said that anyone who wanted to buy Panucci before that
would have to pay the 15 billion pesetas (dlrs 100 million)
stipulated.
Talk that Panucci might follow Capello back home increased in
recent weeks with poor performances leading him to be frequently
placed on the substitutes' bench by current Madrid coach Juup
Heynckes.
