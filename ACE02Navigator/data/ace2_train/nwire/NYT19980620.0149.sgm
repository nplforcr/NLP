MOSCOW _ The warmth and lingering daylight of a Moscow summer
could make even the harshest periods of Soviet rule seem less
demented. The appearance of flowers and fresh fruits and vegetables
in barren markets temporarily lifted the city's spirits, creating
the illusion that this was just another European capital marking
time until the August holidays.
Now it is no longer an illusion. Moscow may not be Paris or
Rome, but it is no longer a world apart. The differences of dress,
demeanor and politics that made Moscow so distinctively depressing
have melted away. From its monumental traffic jams to its
supermarkets, boutiques and elegant restaurants, Moscow is a big,
bustling, brash metropolis exploding with energy and
entrepreneurial activity.
To see the city again after an absence of three years, and to
compare it to the Soviet citadel of 10 years ago where I worked as
a correspondent, is to appreciate anew how far Russia has traveled
since the demise of Communism. The economy is shaky, corruption is
ubiquitous and the power of the wealthiest bankers and businessmen
remains largely unchecked, but these and other deformities should
not overshadow the political and economic changes that have
transformed Russia in just a few years. Almost as swiftly as the
1917 Bolshevik Revolution sealed Russia in hermetic isolation, the
arrival of democracy and capitalism have set it free and tied it to
the West, culturally and economically.
Moscow is the epicenter of change, and the locus of wealth, in
the new Russia. It will be some time before the rest of the
country, including St. Petersburg, comes anywhere close to matching
the standard of living now enjoyed by many Muscovites.
One of the best seats for observing the new Russia is on the
terrace outside the cavernous McDonald's at Pushkin Square. Though
the novelty of Big Macs has faded, the restaurant still has cachet
with Russians and serves as a mecca for affluent young Muscovites.
They arrive in Jeep Cherokees and Toyota Land Cruisers, cell phones
in hand. The men are dressed nattily in light-weight pleated
trousers, colorful sport shirts and tasseled loafers, the women in
short skirts, tight tops and stylish Italian shoes. The scene seems
almost unimaginable to someone who lived here a decade ago.
The McDonald's also attracts working-class customers who have
become indistinguishable in appearance from their counterparts in
London or New York. The nondescript Soviet wardrobe has almost
entirely vanished, replaced by jeans, colorful outfits and Nike or
Reebok shoes. Even eyeglasses and sunglasses are sleek. After
decades of enforced conformity in everything from clothing to
politics, Russians have seized the chance to assert their
individuality.
Across from the McDonald's is a small plaza that is part of the
boulevard that circles central Moscow. Once a cheerless place with
a few scruffy benches and an expanse of dirt, it is now the site of
a leafy beer garden where people congregate after work, engaging in
easy conversation as the daylight stretches far into the evening.
The talk is of business and politics, romance and vacation plans.
The fear that once permeated Moscow and made it so inhospitable to
such gatherings is gone.
The press is full of lively debate and invective, the television
news a cascade of irreverent reports. Even more remarkable is the
Internet, where information of all kinds is available about the
government and the economy. Where implacable customs agents once
enforced Soviet censorship at Sheremetyevo airport, there is now an
unobstructed ``green channel'' for passengers with nothing to
declare.
The new Russia is an unfinished work. It is a land that favors
the young and those unbroken by Communism and has little patience
or compassion for those unable to adapt. But Moscow, at least, is
increasingly a city where people can enjoy life. Considering its
history, that is no mean feat.
