NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) _ Britain and some of its Caribbean
colonies clashed over London's insistence that the islands abolish
the death penalty as a step towards closer relations, delegates to
a Caribbean forum said Friday.
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, who attended the United
Kingdom-Caribbean Forum in Nassau, has urged the colonies to join
the Labor government in abolishing the death penalty.
Cook made the appeal in a Feb. 4 speech in which he said Britain
was considering granting full citizenship to its colonies.
Toward closer ties, the colonies also are getting their own
minister, a forum for annual top-level consultations, and a new
name _ ``overseas territories'' _ reflecting they are
self-governing rather than dependent.
``They are saying we must eliminate the death penalty. But we
had a referendum and people voted for it to remain,'' Bermuda
Premier Pamela Gordon said Friday.
Other delegates said the former British colonies of Belize and
Trinidad and Tobago were upset that the death penalty issue was
included in a working session on human rights on Thursday. British
officials had no immediate comment on the discussions.
Some Caribbean countries beset by an increasing number of
drug-related murders have tried to use the death penalty. But they
have been obstructed by the Privy Council in London, the highest
appeals court for several former and current British colonies.
In 1993, the Privy Council ruled it was inhumane to execute
prisoners who had waited on death row for more than five years. It
recommended that inmates who exceed that period have their
sentences commuted to life in prison.
The ruling effectively ended hangings in many Caribbean
countries, where appeals cases sometimes drag on for a decade.
Delegates from some former colonies have suggested they will act
on longstanding plans to create their own supreme court and cut
their ties to the Privy Council.
``Human rights mean different things to different countries, and
for us in the Caribbean we have made it clear we don't want anybody
lecturing us about human rights,'' said Guyanese Foreign Minister
Clement Rohee.
