U.N. weapons inspectors have found evidence that Russia held
discussions with Iraq about selling Baghdad equipment that could be
used to develop biological weapons, an official familiar with Iraqi
weapons programs said.
But the official cautioned that it was not clear that any
equipment had actually been delivered.
``There are indications of contacts between the various
people,'' the official said. ``Whether the contacts resulted in
anything I don't know. But this clearly merits further
investigation.''
The Washington Post reported Thursday that U.N. weapons
inspectors discovered a confidential July 1995 Iraqi government
document that detailed long-running negotiations between Iraqi and
Russian officials regarding the purchase of a 1,300 gallon
fermentation vessel. The fermentation unit could be used either to
make protein for animal feed or biological weapons.
The team reported that ``fermentation, production, aerosol
testing and storage existed at that site,'' but that it found ``no
evidence of biological weapons per se'' and ``no facility for
filling weapons.'' Even so, inspectors said a great deal of
equipment had evidently been removed before their arrival.
Wednesday the Iraqi government offered to open for a limited
time a small number of sites it has closed to U.N. arms inspectors,
but the United States and Britain held to their insistence that
Baghdad cooperate fully with the inspections or risk a military
strike.
The Russian negotiations took place around 1995, the Post said.
Earlier weapons inspectors had said that Iraq had purchased a large
amount of materials with potential biological weapons uses,
suggesting that the Russians had to have been aware of Iraqi
intentions, according to this account. Iraq used a variety of
fermentation vessels to develop biological weapons before the war
in the Persian Gulf in 1991.
In a 1996 report on biological weapons, the Center for Strategic
and International Studies, a public policy research institution in
Washington, warned that it was easy for would-be terrorists to
assemble biological weapons _ using commercial equipment with a
capacity of 130 gallons.
In 1991, when Iraq accepted the Security Council's terms for a
cease-fire in the Persian Gulf War, it maintained that it had no
biological weapons program. But U.N. inspectors later said that
they had found ``a capability to research, produce, test and store
biological warfare agents'' at Salman Pak, southeast of Baghdad.
The team reported that ``fermentation, production, aerosol
testing and storage existed at that site,'' but that it found ``no
evidence of biological weapons per se'' and ``no facility for
filling weapons.'' Even so, inspectors said that a great deal of
equipment had evidently been removed before their arrival.
The Iraqi government offered to open for a limited time a small
number of sites it has closed to U.N. arms inspectors, but the
United States and Britain held to their insistence that Baghdad
cooperate fully with the inspections or risk a military strike.
In an offer that fell far short of the British and American
demands, Iraq's deputy prime minister, Tariq Aziz, proposed opening
eight closed ``presidential'' sites in Iraq to international
inspection for 60 days. He did not disclose their exact locations.

Aziz further stipulated that the inspectors report not to the
U.N. Special Commission charged with searching Iraq for weapons of
mass destruction, but directly to Secretary General Kofi Annan and
other diplomats and Security Council experts.
Aziz, in an interview with CNN, acknowledged Iraq's antagonism
toward the commission, called by its acronym UNSCOM, whose
inspectors have destroyed more Iraqi weapons in the past seven
years than were demolished during the 1991 Gulf War. ``UNSCOM is
the adversary,'' he said. ``It is not the judge.''
In Washington, President Clinton repeated that Saddam Hussein
would not be allowed to set the conditions for inspections. ``If he
will not act, we must be prepared to do so,'' he said.
