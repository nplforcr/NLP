NEW YORK _ The pink Cristal Champagne was flown in from France,
and the rack of lamb was made to order by the chefs at Mortimer's.
All so Ilyse Wilpon, whose family is an owner of the Mets, could
entertain 113 friends at a private dinner recently.
Inside the Upper East Side restaurant, which on this evening was
closed to the public, men in Turnbull &AMP; Asser shirts and the latest
Hermes ties sat alternately around 12 tables with women with
blown-out bobs and Chanel suits.
The sexes were evenly balanced _ man, woman, man, woman _ except
for a 13th table, at which seven women sat together with a single
man (who seemed to disappear after he ate the lamb).
Ms. Wilpon, 35, who co-owns and manages Tati North America, a
French bridal store on Fifth Avenue, was concerned about the
table's imbalance. ``Seating can get so complicated,'' she sighed,
standing by the bar, wearing black and white pearls and a strapless
Givenchy dress. At the last minute, seven of her guests had
canceled, all of them men. They blamed late planes and sudden
business meetings (sure, sure). Ms. Wilpon seated the extra women
with her 92-year-old grandmother. But no one seemed overjoyed about
the arrangement.
From Park Avenue to Park Slope, an age-old imbalance confronts
the givers of dinner parties: men seem so much more reluctant than
women to dress nicely and converse politely around a table. All
over town, men and women who attend dinner parties _ whether
intimate ones in private homes, black-tie charity affairs in hotel
ballrooms or, the latest trend, parties in hot restaurants _ agree
that the male of the species is difficult to lure out of his lair
for an evening.
Lauran Walk, 27, a production coordinator for Sony studios, said
it was nearly impossible to get her husband, Charlie Walk, a music
promotion executive, to accompany her to dinner parties given by
her friends. ``He always gives me a hard time,'' Ms. Walk said.
``He says he's really tired or he wants a quiet night.''
Scott Jones, 30, a tax manager who lives in the East 20s, says
he zones out at dinner parties. When his girlfriend, Sherri Weiss,
asks him to go with her, he says, ``I suddenly remember a buddy who
is in some serious need of guidance.''
The reluctance challenges dinner-party hosts, who almost
invariably say that whether their guests are married or single, gay
or straight, dinner parties ought to have equal representation by
the sexes. ``My friends and I say you should go downstairs, dress
up the doorman and bring him up to the table rather than be short a
man,'' said Jackie Weld, a writer living on the Upper East Side,
who gives dinner parties twice a month.
Polly Onet, a professional party planner who has organized
events from small birthday parties to the society wedding of David
and Julia Koch, said: ``Women don't want to get all dressed up and
sit next to other women. And women love to go out more than men.''
Why, oh why is this the case in the capital of the universe in
1998, when such differences between the sexes might seem to have
gone the way of formal dance cards and white tie and cutaways?
Men and women who are experienced both as reluctant guests and
imploring hosts offer a variety of reasons. ``Women are more
adventurous than men,'' admitted Soli Mehta, 36, an investment
banker, adding that he'd rather go to the same familiar restaurants
in jeans than dress up and sit next to someone he doesn't know at a
dinner party. ``It's about being comfortable after work,'' he said.
Women, in his experience, ``like to try new things, dress up, go to
new places.''
Letitia Baldrige, the etiquette maven, said the difference
traces to the time when women were denied access to the working
world, with its opportunity for social and intellectual
stimulation. ``Women have fought for years to be part of important
dinner conversation,'' she said. ``It's their only time for social
intercourse with the opposite sex. Lunch is for ladies. Dinner is
for both. Women, many times, have been with the children all day,
or even if they haven't, they may be bored with their own husbands
and want another husband to talk to. Who knows, they may even end
up marrying the other one.''
Today, of course, most women work, and many have opportunities
for social interaction during the day. But even professional women
seem to enjoy the dinner-party ritual more than their male
counterparts.
``I like getting dressed up,'' said Ellen V. Futter, the
president of the American Museum of Natural History, who said it
doesn't matter whether the event is an extension of work or her
social life. Her husband, she said, is much harder to coax out of
the house.

Ann Stock, the vice president of institutional affairs at the
Kennedy Center in Washington and a former White House social
secretary, said, ``I would go to anything that seems even remotely
interesting.'' But her husband, Stuart Stock, a lawyer, barely
wants to go out at all. ``We have so much discussion before he ever
gets anywhere,'' she said. ``He whines. He says it's a school
night. And if it's a seated dinner, he's dead, because he can't
control the time at which you leave.''
She sometimes resorts to calling her husband's secretary and
having her secretly pencil in a date on his calendar. ``He says,
`How did that get there; I don't remember this one,' '' she said.
Many men speak of the dread of being ``stuck'' at a dinner
party, seated between guests they do not know and may never see
again, and if it's a weekday, they are anxious about getting to bed
early enough to face another day at the office.
``There's a sort of gloom that settles over the room when it's
9:30 p.m. and the food hasn't been served and the speeches haven't
started and you know you won't be home before midnight,'' said
James B. Meigs, the editor in chief of Premiere magazine, a family
man who reluctantly attends charity benefits and work-related
dinner parties in midweek.
To be sure, there are working women who feel the same way. Debra
Cohen, a 35-year-old criminal defense lawyer in Manhattan who was
attending Ms. Wilpon's dinner, said, ``My time is limited, so I
pick carefully which parties to go to.''
But on the whole, the testimony of dinner-party hosts clearly
points to an inequity between the sexes on this issue _ one that
seems to have heretofore escaped the scrutiny of sociologists,
psychologists and women's studies departments.
Inveterate partygivers, including the professionals who plan the
charity galas that are a mainstay of Manhattan social life, have an
arsenal of tricks for luring male guests. They conspire with
caterers to plan menus suited to men's tastes _ entrees like leg of
lamb and chocolate desserts _ and then list the courses on menu
cards in the hope of enticing men to sit through the meal rather
than bolt early.
If men see fish or lemon chiffon on the menu, ``they might
escape at any time,'' Christopher Robbins, a caterer, said.
``Instead we have something like a dense chocolate truffle cake,
ending with a great rare port. They will know it's something to
hang for. It's all about keeping them in the apartment.''
Another potent lure is the promise of a new business contact.
Even Walk, reluctant to attend parties given by his wife's friends,
says he is happy to make exceptions for dinners involving contacts
in his industry, music and entertainment. ``When you allocate your
precious time you want to take something away with you,'' Walk, 30,
said.
George Trescher, an organizer of many high-profile public
parties, said that a magazine celebrating a big anniversary
recently wanted to carry this principle to an extreme: it proposed
seating all the powerful men together and ``letting the ladies fall
where they will.'' Trescher refused, and the seating was
conventional. ``It's only the lower class in other countries where
the men and the women do not sit together,'' he said.
What is wrong, one might ask, with unbalanced tables at this
late date in the 20th century, when almost every other social
convention has been undermined?
Yet, even as modern a man as Michael Caruso, the editor in chief
of Details magazine, who gives dinner parties once every two or
three weeks for 10 to 16 guests, insists on balancing the tables.
He cites the same reason as many hosts: the mild sexual tension
that ensues, even among happily married couples.
``When there's a sexual element, that's always fun,'' Caruso,
36, said. ``Anytime there's good food, alcohol and sex, it makes a
good time.''
He invariably holds his soirees in hip restaurants like Lot 61,
Indochine and Casa La Femme; the dinner-party-in-a-restaurant seems
to be the latest trend. ``Dinner parties are definitely the thing
right now,'' he said. ``It goes along with this nouveau
sophistication. It's what your parents used to do.''
Sydney Biddle Barrows, the famed Mayflower Madam who has written
a book, ``Just Between Us Girls: Secrets About Men From the Madam
Who Knows'' (St. Martin's Press, 1996), said that her husband,
Darnay Hoffman, a lawyer, hates to go out and so she frequently
goes alone.
``I was single for 42 years,'' she said. ``I never needed a man
to go anywhere. I think the women who are not going out by
themselves are cheating themselves. I don't understand it.''
Mindful, however, that some party hosts look askance at women
who arrive dateless and further imbalance the tables, Ms. Barrows
sometimes invites a gay male friend. So does Ms. Onet. So do so
many women on the Upper East Side that the institution of the
habitually available extra man has a name: the walker.
Walkers _ the term is considered derogatory by many, though it
is widely used _ are single men, often but not exclusively gay, who
enjoy going out night after night and who have the wardrobe and
social graces to match. A walker is not expected to pay for
transportation, drinks or gala tickets (that is the function of the
woman who invited him), but he must make witty conversation, look
swell and escort his date to her door (and no farther).
The socialite Nan Kempner is well known for bringing escorts
other than her husband, the Wall Street investor Thomas Kempner,
who prefers to be in bed most nights by 11.
``My Tommy doesn't particularly like going out,'' she said. So
Ms. Kempner, who does _ often five nights a week _ arranges for
escorts like Kenneth Jay Lane, the jewelry designer. Lane, who said
he goes to dinner parties ``370 days out of 365 days in the year,''
said that sometimes the invitations arrive just hours before the
event. ``You know, when husbands get sick and the hostess says,
`I'm desperate, I need a man,' '' he said. Lane said his cachet
lies in the fact that he can ``talk to a stone.'' When he asks
hostesses if he can bring a guest of his own, ``they groan,'' he
said.
``We're necessary,'' Lane said of the institution of the walker,
a term first applied in the 1970s to Jerome Zipkin, a frequent
escort of Nancy Reagan. ``I don't think ladies want to dress up and
only see ladies. And husbands, they don't always like to go out.''
At Ms. Wilpon's party at Mortimer's, Joel Leff, the chairman of
Forstmann-Leff Associates, an investment management firm, said he
gets 15 dinner-party invitations a week _ in large part, he
admitted, because he is single and wealthy. He accepts many of
them, but there are limits to his fortitude. ``Let me tell you
about the usefulness of my dogs at a dinner party,'' he said,
explaining how he extricates himself from parties with the excuse
that he must walk his two King Charles spaniels, Edison and
Smudgin.
Just as the chocolate mousse was served, Leff jumped to his
feet. ``My dogs, my dogs,'' he said. He walked toward the door,
leaving behind five impeccably dressed women, and no men, at his
table.
