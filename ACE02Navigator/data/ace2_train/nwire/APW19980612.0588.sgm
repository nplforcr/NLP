SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Ending months of
uncertainty, the Muslim chairman of Bosnia's joint presidency
announced Friday that he would campaign again for president.
By doing so, Alija Izetbegovic, 73, missed his chance to become
the first leader from former Yugoslavia to give up his presidential
position. In all five republics that became countries, national
leaders who took over the posts between 1989 and 1991 and
participated in the division of Yugoslavia are still in power.
``Balkan leaders don't want to step down from power,''
Izetbegovic jokingly told a press conference.
For months, Izetbegovic signaled that he intended to withdraw
from state politics and concentrate on serving as president of the
ruling Muslim Party of Democratic Action, or SDA. He cited health
problems and old age as reasons why he wanted to step aside.
Izetbegovic said he was sure he would pull out of public life
until late Thursday, when 68 out of 88 party leaders demanded that
he become a candidate for Bosnia's three-member presidency.
At Friday's press conference, Izetbegovic indicated he didn't
expect to survive a four-year term as a member of the presidency.
He suffered a second heart attack in February 1996 and was told by
doctors he shouldn't work any more.
Izetbegovic is expected to win most of the Muslim votes and
remain in the joint presidency after September general elections.
But many opposition leaders, independent analysts and experts
foresee the Muslim SDA party _ with or without Izetbegovic _ to
follow the trend of the ruling Bosnian Croat and Serb parties.
The hard-line Bosnian Serb party already has lost its absolute
majority and monopoly over the votes of most Bosnian Serbs in the
country, while the same fate is expected for the ruling Bosnian
Croat party after a recent leadership split.
