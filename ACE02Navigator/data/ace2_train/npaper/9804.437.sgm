 TOKYO, March 31

At Bic Camera, one of Japan's most popular consumer electronics chains, you
can buy cameras, stereos and TV sets. Starting Wednesday you can also buy
yen.

In recent days, clerks in its stores have been learning to convert dollars
to yen, and brushing up on their English.

"It's difficult to predict how many people we will get" for the foreign
exchange business, said Tatsuhiko Asaka, an executive with Bic Camera.
"Possibly 50 or 60 customers a day, but I don't really know."

Wednesday is the official start of "Big Bang," Japan's program to
deregulate its strictly controlled financial markets by 2001. Bic Camera is
just one of countless companies that will jump into businesses that for
decades were closed to them by law.

The aim is to open up the country to global capital, drawing in foreign
banks and securities firms to transform Tokyo into a vibrant financial
center to rival New York and London. At the same time, officials hope, it
will strengthen Japan's many faltering financial institutions and help them
stoke an economy that has been locked in stagnation for much of the '90s.

Over time, the shifts could encourage Japan's people to send abroad more of
the estimated $ 10 trillion that they hold in personal savings and
financial assets, many analysts believe.

Masaru Takagi, an economics professor at Meiji University in Tokyo,
predicts that in 10 years, about 10 percent of Japan's savings will be
invested overseas.

Others believe things will move more slowly. "I don't expect to see a
significant change as of April 1," said Mitsuru Saito, market economist for
Sanwa Bank.

Over time, Japanese may begin to shift to overseas investments, Saito said,
"but capital will not just be flowing one way. It will be flowing into
Japan as well as out. Particularly now -- with more foreign interest in
buying Japanese real estate and companies, foreign money could flow in."

The latest steps build on changes enacted last year that made it easier for
Japanese to buy mutual funds, both foreign and domestic. For instance,
mutual fund companies were allowed to sell their products in banks. In
December, U.S. firm Fidelity Investments set up booths in numerous banks.
Analysts and bankers say sales have been slow, but Fidelity officials
responded that they viewed the effort as an educational process. Fidelity
is launching its own phone sales operation Wednesday.

One reason many analysts predict a gradual change is the generally
conservative investment attitude of the typical Japanese. In a report
issued today, the Bank of Japan found that during October and December of
last year, as the Japanese stock market headed down, investments in mutual
funds fell by 16 percent and stock holdings fell by 22.6 percent, while
cash on hand grew by 7.9 percent.

Shozo Yamane, a 73-year-old sake brewer, said he is not interested in risky
investments. He said the stock and currency markets are a game "only
younger people should play. At my age, I cannot afford to make such a
loss."

Investment advisers say that they have been surprised by the amount of
interest from people in their twenties and thirties.

"I'm thinking of dabbling in it myself," said Hiroko Ohta, a 28-year-old
reporter for the popular weekly magazine Shukan Josei, which is aimed at
the twentyish crowd. The current issue strayed from its usual fare of
articles on celebrity romances and modeling tips to feature a story by Ohta
entitled: "Big Bang. All It Takes Is 10 Minutes to Understand."

"I'm always interested in doing something trendy, so now I am interested in
mutual funds," Ohta said.

Fidelity, Merrill Lynch and other U.S. institutions have said they expect
to do well in the emerging freewheeling environment. Indeed, a survey by a
major Japanese institution found that a significant percentage of people
said they planned to increase transactions with Citibank, while cutting
their business with many Japanese banks. When asked what banks they
intended to use most, Citibank ranked second, surpassed only by Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi.

The Big Bang phase that begins Wednesday will remove many foreign exchange
controls, allowing money to flow more freely across Japan's borders. It
will lift controls on commissions on securities trades of more than $
385,000, to encourage more competition. It will let anyone get into the cur
rency-changing business, with no license required.

If fully carried out over the coming three years, Big Bang would turn on
its head many of the principles that guided Japan's postwar financial
industry. For years, the government divided up the market, letting certain
types of institutions do only certain types of business -- for instance,
trust banks could manage pension funds, but ordinary banks could not.
Countless types of simple transactions required a bureaucrat's stamp of
approval.

The government maintained that this ensured order and stability in a
crucial economic sector that took in savings and provided capital for
export industries. Now, the prevailing view is that the protections have
created weakness and dependency, while foreign banks and brokerage houses
have become lean and efficient.

All over Japan, banks and finance companies are holding hundreds of
billions of dollars of bad loans left from the collapse of the "bubble
economy" of the 1980s. The government has been moving ahead with the
changes despite concerns they will push some weak firms into collapse,
saying that could be the price of future buoyancy.

Already officials have shown they are willing to let the truly sick
institutions die. Yamaichi Securities Co., once Japan's largest securities
house, officially closed its last offices today, four months after
authorities revealed the severity of its losses.

Though officials use the term Big Bang, as if everything happens at once,
they have in fact been nibbling away at many rules for years. According to
Clifford J. Shaw, president of Mercury Asset Management Japan Ltd.,
Japanese already can buy foreign stocks, foreign mutual funds and hold
foreign currency deposits in Japan, in banks such as Citibank and Sanwa
Bank.

For individual investors, the major change under the new rules will be
freedom to open bank accounts overseas without government approval,
eliminating paperwork and hassles. Analysts here say that some Japanese
will shift funds to foreign banks to take advantage of higher interest
rates, but that the numbers probably will be limited because of the
potential for foreign-currency losses if the value of the yen suddenly were
to rise.

"It's also possible money will flow overseas to evade taxes," Inoue said.

For institutional investors, the major change will be an end to
restrictions on how much domestic pension funds must invest in Japanese
markets. For the past two years, the Japanese government has permitted
Japanese pension funds to apply for exemptions from those restrictions on a
case-by-case basis, Shaw said. So "I don't see this as being a sort of
crash, bang, wallop thing, but rather a steady burn," he said.

Another reform taking effect on Wednesday will allow any company and
individual to make foreign exchange transactions. News media have predicted
that convenience stores and a host of other retailers would plunge into
this business. But so far, no convenience store has stepped forward.

"I think most places are taking a wait-and-see attitude," said Asaka of Bic
Camera, one of the few retailers with plans to try the currency business.
