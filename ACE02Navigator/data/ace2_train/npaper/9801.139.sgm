SARAJEVO, Bosnia, Jan. 22-
 


U.S. troops today acted for the first time to capture an alleged Bosnian war 
criminal, rushing from unmarked vans parked in the northern Serb-dominated city 
of Bijeljina to seize a former concentration camp commander accused of killing 
at least 16 Muslims and abusing or terrorizing scores of others. 

Goran Jelisic, a 29-year-old who described himself a "Serb Adolf" and had made 
little attempt to hide his presence in the city, was surrounded without incident 
as he left his apartment at roughly 8 a.m. He then was transferred to Tuzla, 
site of the main U.S. military base in Bosnia, and immediately flown to The 
Hague, where he was placed in the custody of officials from the International 
War Crimes Tribunal there. 

The U.S. military action was planned in advance, according to officials here. 
But it was carried out during a week in which human rights groups have sharply 
criticized the Clinton administration for refusing to let U.S. troops seize any 
of the dozens of the indicted war crimes suspects still at large in this 
country. U.S. forces provided backup support to British troops that fatally shot 
one Serb and captured another last July and to Dutch troops that seized two 
Croats in December. 

The U.S. Embassy here issued a general warning to Americans that they could be 
at risk for reprisals. But Jelisic was probably one of the least provocative 
targets Washington could pick. He is not considered close to the hard-line Serb 
leadership and, according to one well-informed diplomat here, "was not popular" 
among fellow Serbs in Bijeljina. A U.S. military officer said he was "a thug" 
without political standing. 

Graham Blewitt, deputy prosecutor of the war crimes tribunal, nonetheless hailed 
Jelisic's arrest and said the allegations against him "are very serious. The 
offenses committed were horrific, and the accused was personally involved in a 
lot of them. We regard him as a significant arrest." 

Blewitt added that "we hope this is not the end of it," alluding to the 
approximately 50 additional publicly indicted war crimes suspects who have not 
been turned over to the tribunal. An unknown number of combatants have been 
indicted secretly by the tribunal, which the United Nations established in 1993 
to seek justice for the horrendous human rights abuses that occurred during the 
1992-1995 ethnic war. 

The two Bosnian entities -- the Serb Republic and Croat-Muslim federation -- are 
required under the 1995 Dayton peace accord that imposed a cease-fire here to 
surrender all accused war criminals within their jurisdictions. But the top two 
targets, hard-line Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and former Serb military chief 
Ratko Mladic, are well-protected by armed guards. The West's strategy has been 
to try to undermine their power. 

The U.S. military maintains an estimated 8,000 troops in the northeast 
"corridor" of Bosnia that includes Bijeljina, a city of fewer than 100,000 
people that remains home to many hard-line Serbs. But the city itself is not 
patrolled routinely by Americans and instead falls under the responsibility of 
Russian peacekeeping forces operating under NATO command. Officials here say 
that Moscow's policy bars any involvement by its soldiers in capturing war 
criminals, however, and the Russians were not informed in advance of the 
American operation. 

In a June 1995 indictment by the tribunal, Jelisic was charged with genocide, 
crimes against humanity, violations of the laws or customs of war, and grave 
breaches of the Geneva Conventions governing the treatment of prisoners of war. 
The allegations grew out of reports that he systematically killed Muslims who 
had been detained at a bus company, a police headquarters in the city of Brcko, 
and the Luka concentration camp. 

In addition, according to a U.N. spokesman here, Jelisic "created an atmosphere 
of terror [at the camp] by killing, abusing and threatening the detainees, 
thereby subjecting them to extreme psychological trauma, degradation and fear." 
Some of the evidence to be presented by the tribunal is based on exhumations 
conducted near Brcko last year. 

Dutch National Radio reported in December that Jelisic told an interviewer he 
had no regrets for his actions in Brcko, saying he slept well because "I never 
used knives to kill people. . . . That's why God invented the pistol." 

When he was captured today, Jelisic was carrying a pistol, according to U.S. 
officials in Washington. 

The tribunal's chief prosecutor, Louise Arbour, has promised speedy trials for 
all those detained. But the tribunal has four trials underway and five more 
awaiting a courtroom, making it unlikely that Jelisic will be tried for another 
year, officials said. 

Arbour's predecessor, Richard Goldstone and a group of former U.S. and allied 
officials and jurists have criticized the Clinton administration for not 
ordering U.S. troops to seize alleged war criminals. Goldstone said the U.S. 
failure to act had provoked contempt for the Dayton accord and impeded the 
creation of a new Bosnian nation. 

But today, an organizer of the group, Nina Bang-Jensen of the Coalition for 
International Justice in Washington, praised the administration for 
orchestrating an "important arrest."
