Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, persuaded by the Clinton administration peace 
team to pay a groundbreaking visit to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum next 
week, angrily canceled the plan after museum officials rebuffed his overture. 

Conceived as a gesture of reconciliation by U.S. deputy special Mideast envoy 
Aaron Miller, Arafat's visit would have been the first to the exhibition on Nazi 
genocide by a major Arab leader and a highly symbolic acknowledgment of the 
defining event of the century for many Jews. By the time plans for the visit had 
fallen apart yesterday, the episode had become the latest irritant in the 
faltering talks between Israel and the Palestinians. 

Arafat is coming to Washington for talks on Thursday with President Clinton, who 
will also meet Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu next week in an effort 
to inject new urgency into their stalled negotiations. Miller and his superior, 
Dennis Ross, both of whom serve on the panel that functions as the Holocaust 
museum's board of directors, suggested the visit to Arafat through 
intermediaries after believing they had won the consent of Miles Lerman, a death 
camp survivor who chairs the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council. 

But museum sources said members of the American Jewish community warned Lerman 
and museum Director Walter Reich that "this [Arafat] is Hitler incarnate," as 
one official put it, and must not be welcomed in the memorial to Hitler's 
victims. When Lerman and Reich informed Arafat he could visit the museum only as 
an individual, without the special measures for security and protocol routinely 
accorded world leaders, Arafat struck the visit from his schedule. 

Lerman, reached at his New Jersey home, said the subject of Arafat and Israel's 
talks with the Palestinian Authority still profoundly divided U.S. and world 
Jewry and "we believe the museum should not get involved in a political dispute 
where half of the people are for something and half are against it." 

"If and when the day will come when peace will be established between the state 
of Israel and the Palestinians then we will be more than happy to receive Arafat 
as a leader and celebrate that achievement," Lerman said. 

Among Arafat's advisers, ever sensitive to loss of face, a tightly restrained 
sense of grievance prevailed yesterday. 

"We didn't create this idea," Nabil Abu Irdineh, who notified Arafat of the snub 
late Thursday night, said in a telephone interview from the West Bank city of 
Nablus. "He said yes. They are saying no. It's as simple as that. We have been 
extending our hands since the days of [Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak] Rabin, 
and our hands are still slapped. Somebody is still living in the past." 

Lerman and museum spokeswoman Mary Morrison emphasized that the federally funded 
memorial cannot lawfully turn away any individual and would make no attempt to 
do so if Arafat simply turned up at the popular tourist draw. 

"The doors are open from 10 in the morning to 5:30 in the afternoon," Lerman 
said. 

But Lerman also added that the museum would not extend Arafat the formal 
courtesies that are routine for other world leaders, and museum officials said 
they well understood that withholding special coordination effectively rendered 
the visit impossible. 

"You're obviously not going to have Yasser Arafat standing in line to get a 
pass," one official said. 

Arafat and his aides had approached the visit gingerly, according to several 
people directly involved in the plans. Competing self-images of victimhood have 
long prevented Israelis and Arabs from acknowledging the full weight of each 
other's historical tragedies, and many Arab leaders have resisted efforts to 
lure them to the museum and the similar Yad Vashem memorial in Jerusalem. 

Miller and Ross felt strongly, according to officials familiar with their views, 
that a quiet visit to the memorial could mark a psychological breakthrough for 
skeptical Jews and help Arafat understand the fears of an adversary he has 
experienced primarily as a regional superpower. 

Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, her spokesman James P. Rubin said in 
an interview yesterday, routinely encourages world leaders to visit the memorial 
but "with regard to Chairman Arafat, it is particularly important that he visit 
because the horrors of the Holocaust were a defining event in Jewish history." 

Among those who helped overcome the Palestinian leader's initial concerns were 
former congressman Wayne Owens, who heads the Center for Middle East Peace and 
Economic Cooperation. Owens participated in a conference call last week with 
Mohammed Rasheed, a key aide to Arafat, and sent a memo, he said, arguing that 
"it would be a nice symbolic thing for him to do, an appropriate gesture." 

Hani Masri, a Palestinian American businessman who often represents Arafat 
informally in Washington, said he told Arafat all the arguments of Miller and 
Ross "and Arafat said fine." 

"I thought we should concentrate on positive things," Masri said, "and having 
him be the first Arab leader to visit the museum would bring our communities 
together." 

But Thursday night, Lerman told Masri that the museum would not cooperate. 

"Hani called me at home, he's almost crying," said another former official who 
played an intermediary role. 

An Arab diplomat in Washington familiar with the episode, said, "It shows that 
some people have not got over their complexes yet." Associates of Arafat 
described him as furious. 

Lerman, for his part, said he intended no slight. 

"I would be heartbroken if the peace process fell apart," he said, emphasizing 
that he spoke for himself and not the museum. "Arafat is the leader of the 
Palestinian people, and I believe he is trying his best."
