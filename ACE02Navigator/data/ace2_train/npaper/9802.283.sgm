Monica S. Lewinsky spent part of a weekend afternoon in late 1995 alone with 
President Clinton in the Oval Office, a retired Secret Service officer said 
yesterday. 

Clinton testified last month that he does not recall ever being alone with 
Lewinsky, either while she was employed at the White House or later at the 
Pentagon, except perhaps on very brief occasions when she dropped off papers in 
his office, according to sources familiar with Clinton's testimony. 

Former uniformed Secret Service officer Lewis C. Fox said in an interview 
yesterday that Lewinsky, then a White House intern, spent at least 40 minutes 
alone with Clinton while Fox was posted outside the Oval Office door. She had 
arrived with papers for the president, he said, and Clinton instructed Fox to 
usher her into his office. 

Clinton was questioned in a closed-door deposition Jan. 17 in the Paula Jones 
sexual harassment case about whether he had sexual relationships with Lewinsky 
and other government employees. 

Fox is the first person to publicly say that he saw the president and Lewinsky 
alone together. As a result, his statement could be critical to independent 
counsel Kenneth W. Starr's attempt to determine whether Clinton did have a 
relationship with Lewinsky and then attempt to conceal it. 

The White House said it could not confirm or deny Fox's account, but raised 
questions about it because, an official said, only the president's assistants 
allow people in to see him, even on weekends. 

"Without commenting on the specifics, the story is at odds with the common 
standard procedure, where White House staff make decisions on access to the Oval 
Office, not security officers," said a White House official who asked not to be 
named. "That would be a real deviation from standard practice." 

Fox, who retired after 27 years with the Secret Service in January 1997, said he 
is uncertain of the exact date when Lewinsky visited the Oval Office, but said 
he believes it was a Saturday afternoon in either September, October or November 
1995. Lewinsky told onetime friend Linda R. Tripp -- who secretly tape-recorded 
many of their conversations and gave them to investigators -- that she began a 
sexual relationship with Clinton on Nov. 15, 1995, according to an affidavit 
Tripp made in the Jones case. 

Secret Service spokesman Arnette Heintze said his office would not comment on 
what Fox or other Secret Service personnel may have seen because the Lewinsky 
matter is the subject of Starr's ongoing investigation. 

Fox said the day he witnessed Lewinsky visit Clinton, he was posted for a 
one-hour shift outside the Oval Office door. It was around midday, he said, and 
he had been on duty 15 to 20 minutes when Lewinsky arrived saying she had some 
paperwork she needed to bring in to the president. 

Fox said the president's secretary, Betty Currie, was not on duty that day. Fox 
said he opened the Oval Office door and told Clinton there were papers for him. 
The president was able to see Lewinsky through the doorway, Fox said, and he 
told the officer to send her in. Fox said he remained at his post for another 40 
minutes or so before he was relieved by another officer. During that time, 
Lewinsky was behind the closed doors of the Oval Office with Clinton. 

Fox said he was not aware of what occurred between Clinton and Lewinsky. 

Fox, who lives in Waynesburg, Pa., was interviewed on WPXI television in 
Pittsburgh last week and said he saw Lewinsky in the White House. Since that 
broadcast, he has been contacted by the association that represents Secret 
Service officers and discouraged from revealing anything more about what he saw. 
Officials at the television station said they received a subpoena from Starr for 
the videotape of the Fox interview and have given it to investigators. 

Secret Service director Lewis Merletti has met with lawyers from Starr's office 
on the issue of whether agents and officers who guard the president can be 
compelled to testify about whether they witnessed encounters between Clinton and 
Lewinsky. 

The Secret Service is concerned that allowing agents to testify would set a 
dangerous precedent, engendering mistrust at the White House and ultimately 
making it more difficult for them to guard the president. With that matter 
unresolved, Starr has refrained from subpoenaing any Secret Service officers, 
including Fox.
