DUBLIN, Feb. 20-
 


Britain and Ireland today suspended Sinn Fein, the Irish Republican Army's 
political ally, from the Northern Ireland peace talks, prompting concern that 
violence could erupt again in the British province. 

British and Irish officials went to Belfast to inform Sinn Fein leaders that two 
recent slayings police blamed on the IRA disqualify the party from a place at 
the negotiating table. But the officials made clear they were acting reluctantly 
and wanted Sinn Fein back. 

They specified that the suspension will last until March 9 but warned that Sinn 
Fein could be expelled permanently if the IRA kills again. They also agreed to 
hold back-door communications with Sinn Fein so that it can be heard in the 
negotiations during the suspension. 

[Late Friday, a car bomb exploded near a police station in Moira, 20 miles south 
of Belfast, causing widespread damage and minor injuries to about a dozen 
people, police and hospital personnel said, according to news services. There 
was no initial claim of responsibility.] 

Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams called the suspension "disgraceful." 

"The process by which this decision was reached lacks any notion of natural 
justice or fairness," Adams said. But he urged supporters to show restraint. "I 
want to appeal to everyone to stay calm, to channel their anger and their 
frustration, if they wish to, into calm and disciplined protest," he said. 

Many people in Northern Ireland fear that any violent street demonstrations or 
new attacks by the IRA in response to the suspension will effectively end the 
talks, which aim to end three decades of violence between the province's 
Protestant majority and Catholic minority. 

Reacting to the decision, several hundred people chanted "No justice, no peace!" 
outside police stations in Catholic west Belfast and in Londonderry, Northern 
Ireland's second-largest city, the Associated Press reported. In north Belfast, 
protesters scuffled with police and soldiers guarding Protestant homes. Bigger 
weekend protests are scheduled in both cities. 

British and Irish officials said they had no choice but to suspend Sinn Fein 
once police in Northern Ireland linked the IRA to two killings there last week. 
Under the rules of the discussions, political parties may take part only if 
their paramilitary allies respect a cease-fire. 

"The principles [of nonviolence] have been demonstrably dishonored," British 
Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Marjorie Mowlam said today in Belfast. 
"Therefore Sinn Fein is no longer entitled to take part in these talks. . . . We 
cannot have the integrity of the process violated." 

Sinn Fein filed suit Wednesday in Dublin to try to block the suspension, 
contending it is separate from the IRA and should not be held accountable for 
IRA actions. Sinn Fein withdrew its court action following today's expulsion. 

Britain and Ireland ejected Sinn Fein reluctantly, since any hope for lasting 
peace hinges on the support of the IRA, the province's most powerful Catholic 
paramilitary group. 

"I look forward to their return on March 9," said Irish Foreign Minister David 
Andrews, who with Mowlam met with Adams and other Sinn Fein leaders in Belfast 
today. 

Meanwhile, reports of another apparently sectarian slaying in Northern Ireland 
underlined how often the cease-fire is violated and how difficult it is to 
determine who is responsible. On Wednesday, a Catholic man was found shot dead 
in a deserted farmhouse, his arms tied behind his back. A Protestant 
paramilitary group that operates in the area, the Loyalist Volunteer Force, 
denied responsibility. 

Sinn Fein's suspension was intended in part to satisfy Protestant leaders. But 
representatives of Protestant parties contended today that Sinn Fein received 
special treatment even as it was thrown out. They noted that a small Protestant 
group, the Ulster Democratic Party, was given no return date when it was ejected 
last month after its paramilitary ally admitted killing three Catholics. Britain 
and Ireland announced today the Ulster Democratic Party will be allowed to 
return to the talks on Monday.
