VENILALE, Indonesia, June 24-
 


For one day last week this mountain village in East Timor displayed the kind of 
social harmony that Indonesia has tried to enforce here during 23 years of 
military occupation. Indonesian military commanders dressed in civilian clothes 
and wearing awkward smiles joined hands and danced with East Timorese in 
traditional costumes to celebrate the inauguration of a new wing of the Roman 
Catholic Sacred Heart Church. 

Venilale's chief of police and the army commander, both Catholics, sang hymns in 
the church choir. Their subordinates, who are predominantly Muslim, helped 
fashion the decorations for the celebration. "They make beautiful flowers," said 
Sister Lucia Pereira of the Salesian order in Venilale. 

That the meeting should have happened in a Catholic church was particularly 
meaningful. Under Indonesia's rule, the Catholic Church in Timor has emerged as 
a protector of the political opposition in the former Portuguese colony that 
Indonesia invaded in 1975 and annexed the following year. 

Parishes throughout East Timor offer sanctuary for victims of human rights 
abuses, and church-linked organizations often serve as forums for underground 
groups seeking to win independence from Indonesia. Eighty percent of East 
Timor's residents are Catholic, while 90 percent of Indonesia's 200 million 
people are Muslim -- and less than 3 percent of Indonesians are Catholic. 

Bishop Carlos Belo, who has become a de facto president for the East Timorese 
because of his efforts to end human rights abuses by the military, met with 
Indonesian President B.J. Habibie today to discuss the status of the territory. 
Belo told reporters they talked about an agreement but he declined to give 
details. He said the military would withdraw "little by little" from the region 
but gave no timetable. 

He also indicated that Habibie's stated policy toward East Timor was more 
conciliatory than that of his predecessor, Suharto, who stepped down last month 
after 32 years in power. 

"He shows himself as a big politician and a big president," Belo said of 
Habibie. "He's ready with his government to improve the situation in East Timor 
for the better, how to help the people of East Timor live in dignity." 

Following mounting protests against Indonesian rule, Habibie has proposed a plan 
that would give the territory a degree of autonomy, except in the areas of 
finance, foreign affairs and security. 

Timorese activists have said that a referendum is the only way to determine the 
region's future. The United Nations still recognizes Portugal as the territory's 
administrative authority. Meetings between Portugal, Indonesia and the United 
Nations have not resolved East Timor's status during more than 10 years of 
negotiations. 

The participation of Belo, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1996 along with 
self-exiled Timorese leader Jose Ramos-Horta, is key to reaching a solution on 
East Timor, activists here say. He is one of the few people Timorese say they 
trust, even though at times his quick temper can make him appear as autocratic 
as a man in military uniform. 

"The bishop is like God for them," said a Salesian nun in Dili, the East 
Timorese capital. "Everybody goes to him -- the simple people. If they have an 
argument over pigs or property they go to him. Who [else] would they go to? The 
police? The police are all with the military. The military can't speak" the 
local language. 

In an apparent effort to bring the military and the local population closer 
together, a number of Catholic and other Christian Indonesian officers have been 
appointed to command positions in Venilale, about three hours east of the 
capital, and elsewhere in the territory. 

Sgt. Antonius Karolus, the Indonesian police chief in Venilale, is a Catholic 
who is active in local church activities. He lives in the village with his wife 
and children and said he feels as though he is part of the community. "Where 
would I go?" he said. "I've lived here for 11 years." 

Timorese remain skeptical of the military's commitment to foster goodwill 
through religion and doubt whether it helps. They say they see Catholic soldiers 
first and foremost as Indonesians. "It is quite different to be an Indonesian 
Catholic," said a human rights worker with the Justice and Peace Commission in 
Dili. "They bring their culture and their nationalism to impose on East Timor. 
They are Catholic but they represent Indonesian sovereignty that they want to 
impose on the people." 

"Even Catholic priests from Indonesia -- people will not make confession to 
them," he said. 

The soldiers have their own suspicions about the church, in part because several 
resistance leaders, including Xanana Gusmao, who is in jail, studied at 
seminaries in the territory. 

"Even the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts in the church, the military says they are 
being trained for future empowerment," said an activist who goes by the name of 
Vico. 

Suharto tried to win the souls of the Timorese a few years ago by making a gift: 
a massive statue of Jesus on a hill, looking toward Dili. 

But when it was unveiled, as Suharto circled in a helicopter, it was revealed to 
be somewhat of a false idol. Officials announced that it was 27 meters tall, 
representing the 27 provinces of Indonesia. It is 17 meters across, 
commemorating July 17, the date on which Indonesia "integrated" East Timor. The 
foundation is five meters high, representing the five points of pancasilla, the 
Indonesian state ideology, which promotes religious tolerance, among other 
tenets. 

"That is how Jesus was born and made by the Indonesians," Vico said. "His hands 
are like this," he said, stretching out his arms and turning up his palms: 
"Surrender to Indonesia."
