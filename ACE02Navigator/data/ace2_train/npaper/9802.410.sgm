US Airways Group Inc. announced plans yesterday to repurchase nearly $ 1 billion 
in stock and retire another $ 379 million in debt to bolster the airline's 
financial position as it prepares to start new low-cost operations on the East 
Coast. 

US Airways Chairman Stephen M. Wolf, who took over the financially troubled 
airline two years ago, said the move was designed to reduce interest and 
dividend payments, improve the Arlington-based company's balance sheet and 
improve shareholder value. Wolf said in a statement that since he became 
chairman, the airline has made "tremendous strides" in both its operating and 
financial performance and now is in a position to use its nearly $ 2 billion in 
cash to strengthen the value of its stock. 

US Airways recently negotiated contract concessions from its pilots and is in 
talks with its other unions on similar contracts as it plans to launch low-cost 
service out of Baltimore Washington International airport soon to compete on the 
East Coast with Southwest Airlines and Delta Express, Delta's low-cost 
operation. 

The airline said it plans to buy back up to $ 500 million worth of common stock 
as well as $ 358 million in preferred stock held by billionaire investor Warren 
E. Buffett through affiliates of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Buffett, who made the 
investment in 1989, has the option of converting his holdings into 9.24 million 
shares of the airline's common stock at a conversion price of $ 38.74 a share 
before US Airways redeems his preferred shares. 

US Airways stock closed yesterday at $ 62.12 1/2 a share. If Buffett converts 
and then sells his common shares, he would pocket a profit of more than $ 216 
million, not counting at least $ 264 million he's earned in dividend payments. 
It was unclear yesterday whether Buffett would sell or keep the common stock 
once he converts his preferred. 

In a statement released by his office in Omaha, Buffett praised Wolf for the 
management changes he has made and said "after a dismaying period, we are very 
pleased with our investment in US Airways." Buffett had once told shareholders 
that his investment in the company had been a "mistake." 

When all of the transactions announced yesterday are completed, the airline said 
it still would have "significantly more" than $ 1 billion in cash, assuming a 
full $ 500 million stock repurchase. 

Wolf and US Airways President Rakesh Gangwal are scheduled to outline the 
financial moves, as well as the company's plans for the year, in New York today 
to the Society of Airline Analysts. 

In addition to the new operation out of Baltimore, the airline is in the midst 
of a major aircraft purchase from Airbus Industrie to eventually replace its 
hodgepodge fleet of planes. US Airways also is negotiating with Boeing and 
Airbus for the purchase of new wide-bodied jets for transatlantic service. 

US Airways also is one of the few major airlines without an overseas alliance 
with a foreign carrier to help bolster its transatlantic operations. Company 
officials have said they would wait until the airline was in a position of 
economic strength before they would seek such a partnership. It was unclear 
yesterday whether company officials believed they had now reached that point.
