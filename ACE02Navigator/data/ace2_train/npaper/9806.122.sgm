Monica S. Lewinsky has agreed to provide independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr 
with information about her book purchases, resolving a First Amendment dispute 
between Starr and the Dupont Circle bookstore Kramerbooks. 

"We've accomplished what we set out to do, which is protect the rights of 
privacy of our customers," said Bill Kramer, co-owner of the popular store and 
cafe. 

The former White House intern, the central figure in Starr's investigation of 
President Clinton, has previously made cooperative gestures toward Starr, 
including allowing her apartment to be searched and providing handwriting 
samples. 

In late March, Starr subpoenaed Kramerbooks and the Georgetown outlet of the 
Barnes & Noble chain, asking for details about at least 16 purchases made by 
Lewinsky. The former intern reportedly told her one-time friend Linda R. Tripp 
that she gave Clinton the phone-sex novel "Vox," and Starr's team was seeking to 
corroborate that statement. 

On April 6, Lewinsky lawyer Nathaniel H. Speights told U.S. District Court Judge 
Norma Holloway Johnson that his client would be willing to give the information 
to Starr. 

"In March, April, May, it was crystal clear that Lewinsky's position was the 
same: She was willing to give the information," said Kramerbooks lawyer Carol 
O'Riordan. "And it was crystal clear to my co-counsel and myself that [Starr] 
was refusing to go and ask for it." 

Johnson ruled in early April that Starr had to show a "compelling need" for the 
information before he violated the First Amendment rights of Lewinsky and the 
bookstores. This led to the Barnes & Noble subpoena being dropped and the 
Kramerbooks subpoena narrowed. Kramer had been planning an appeal when 
yesterday's deal was worked out. 

"This agreement allows us to avoid the time and expense of the appeal," Kramer 
said. 

Kramerbooks' challenge to Starr drew support from a wide range of retailing, 
publishing and free speech sources. Yesterday, those groups pronounced 
themselves pleased with the case's resolution. 

"From the beginning we believed the subpoena was an example of gross 
prosecutorial overreaching that seriously threatened core First Amendment 
values," said Louis Bograd of the American Civil Liberties Union. 

"We've established an important precedent that will stop prosecutors from 
fishing around in bookstore records just because they want to," said Chris 
Finan, president of the American Booksellers Foundation for Free Expression. 

If Kramerbooks' appeal had gone forward, there was some doubt it would have won. 
"Establishing a legal basis for bookstores' privilege would have been a tough 
sell," said Robert O'Neil, a University of Virginia law professor. He noted that 
there was no constitutional protection for journalists seeking to withhold 
identity of sources. 

Still, O'Neil said, "the next time a grand jury or a prosecutor seeks to compel 
such information from a bookseller, he can look back and cite this as a time 
when the customer turned out not only to be the appropriate source for the 
information, but an entirely adequate one." 

In another legal battle over evidence, the Justice Department filed the final 
brief in its effort to persuade the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit 
to stop Starr from bringing Secret Service officers before a grand jury. The 
Justice Department is appealing a lower court ruling that the Secret Service 
enjoys no legal right of confidentiality.
