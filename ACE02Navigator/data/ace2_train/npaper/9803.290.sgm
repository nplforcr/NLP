Nolanda S. Hill, the onetime business partner of the late Commerce Secretary 
Ronald H. Brown, was indicted yesterday by a federal grand jury on charges that 
she diverted more than $ 200,000 from companies she controlled to buy clothes 
and jewelry for herself and failed to report it as income on her tax returns. 

Hill, 53, a Dallas broadcasting entrepreneur who owned WFTY-TV (Channel 50) in 
Washington and another station in Massachusetts, also was charged with diverting 
more than $ 557,000 from one of her companies to her partner. Although Brown was 
not named in the indictment, he was her partner in that company, First 
International Communications Corp., which failed to put together any successful 
business ventures during its existence. 

The nine-count indictment also charged Kenneth C. White, 49, a Maryland resident 
and former executive of one of her companies. The case results from an 
investigation by the Justice Department that was begun by former independent 
counsel Daniel S. Pearson. The Justice Department took over the probe after 
Brown died in a plane crash in Croatia in 1996 and Pearson closed his office. 

The charges against Hill and White include conspiracy to defraud the Internal 
Revenue Service, conspiracy to defraud the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., 
making false statements and aiding and assisting in the preparation of false tax 
returns. 

One of Hill's attorneys, Courtney Simmons Elwood, said yesterday that Hill is 
"innocent" and "deeply regrets that the government's investigation [of Brown] 
has ended with unfounded charges against his former business associates." 

Before his death, Brown repeatedly denied wrongdoing. His attorney, Reid H. 
Weingarten, said yesterday that the grand jury not only did not name Brown, but 
did not charge that he was "a knowing participant in wrongdoing." 

The grand jury said that Hill spent thousands of dollars on trips to tropical 
climates, and on jewelry and designer clothes at expensive stores and boutiques 
from Beverly Hills to Boston. She shopped at such high-priced stores as Gucci at 
the Watergate, Jean Claude Jitrois of Beverly Hills, and Escada Boutique in Palm 
Beach. 

During the time of the alleged illegal activities, Hill was president of 
Corridor Broadcasting Corp., a Texas company that owned Channel 50 and WHLL-TV 
in the Boston area. 

The grand jury said that during the mid-1980s, Corridor borrowed $ 21 million 
from Sunbelt Savings & Loan in Texas. Corridor did not make payments on the 
loan, which the FDIC took over as creditor after Sunbelt failed. 

In meetings with FDIC officials, Hill and White allegedly lied about Corridor's 
financial condition and supplied the agency with doctored books and records that 
hid numerous diversions of funds. 

According to the indictment, Hill siphoned off nearly $ 200,000 from Corridor 
and another $ 37,000 from another company to cover her shopping binges. She 
allegedly spent that money at the same time she collected a generous annual 
salary that ranged from $ 170,000 to nearly $ 260,000 from 1990 to 1994. 

At the same time, Hill formed First International Communications Corp. to pursue 
possible foreign and domestic business ventures. Her partner in that company was 
Brown, a former chairman of the Democratic National Committee. 

Hill, who sometimes shows up to business meetings wearing leather and driving a 
Harley-Davidson motorcycle, often bragged about how her business ties to Brown 
provided her with access to Washington's elite, according to friends and other 
sources. She also credited Brown with getting her invited to the White House on 
at least three occasions. 

The grand jury said that Hill and White diverted large sums of money from 
Corridor and another company, Jasas Corp., "for the purpose of making payments 
to and for the benefit of [Hill's] business partner" in First International and 
her limited partner in yet another business venture, FICC Limited Partnership. 
Brown was that partner. 

Pearson, the independent counsel, was appointed in 1995 to investigate how Brown 
made nearly $ 500,000 by selling his interest in First International. 

In exchange for selling his interest back to the firm, Brown received $ 135,000 
in cash, forgiveness of a $ 72,000 debt he owed to another company owned by Hill 
and an agreement that $ 300,000 in his personal debts would be paid off. 

Although again not naming Brown, the grand jury said Hill and White diverted 
nearly $ 300,000 in company funds to Hill's personal attorney, who, in turn, 
used the money to pay off Brown's debts. 

Hill allegedly used her companies' funds to pay off her debts as well. Her 
shopping sprees rarely cost less than $ 1,000 and cost as much as $ 5,438, which 
she spent in one day in 1993 at St. John Boutique in Dallas. 

She also spent thousands of dollars on airline tickets to the Bahamas, London 
and Ecuador for herself, her family and friends, according to the grand jury. 

The indictment said Hill failed to reimburse her companies and should have 
reported the funds she received as income on her tax returns for 1991, 1992 and 
1993. 

While she spent the money, she allegedly lied to Sunbelt loan officials in 1989 
about Corridors' operations by painting a "bleak financial picture," according 
to the grand jury. 

Two years later, Hill and White allegedly told Sunbelt officials that Corridor 
had a cash flow crisis and couldn't make payments on its loan. Hill also 
allegedly lied when she said she was not drawing a salary and was paying 
corporate legal fees out of her own pocket.
