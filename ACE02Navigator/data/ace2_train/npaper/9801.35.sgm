The Senate yesterday confirmed three federal judges in its first official action 
of the year, slightly reducing the backlog of nominations that has drawn 
criticism from both President Clinton and Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist. 

But the dispute over the Senate's pace in dealing with nominations continued, 
with Republicans defending the record while Democrats charged the GOP with 
politicizing the process. 

By a vote of 67 to 30, the Senate confirmed Ann L. Aiken for a U.S. District 
Court vacancy in Oregon. Her nomination had been held up for months by Sen. Mike 
Enzi (R-Wyo.), who accused her of leniency in sentencing a child molester when 
she was a state court judge. 

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) said that while 
Aiken would not have been his choice, she "demonstrated to me that she 
understands the proper role of a federal judge in our constitutional system." 

By voice vote, the Senate also confirmed Richard W. Story for the federal 
district court in Georgia and Barry G. Silverman of Arizona for the Ninth U.S. 
Circuit Court of Appeals, which has jurisdiction over California and other 
western states. 

Yesterday's action reduces the list of judicial vacancies to 85, or about 10 
percent of the federal judiciary. The Senate confirmed 17 judges in 1996 and 36 
judges last year, drawing accusations of foot-dragging from Democrats. Hatch and 
others said Clinton was mostly to blame because he was slow to make nominations. 


More than 50 nominations are pending before the Senate, including 12 made on 
Tuesday. 

The long-simmering dispute over the Senate's performance on nominations came to 
a head when Rehnquist warned in a year-end report that the judicial vacancies 
were threatening the nation's "quality of justice" and the White House pounced 
on his words to mount a campaign for speedier action. 

With early decisions on Aiken, Story and Silverman, Senate Republicans tried to 
show they are not delaying confirmations. 

If the White House intends to wage a battle over the nominations to portray the 
Republicans as anti-women and anti-minority, as newspapers have reported, then 
that is "certainly a poor way to begin what I hope will turn out to be a 
cooperative effort to confirm federal judges," Hatch said. 

Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (Vt.), the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary panel, 
responded that Republicans are jeopardizing the "independence and integrity" of 
the judiciary by trying to hold up Clinton's nominees and threatening other 
steps, including House threats of impeachment proceedings against liberal 
judges. 

"Partisan and narrow ideological efforts to impose political litmus tests on 
judicial nominees and to shut down the judiciary must stop," Leahy said. 

In another contested nomination, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) 
said he intends to seek a vote next week on David Satcher as surgeon general. 
Some Republicans have threatened to try to block the nomination because of 
Satcher's support for administration policy opposing legislation to ban a 
procedure that some call "partial-birth" abortion.
