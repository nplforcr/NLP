ST. THOMAS, Virgin Islands, Jan. 4 -
 


President Clinton will meet with Israeli and Palestinian leaders separately in 
Washington later this month in an attempt to revitalize the Middle East peace 
process that all but died last year, the White House announced today. 

Clinton will host Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu at the White House 
on Jan. 20 and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat two days later. There are no 
plans to bring the two adversaries together, aides said. Clinton has warned both 
publicly that the peace process is in danger of collapsing if they do not resume 
full negotiations soon. 

"The president thought this was the right time to bring both leaders to 
Washington to try to move the peace process forward," said deputy press 
secretary Joe Lockhart, who announced the visits here during the final day of 
Clinton's winter vacation. 

The administration has been trying to push the two sides back on track after 
months of renewed hostility born out of Israeli housing projects in disputed 
neighborhoods, stalled West Bank troop redeployments and Arab terrorist attacks 
in Jewish areas. With Middle East peace once thought to be a central achievement 
of his foreign policy, Clinton feels increasingly anxious that the progress he 
helped bring about may evaporate and leave the volatile region as unsettled as 
ever. 

He was so irritated with what he saw as intransigence by Netanyahu in particular 
that he declined to meet with the Israeli leader when he was in Washington in 
November, a move the prime minister later branded an "insult." 

Administration officials in Washington said they hope this month's back-to-back 
meetings will produce a framework for beginning the next stage of negotiations 
on "final status" issues such as the fate of Jerusalem and a Palestinian 
homeland. 

"It would be good, but we will see whether there's enough concrete progress to 
do that," one senior official who insisted on anonymity said in a telephone 
interview. "That's clearly the objective." 

Another official, who also declined to be named, said Clinton wants to see 
tangible movement on the part of both leaders when they arrive in Washington. 
"We're hoping the prime minister will come with a clear position on further 
withdrawal [of troops from disputed territory] and the timeout [on housing 
construction] -- the two elements we have been talking about with the Israelis 
since the summer," the official said. From Arafat, he added, Clinton will be 
"looking to see if there is continuing concrete performance in security 
cooperation. We're seeing progress in the right direction over the last six 
months, but that is something that has to be unremitting, and there can be no 
letdown there." 

The administration has the impression that both leaders have been nearing the 
point where they can resume negotiations but have cautiously held back. A 
presidential shove, Clinton aides calculate, may be what is needed to break the 
standoff. 

The administration this week is dispatching special Middle East envoy Dennis 
Ross to the region, where he will meet with both Netanyahu and Arafat and then 
report back to Clinton.
