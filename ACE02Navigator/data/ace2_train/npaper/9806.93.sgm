AT&T Corp. formally announced its $ 48 billion takeover of cable TV giant 
Tele-Communications Inc. yesterday, vowing to become the one-stop provider of a 
dazzling array of telecommunications services to households across the country. 

The immediate winner in the deal was TCI's chairman, John C. Malone, who will 
receive AT&T stock worth an estimated $ 15 billion for stock he personally owns 
or votes in trust for TCI's late founder, Bob Magness. TCI's other public 
shareholders will receive AT&T stock worth almost $ 51 per share, a premium of 
nearly 32 percent over TCI's Class A stock closing price on Tuesday, and nearly 
five times the value of the shares only 20 months ago. 

Malone and AT&T Chairman C. Michael Armstrong promised yesterday that millions 
of residential customers will ultimately benefit from the companies' marriage, 
too. By coupling TCI's cable connections with its own long-distance lines and 
familiar brand name, AT&T said it will someday be able to offer the first major 
competition to the regional Bell phone companies, which now hold a near-monopoly 
on local phone service. 

What's more, AT&T envisions a day when customers can obtain, via a single 
monthly bill, all of the major telecommunications services: long-distance, 
cellular and local phone service, high-speed Internet links, as well as 
pay-per-view movies, ESPN's game of the week, and new types of electronic 
shopping. 

Said Malone at a news conference in New York: "If you want to order an extra 
phone line, all you'll have to do is point and click. . . . If you're watching 
an entertainment program and want to order Viagra, all you'll have to do is 
point and click." He added: "We're going to make it easy to use . . . [and] 
packaged in a way so that the consumer gets a terrific deal." 

Combined, the companies will have an impressive reach. AT&T now serves about 
half of all residential long-distance customers, although AT&T must rely on 
local phone firms such as Bell Atlantic Corp. to get to those customers' homes. 
TCI, meanwhile, serves about 10.5 million cable households. But its wires pass 
by a total of 17 million households. It also partially owns companies, such as 
Cablevision Systems Corp. of New York, whose wires pass by another 16 million 
households -- giving AT&T potential direct access to as much as one-third of all 
the nation's households. 

D.C. residents may be among the beneficiaries of AT&T's plan to upgrade 
services, since TCI controls the local cable provider, District Cablevision. But 
Robert L. Johnson, who is chairman of the partnership that owns a portion of the 
D.C. system, said yesterday that it might be a candidate for sale because it 
doesn't fit easily into TCI's cluster of systems in other metropolitan areas. 

ATT is hoping regulators will view the deal as a spur to stalled local phone 
competition. Analysts said, however, that it could give the regional Bells -- 
which were spun off from AT&T in 1984 -- a potent argument that they should now 
be allowed into the long-distance business. And AT&T will still need the 
cooperation of its local phone rivals to serve the two-thirds of the country 
TCI's cable won't reach. 

The creation of the "one-wire world" that Malone and Armstrong described 
yesterday is likely to require billions of dollars of additional investment for 
AT&T and could take years to complete, analysts and AT&T's competitors say. 

Investor worries about this drain on future earnings drove down AT&T stock, the 
most widely held in the country, which fell $ 5.37 1/2 yesterday to close at $ 
60 on the New York Stock Exchange. TCI's Class A shares, in contrast, rose $ 
1.06, to $ 39.75, on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 

Forecasting the telecommunications future has proven notoriously frustrating. 
Malone himself told an industry conference in 1992 that cable customers would 
soon have 500 channels as well as interactive services, such as home shopping, 
and phone calls via cable lines. These improvements have failed to materialize. 

Phone companies also made their own unfulfilled promises about the "convergence" 
of telecommunications services. Bell Atlantic -- whose deal to buy TCI foundered 
in 1993 -- launched two unsuccessful experiments in delivering TV shows, one 
over copper phone lines and another over so-called "wireless" digital relay 
stations. 

For its part, AT&T last year abandoned an effort to market DirecTV's satellite 
TV service through its long-distance operations. (AT&T officials said yesterday 
selling cable service, which is more familiar to consumers, should be easier.) 
It also made an expensive -- and largely unsuccessful -- foray into the computer 
business in 1991, when it bought NCR Corp. for $ 7.4 billion. 

Both Armstrong and Malone vowed yesterday that this time will be different. 

They said AT&T would be able to offer phone service over some of TCI's cable 
systems within 18 months. Upgrades of TCI's network that will enable consumers 
to receive two-way services, such as lightning-fast connections to the Internet, 
will be complete by the end of the year 2000, they added. 

But some doubt those timetables. "It's going to be a while before these things 
are generally available," said William Esrey, chief executive of Sprint Corp., 
one of AT&T's main long-distance rivals and a company that once considered a 
cable-phone partnership with TCI and two other major cable companies. 

"TCI's [network] is not in great shape," though its cable systems have improved, 
Esrey said. "It's not that the cable plant can't be made more reliable. It'll 
just take time." 

When TCI's wires do become capable of offering local phone service, AT&T may be 
required to lease some of their capacity to competitors, under terms of the 
Telecommunications Act of 1996. 

Steve Case, chief executive of America Online Inc., the Dulles-based online 
service, noted that possibility yesterday, saying in a statement: "We look 
forward to entering into a broadband reseller agreement with AT&T once the 
merger with TCI is complete, and we look forward to entering similar agreements 
with other cable companies as they, too, embrace a truly 'open cable' approach." 


In light of all this, Sprint's Esrey questioned whether AT&T was paying too much 
for TCI. In addition to the $ 31.8 billion in stock it will pay for TCI's Class 
A and B shares, AT&T will take on TCI's $ 11 billion in debt, plus lay out $ 5.5 
billion more to buy back TCI's interest in Teleport Communications Group Inc. 
and At Home Corp. 

All told, AT&T reckoned the value of the deal is $ 48 billion -- or a little 
less than twice the annual revenue for the entire cable industry. 

The buyout of TCI will apparently mean a greatly reduced role for Malone, 
perhaps the most powerful man in the cable industry and its best-known figure 
after Time Warner Inc. Vice Chairman Ted Turner. 

Although Malone will be a major AT&T shareholder and a member of the AT&T board, 
his main job will be running Liberty Media Corp., a spinoff from TCI that holds 
its minority investments in such cable networks as Discovery and Black 
Entertainment Television. Said a longtime Malone colleague, "It looks to me like 
John has found his exit strategy."
