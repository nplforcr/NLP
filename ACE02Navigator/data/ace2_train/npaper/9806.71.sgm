BALLEYMONEY, Northern Ireland, June 25-
 


Ian McCartney helped make history in Northern Ireland today -- but he didn't 
find it easy. 

"It's just a wee sheet of paper they give you," the gray-haired chicken farmer 
said as he emerged from the voting booth at Balleymoney Model Primary School. 
"But don't you know, it's a complicated thing to work out." 

McCartney and the other 1.2 million eligible voters in this war-torn British 
province were voting this rainy day on the 108 members of a brand new Northern 
Ireland Assembly, which will take over local government powers here as part of 
the new peace plan designed to end decades of sectarian violence. 

The assembly will give a locally elected government to Northern Ireland for the 
first time in a quarter of a century. The last local parliament was disbanded in 
1972 when the British government concluded the Protestant majority was using it 
to legalize discrimination against Roman Catholics. 

Counting was to begin Friday, with results not expected until Saturday. 

The "complicated thing" facing voters is an electoral system called 
"Proportional Representation With the Single Transferable Vote." Common in 
Europe, it's a voting mechanism designed to ensure the elected assembly 
accurately reflects the wide range of choices available in a jurisdiction with 
many competing political parties. 

Twelve parties, plus a cross section of independent candidates, were on the 
ballots in the 18 assembly districts today. The "wee sheet of paper" required 
voters to allocate their support among an alphabet soup of parties generally 
known by their initials: the D.U.P, the P.U.P, the U.U.P, the U.D.P. 

Five parties represent different strains of the position known here as 
"unionist" -- that is, those who want to retain the political union with 
Britain. Most unionists are Protestant. 

Two major parties represent the "nationalist" position -- those who want to 
break the tie with Britain and form a single nation with the Republic of 
Ireland, which makes up the southern two-thirds of the island. Most nationalists 
are Catholic. 

The other parties are so-called cross-community groupings. Some represent 
specific interests, such as the environmentally minded Green Party, and some 
were created to overcome the sectarian divisions that have sparked street 
warfare and terrorist murder over the past three decades. 

As a reminder of those old animosities, a large car bomb exploded Wednesday in 
the small village of Newtownhamilton, injuring a half-dozen people and wrecking 
homes and cars. Today, though, voters turned out in large numbers in 
Newtownhamilton to demonstrate that they prefer the ballot to the bomb. 

Voters got one vote each -- but each vote could be split among numerous 
candidates. All the candidates in each district are listed on the ballot, and 
voters are asked to rank them in order of preference -- first choice, second 
choice and so on, all the way down to 23rd choice in some districts. The choices 
are then allocated among the various contenders in such a way that the six 
assembly members to be chosen from each district will reflect the range of 
preferences among the electorate. 

"It's a tricky business," McCartney said after spending 15 minutes distributing 
his vote. "You have to give some help to parties you don't normally support. You 
know, that keeps out the one you're absolutely opposed to." 

For some voters in this green, rolling farm district, the choices were simpler. 
Balleymoney is in the North Antrim district, the electoral home of a fiery 
Protestant leader, the Rev. Ian Paisley, who opposes the peace agreement. 
Several people leaving the primary school said they had simply marked Ian 
Paisley and his son, Ian Paisley Jr., as their first and second choices -- and 
ignored every other name on the ballot.
