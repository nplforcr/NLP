Compaq Computer Corp., the world's largest maker of personal computers, said 
yesterday that it will buy Digital Equipment Corp. for $ 9.6 billion in the 
computer industry's largest-ever merger. The deal would create the 
second-largest computer company in the world, one that even giant International 
Business Machines Corp. will have to watch with care. 

"It's been our stated goal to become one of the top three computer companies in 
the world," Compaq chief executive Eckhard Pfeiffer said at a news conference in 
New York. 

The combined company will become the industry's newest giant, with combined 
annual revenue of $ 37 billion based on last year's sales. It will be second 
only to IBM, which had $ 78.5 billion in revenue last year. Hewlett-Packard Co. 
ranks third, with 1997 revenue of $ 35.5 billion from computer products and 
services. 

At the heart of the Digital deal, analysts say, is Compaq's keen interest in 
moving beyond its preeminence in personal computers to build a strong presence 
in the lucrative corporate marketplace. To do that, Compaq needs a corps of 
experts who can advise companies on how to use the latest technology, including 
the sophisticated "server" computers that Compaq also makes. 

"The services [division] is the jewel they're trying to pull out of Digital," 
said Frank Gens, a senior vice president at International Data Corp., a market 
research group in Framingham, Mass. 

Compaq already is the third leg in one of the technology world's most powerful 
alliances, a partnership that began with Microsoft Corp., maker of the dominant 
personal computer operating system, and Intel Corp., whose chips run most of the 
world's PCs. 

Microsoft, Intel and Compaq have fueled the explosive growth of the personal 
computer industry, putting PCs in the hands of millions of consumers and 
businesses. Compaq captured nearly 30 percent of the growth in PC sales last and 
shipped nearly 10 million personal computers, according to Dataquest Inc., an 
industry research firm. 

But Compaq, Intel and Microsoft have set their sights on the more profitable -- 
and more demanding -- market of serving large companies, and they are tailoring 
their future software, chips and computers for that market. Microsoft is pushing 
its Windows NT operating system software, and Intel is developing its "IA-64" 
family of chips, starting with one it calls "Merced." 

Compaq has used Microsoft software and, for the most part, Intel chips to 
achieve its top ranking in PC sales. But two years ago, company managers 
reorganized the firm to focus on corporate customers, said John Rose, a senior 
vice president at Compaq. Last year, Compaq spent $ 3 billion to buy Tandem 
Computers, a longtime maker of sophisticated "fault-tolerant" systems -- 
computers designed to be relatively crash-proof in critical applications. 

By 2000, Rose said, Compaq managers want the company to pull in $ 50 billion in 
revenue, half of it by selling high-end computers such as servers and services 
to corporations, compared with about 37 percent of its revenue from such 
customers before the Digital deal was announced. 

Analysts said the deal was not surprising. Compaq has long considered buying at 
least a portion of Digital, which, in turn, has struggled over the past few 
years to improve its bottom line. 

In acquiring Digital, Compaq is taking on a complex organization and a markedly 
different corporate culture, industry experts point out. The deal, unanimously 
approved yesterday by both companies' boards, also must pass muster with U.S. 
antitrust regulators and the shareholders of both firms. 

Yet if the merger is a success, the company that emerges will be an even 
stronger partner in the Microsoft-Intel alliance. Both Compaq and Digital were 
committed to supporting Windows NT before this deal, pointed out Nathan 
Myhrvold, Microsoft's chief scientist. 

"DEC has organization and enterprise skills and Compaq has a heritage in the 
mass production world," he said. "NT is a product that straddles those two 
areas," he added, and the new firm will be well suited to propel it forward. 

But corporate customers want more from their suppliers than the latest hardware 
and software; they want a corps of trained specialists who can make all the 
pieces work, and even after acquiring Tandem, Compaq was "nowhere near the 
player that DEC is" in that area, said Gens of IDC. 

With the purchase of Digital, Compaq gains a company that not only is known for 
its server computers, but one that over the years has created a services 
division for large customers that ranks among the top 10 in the world, Gens 
said. Digital has a group of about 25,000 engineers and support staff around the 
world, compared with 8,000 for Compaq. 

Digital's services division "has been a real moneymaker," said Tony Scott of 
A.T. Carney, an executive search organization, in Redwood Shores, Calif. Last 
quarter, for instance, services amounted to $ 1.5 billion of Digital's $ 3.3 
billion in revenue. (For all of 1997, Digital had $ 13 billion in revenue, and $ 
140.8 million in profit.) 

But Compaq inherits more than a strong services group. Digital's researchers are 
known for creating such jewels as AltaVista, a powerful "engine" for searching 
the World Wide Web; the Alpha microprocessor, which routinely outstrips Intel's 
family of Pentium processors; and a promising chip called StrongARM, designed to 
be the brains of handheld electronic devices and possibly even the TV set-top 
boxes that promise to meld TVs and computers. 

Although the technologies are promising, analysts said, many of those efforts 
have seemed to muddy Digital's core business and sap its profitability. 
Recently, Digital agreed to sell its chip businesses to Intel, although the deal 
is still awaiting government approval. Executives said Compaq, after it buys 
Digital, will continue to support Alpha. 

Under terms of the deal, which the companies hope to complete in the second 
quarter, Digital shareholders will receive $ 30 in cash and about 0.945 share of 
Compaq stock for each share of Digital stock they own. Compaq plans to pay $ 4.8 
billion in cash and issue 150 million shares of stock to finance the purchase. 
Based on Compaq's closing price of $ 31.75 Friday, the deal values Digital at 
just more than $ 60 per share, a nearly one-third premium to the company's $ 
45.43 3/4 close Friday. 

Yesterday, Digital stock jumped $ 10, to $ 55.43 3/4, while Compaq fell $ 2.75, 
to $ 29, both in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
