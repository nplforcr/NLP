COLOGNE, Germany, March 24-
 


Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright today urged Russia and four other 
European nations to step up punitive sanctions against Yugoslav President 
Slobodan Milosevic until he shows greater cooperation in defusing the conflict 
in the Serbian province of Kosovo. 

But as she arrived here to prepare for a meeting in Bonn Wednesday to discuss 
what to do about Kosovo, Albright appeared to be waging a lonely campaign to 
persuade others in the six-nation Balkans "contact group" to sustain a tough 
attitude toward the Yugoslav government. 

Only Britain shares the U.S. view that Milosevic, whose rump nation consists of 
Serbia and Montenegro, is more likely to respond to sticks than carrots in 
meeting demands that he withdraw special police units from Kosovo and make a 
serious effort to restore political autonomy to the 2 million Albanians who make 
up 90 percent of Kosovo's population. 

Russia, France, Italy and Germany have expressed varying degrees of satisfaction 
with Milosevic's behavior since the contact group agreed to a series of 
sanctions against Yugoslavia at a meeting in London two weeks ago. 

At that meeting, the group agreed to consider a comprehensive arms embargo 
against Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant republic, a halt to supplying equipment 
that could be used for repression, a denial of visas to Yugoslav officials 
involved in the crackdown and an end to export credits to Belgrade for trade and 
investment. 

Russia, a long-standing ally of the Serbs and their main supplier of weapons, 
has spurned compliance with the comprehensive arms embargo and balked at further 
sanctions against Yugoslavia. Albright held discussions here this evening with 
Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov, but there was no sign that Moscow was 
moving closer toward Washington's views. 

The contact group last met March 9 in the aftermath of a brutal crackdown on 
ethnic Albanians that followed a series of attacks by separatist guerrillas 
against Serbian police in Kosovo. At least 80 people, many of them women and 
children, were killed by Serbian police and paramilitary forces in the 
crackdown. 

The violence has subsided since then, although the province remains tense, 
especially in strongholds of the Kosovo Liberation Army, an Albanian separatist 
guerrilla group. 

On Monday, Serbian and ethnic Albanian leaders signed an agreement that would 
allow Albanian high school and university students to return to state 
classrooms, seven years after Serbian authorities banned their Albanian-language 
curriculum. 

During a six-hour stopover in Rome to consult with Italian Foreign Minister 
Lamberto Dini and Vatican officials, Albright said Serbia's response had not 
been sufficient to ease international pressure. She called on the rest of the 
contact group to maintain sanctions until Yugoslavia complies fully with its 
demands. 

"We have seen too many diplomatic efforts fail to believe that President 
Milosevic will respond to positive pressure alone. And if we give him even a 
shadow of a glimmer of a hint that he has done enough, he will assuredly do no 
more," she said. 

She insisted that Milosevic has stopped far short of doing what is necessary. 
"Serbian security police are digging in, not pulling out; Milosevic has still 
not committed himself to unconditional dialogue; aid workers continue to be 
harassed, and the list goes on." 

In contrast, Dini praised Milosevic for taking some steps in the right direction 
and said there was no reason for the group to be "entirely dissatisfied" with 
Yugoslavia's behavior over the past two weeks. During a visit to Belgrade last 
week, foreign ministers Klaus Kinkel of Germany and Hubert Vedrine of France 
told Milosevic they welcomed "significant progress" he showed toward meeting the 
group's demands. 

U.S. officials said they wanted to "prevent backsliding" toward Yugoslavia. 
"This is not the time to reverse course," a senior administration official said. 
"What we want is to be leading the group to understand that without pressure he 
[Milosevic] will not respond." 

To show U.S. displeasure with Belgrade, Albright said she will sign an order 
barring 16 Yugoslav officials involved in the Kosovo crackdown from entering the 
United States. "We have too much experience in the former Yugoslavia to settle 
for half-sincere half measures," she said. "We will need to maintain credible 
pressure on Belgrade to end repression and restore autonomy" in Kosovo. 

But European allies predict that Milosevic will respond to encouraging gestures 
by taking further steps toward peace. Some European companies want to see 
sanctions lifted so they can take advantage of early investments in Yugoslavia's 
privatization plans, which they believe offer the prospect of easy profits.
