DILI, Indonesia, June 13-
 


More than 1,000 people, including a few aging resistance fighters, gathered at 
the University of East Timor today in this Indonesian-occupied territory for a 
demonstration that was more remarkable for what did not happen. 

Unlike in the past, when Indonesia was ruled by former president Suharto, 
security forces, for the second time this week, did not harass protesters. 
Soldiers were nowhere to be seen around the campus as the demonstrators spoke 
over loudspeakers about their desire for independence. 

"Viva!" they shouted, punching their fists into the air. They gathered on the 
back lawn of the campus and some sat on the school's roof, unfurling banners 
calling for the release of jailed resistance leader Jose Alexandre 'Xanana' 
Gusmao, or proclaiming "Death or independence!" 

"This is a golden chance for us," said Jovensio Martinez, 37, who spent nearly 
seven years in prison after a 1991 street demonstration during which security 
forces shot and killed at least 50 protesters. 

"It's the first chance we get to express our feelings on how to solve our 
problems and decide our political future," he said. "We have been crushed down 
for 23 years." 

Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975 and annexed it the following year. The 
United Nations still recognizes Portugal, East Timor's former colonial ruler, as 
the territory's administrative authority. 

In an interview today with the Japanese news service Kyodo, President B.J. 
Habibie rejected independence for East Timor. "The integration of East Timor was 
accomplished more than 20 years ago with the will of the people themselves, and 
there is no going back now," he said. 

He had previously suggested granting the territory "special status" but the 
Timorese rejected the idea. The students and most of the general population want 
a referendum to determine the region's future. 

Student protests ushered the fall of Suharto, who stepped down last month after 
32 years in power, but that was not until at least four student demonstrators 
were slain by security forces. Massive rioting followed, prompting some of 
Suharto's key allies, including members of the military, to abandon him. 

But it is the military here that wields control, enjoying a certain amount of 
autonomy from the Indonesian government. The governor and local military 
commanders have already warned against demonstrations. Soldiers have refrained 
from trying to prevent campus protests here, but they broke up a demonstration 
Friday by East Timorese at the Foreign Ministry in Jakarta, the Indonesian 
capital. 

It is unclear whether the military is taking a softer line in light of the new 
political reform era in Indonesia, or is just trying to sort itself out after 
Suharto's fall and the deaths of 12 senior regional military commanders in a 
helicopter crash this month. 

The United States suspended most of its military assistance to Indonesia after 
the 1991 killings in Dili, but nonetheless East Timor hardly registers on the 
agenda in Jakarta unless foreign governments bring up the issue. 

Analysts say the next few weeks should indicate how far the student movement in 
East Timor will go, but it appears from today's demonstration that it is 
unlikely the protesters will try to march in the streets or take over 
parliament, as students tried to do in Jakarta. Panic almost erupted during 
today's protest when a truck of soldiers merely drove by. The demonstration was 
held far out of sight of the main road to lessen the chances of a confrontation. 


The climate of fear in East Timor goes much deeper than in Indonesia. Nearly 
every other adult in Dili has been detained or tortured, or knows someone who 
has been, during the past 23 years of Indonesian rule. 

Reports from Lisbon said that authorities today detained prominent activist M'a 
Huno, who had been a commander of separatist forces. 

The military has been trying to root out elements or supporters of the Fretilin 
independence movement, which has been waging an armed struggle against the 
Indonesian occupation. Scattered pockets of resistance remain, but the rebellion 
has lost much of its steam. 

Domingos Maria Alvez, 67, was one of East Timor's first resistance fighters and 
in the 1970s was detained for eight months, tied up in a cave part of the time. 
Alvez attended today's demonstration with his grandson and said he has been 
waiting years for the chance to speak out. 

"I have hope when I see these young people now," he said. "When I see them 
struggling, it gives meaning to my struggle before. I'm already old, but my 
dream would be fulfilled to see the new generation liberated from the 
oppressors."
