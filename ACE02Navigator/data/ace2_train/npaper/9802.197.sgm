AMMAN, Jordan, Feb. 15-
 


Calls for a diplomatic solution to the Iraq crisis bounded around the Middle 
East today as leaders anticipated a still unscheduled mission to Baghdad by U.N. 
Secretary General Kofi Annan. 

A visit by the top U.N. diplomat has come to be regarded throughout the region 
as the world body's last chance to avert airstrikes on Iraq by U.S. and British 
bombers massed in the Persian Gulf region. No one on any side of the issue seems 
to oppose the visit, although opinions diverge on just what it would take to 
defuse the crisis. 

Washington and London are demanding unimpeded access by U.N arms inspectors to 
suspected storage and production sites for chemical and biological weapons in 
Iraq. The Iraqi leadership wants to alter the makeup of the inspection teams and 
limit their access. 

In Baghdad, the government of President Saddam Hussein hosted a three-member 
U.N. map-making team that arrived to survey eight presidential complexes that 
arms inspectors think may be storage or production sites for chemical and 
biological weapons. The Iraqis seemed eager to display cooperation but also to 
indicate that the survey was a limited exercise, designed to lay the groundwork 
for a visit by Annan. 

Iraqi helicopters ferried the U.N. team over the sites, and officials permitted 
ground visits for mapping purposes, Iraqi officials said. The exercise, said 
Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed Sahhaf, is meant to "prepare the 
information about the presidential sites . . . how many acres, are they 
surrounded by fences, to prepare the maps. So when the secretary general 
arrives, he will find precise information. That's all." 

At the same time, Iraq insisted that inspections are unnecessary, saying that 
its biological and chemical weapons, as well as missiles to deliver them, have 
long been eliminated. 

"The facts are that Iraq declared those weapons [to the United Nations], and 
Iraq destroyed them," said Gen. Amir Saadi, an Iraqi presidential adviser. 

Meanwhile, each passing day brings new evidence that the alliance that staunchly 
supported the U.S.-led bombing of Iraq in 1991 and the subsequent freeing of 
Kuwait from Iraqi occupation has disintegrated. Most of the Middle East partners 
in the Persian Gulf War are now pressing for a peaceful outcome of the present 
crisis. 

The defense minister of the United Arab Emirates, Mohammed bin Rashid Maktum, 
said, "We do not agree to attack Iraq" because of possible civilian casualties. 
Saudi Arabia's defense minister, Prince Sultan, reiterated his government's 
refusal to let American planes use Saudi bases to launch air raids. 

Here, Jordanian officials repeatedly expressed hope that bombing will not be 
necessary. Jordan has a complex relationship with Iraq, since it depends on its 
ostracized neighbor for oil supplies. Today, the Jordanians signed a $ 225 
million barter deal with Iraq under which it will trade soap, cooking oil and 
other household goods for fuel. 

Jordan is exempt from U.N. prohibitions on trade with Iraq. The arid kingdom has 
been cut off from its main supplier, Saudi Arabia, since the Gulf War because 
King Hussein did not wholeheartedly condemn Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Iraq also 
offers Jordan more favorable prices than Persian Gulf states that might also be 
willing to fill its fuel needs.
