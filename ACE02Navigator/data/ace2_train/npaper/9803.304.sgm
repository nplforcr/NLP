NEW DELHI, March 12-
 


The likely leadership of India's next government grew more uncertain today after 
the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, which emerged from a midterm 
election with the most seats in the new Parliament, lost support of its biggest 
ally and fell further short of a parliamentary majority. 

The political dispute prompted President K.R. Narayanan, who is empowered to 
appoint the prime minister, to announce he will explore the possibility of an 
alternative coalition government that would merge the two other blocs in 
Parliament. 

Narayanan said he will continue talks with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) even 
as he confers with leaders of the two other blocs -- the once-dominant Congress 
party and the ruling United Front coalition. 

The president is to meet Friday with Sitaram Kesri, outgoing president of the 
Congress party, which controls the second-largest bloc of legislators. Narayanan 
has appointments later in the day separately with former prime minister H.D. 
Deve Gowda, representing the United Front, and two of the ruling coalition's 
communist leaders. 

The day's developments demonstrated how the close division of the new Parliament 
makes it even more unstable than the last one, elected in 1996. The old 
Parliament threw together two governments led by the United Front, a coalition 
of 13 parties whose reign was marked by indecision, infighting and policy drift. 


In this year's staggered voting, the BJP-led bloc -- with a dozen partners, 
almost as many the United Front -- emerged as the top vote-getter with 252 
seats. The biggest ally of the BJP was a regional party from the southern state 
of Tamil Nadu with 18 seats. 

And that party, the All India Dravidian Progressive Federation, has thrown a big 
obstacle into BJP plans to take power as soon as this weekend. 

J. Jayalalitha, the Dravidian party's leader, has declined to submit a formal 
statement of support for a BJP-led government. So when Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the 
BJP's choice to become prime minister, met Narayanan today, he carried written 
commitments from 240 legislators -- 33 short of a majority in the 545-member 
lower house of Parliament. Had Vajpayee brought commitments from a majority of 
the new Parliament's members, Narayanan presumably would have formally invited 
the BJP to form a government. 

Jayalalitha, a former movie star whom her party's members call "Mother," did not 
disclose why she was withholding support. But leaders of the BJP and her party 
said the hangup was a rejection of her nominee as finance minister, Subramaniam 
Swamy, a Harvard-trained mathematician. 

Vajpayee, 71, last year indicated his discomfort with the BJP's alliance with 
Jayalalitha, a former chief minister of Tamil Nadu who was jailed on corruption 
charges after her state government was defeated in the 1996 election. Political 
observers said Vajpayee was personally even more uncomfortable with Swamy, who 
was once a BJP member. 

Vajpayee told reporters that BJP leaders were still talking to Jayalalitha's 
party, but he sounded firm in his stance, saying, "I don't feel any pressure, 
nor will I bow to any pressure." 

The impasse could prove to be a break for Congress and the United Front, which 
have had their own problems sorting out a new alliance. Several partners of the 
United Front have expressed reservations about backing a Congress-led 
government, but if they combined forces, the two blocs would need about 10 more 
supporters to control a majority in Parliament. 

So far Congress and the United Front have not engaged in serious discussions 
about renewing their awkward alliance, under which two United Front governments 
ruled with Congress's backing -- but not its membership in the coalition. They 
had appeared content to watch whether the BJP could pull together a majority 
and, if it could, to let the Hindu nationalist party grapple with the 
difficulties of coalition politics, Indian-style. 

Those troubles surfaced perhaps sooner than the BJP's opponents anticipated. 
V.P. Singh, a former prime minister and driving force behind the United Front, 
used matrimony and a deadly, illegal Indian custom as a metaphor for the 
implications of the dispute between the BJP and Jayalalitha's party. 

"If before a marriage, all terms and conditions are not agreed upon," Singh told 
reporters, "it will lead to bride-burning."
