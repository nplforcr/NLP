To the cheers of hundreds of employees, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt vowed 
yesterday to fight a perjury investigation by an independent counsel and 
predicted "absolute vindication" for himself and his department. 

"The times are out of sync and so is the system," Babbitt told a sympathetic 
audience that greeted him with a standing ovation in Interior's main auditorium. 
He said he has been tempted over the past few months "to say the hell with it. . 
. . I'm going home," but not anymore. 

"I'm here. I'm going to fight this out to the bitter end and we will be 
vindicated," he declared. 

Attorney General Janet Reno asked on Wednesday for appointment of an independent 
counsel to determine whether Babbitt lied to Congress last fall about his 
handling of a proposed Indian gambling casino. 

Tribes opposed to the Hudson, Wis., casino project, which was rejected by 
Interior in July 1995, contributed more than $ 350,000 to Democrats for the 1996 
campaign and launched a full-scale lobbying drive aimed at securing the Interior 
Department's decision. 

Reno's petition is awaiting action by a special panel of three federal judges 
who will name the outside counsel and have the final say on the scope of the 
investigation. It will be the first to grow out of alleged fund-raising abuses 
by the Clinton-Gore reelection effort. 

Babbitt's 15-minute meeting with employees yesterday morning in the 750-seat 
auditorium was billed as an occasion to "address concerns" they might have about 
the investigation and lay out his plans for the coming year "to further enhance 
the administration's environmental and cultural resources agenda." It had some 
of the trappings of a campaign rally, with workers handed red-lettered "FOBB" -- 
Friend of Bruce Babbitt -- stickers to put on their lapels. 

A former Arizona governor and 1988 Democratic presidential contender, Babbitt 
seemed buoyed by the full-house reception, shaking hands as he came down the 
aisle and deftly abandoning a podium with scratchy microphones to begin without 
one at center stage. 

"Well, the Burton committee is doing its work," he quipped when the second mike 
wouldn't work. 

The House Government Reform and Oversight Committee headed by Rep. Dan Burton 
(R-Ind.) recently concluded two weeks of hearings on the casino controversy with 
GOP calls for an independent counsel with a broader mandate than Reno 
recommended. Republicans contend the decision to reject the casino was 
improperly influenced by the prospect of Democratic campaign contributions from 
opposing tribes and by pressures from White House and Democratic Party 
officials. 

Babbitt has repeatedly denied that allegation, saying the decision was made on 
recommendations of career Interior officials unaffected by heavy lobbying on 
both sides of the issue. 

"There is a corrosive, antagonistic, bitter, combative culture which has settled 
over this town," Babbitt said. He said "all the facts" have been made public and 
all the participants have been "interviewed, deposed, harassed [and] testified" 
many times, but his critics refuse to be "swayed by the facts." 

And so, Babbitt said, to rousing applause, "here I am. And here I'm going to 
stay." 

Babbitt's predicament stems from a conversation he had with Paul Eckstein, an 
old friend hired as a lobbyist by pro-casino forces, on July 14, 1995, the day 
the casino application was rejected. Eckstein has testified that when he asked 
for a delay, Babbitt told him that Harold Ickes, then White House deputy chief 
of staff, had called and directed him to make a decision that day. 

Babbitt, when testifying before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee last 
fall, said he did invoke Ickes's name, but only in an "awkward" effort to end 
the meeting. He also said that Ickes had not directed him to make the decision 
that day. 

Reno said Wednesday that Babbitt may have perjured himself or violated the false 
statement statute, but in view of his status as a Cabinet member, only an 
independent counsel could resolve the question. Reno also left open the 
possibility that a wider investigation into allegations of White House influence 
might be needed. 

Encouraged by what he said were constant expressions of support, "in person, on 
street corners, in airports, again and again," Babbitt was nonetheless 
frustrated by the prospect of another inquiry. His lawyer, Lloyd N. Cutler, said 
in a telephone interview that he anticipates appointment of an independent 
counsel in a few days, but he noted that it will probably take a month or two 
before the investigation gets rolling. 

"We are quite confident it will not end up in a proceeding against Bruce," said 
Cutler, who served briefly as President Clinton's White House counsel. "I'm 
afraid we've reached a point where if an independent counsel is even requested, 
there must be something criminal there. That's not true at all." 

On a stoic note, Babbitt told his employees, "Life is not always fair. . . . 
Sometimes you are in an intersection at the wrong time and the wrong place and 
you get broadsided through no fault of your own. . . . The important thing, of 
course, is not to be deterred."
