ANKARA, Turkey, June 18-
 


Turkey sent six F-16 fighter jets to northern Cyprus today in response to 
Greece's brief deployment of fighter jets to southern Cyprus, and warned Athens 
against attempting a military buildup on the divided island. 

As the F-16 deployment was announced, Foreign Minister Ismail Cem said the 
Turkish government will take "all necessary measures" against any Greek plans 
for aggression against Turkey. 

While Greece and the Greek-Cypriot government condemned the move, Turkish Prime 
Minister Mesut Yilmaz, who was in Romania on an official visit, said the 
possibility of war between Turkey and Greece over Cyprus "largely depends on the 
Greek-Cypriot attitude." 

The Turkish fighters flew into the Gecitkale Air Base in northern Cyprus two 
days after four Greek F-16s and a C-130 transport plane landed at the 
Greek-Cypriot Paphos Air Base for a brief stopover, the first known landings of 
Greek aircraft at the base since its completion in January. Three of the six 
Turkish jets reportedly returned to their base near Ankara later today. 

Greek-Cypriot Defense Minister Yiannakis Omirou told reporters the Greek 
aircraft stopover sent a "specific political message. That the [Greek-Greek 
Cypriot] common defense doctrine will exist and continue to develop so long as 
there is Turkish expansionism." 

Turkey condemned the Greek move, calling it an "extremely grave and provocative 
development." Cem accused Athens of developing a strategy to use Cyprus as a 
springboard in the event of an attack on Turkey. 

Under a 1993 defense pact between the internationally recognized Greek-Cypriot 
government and Greece, Athens pledged military support to the Greek Cypriots in 
the event hostilities break out on the Mediterranean island. 

Turkey, which has 30,000 troops in northern Cyprus, has its own defense pact 
with the self-proclaimed Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus -- a nation 
recognized only by Ankara -- under which Turkey pledges responsibility for the 
security of the Turkish-Cypriot sector. 

Britain, which maintains military bases on Cyprus, called for restraint in the 
wake of the fighter-jet deployments, and a Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman in 
turn said Ankara would ask Britain to help reduce tension on the island. Britain 
is Cyprus's former colonial ruler and is named as a guarantor power, along with 
Turkey and Greece, under the 1960 Cypriot constitution. 

Greek-Turkish friction over Cyprus has heightened over the past 1 1/2 years, 
triggering concern in Washington that the heavily militarized island could 
become a flash point for armed conflict between the NATO allies. 

Cyprus has been divided since 1974, when Turkey invaded the northern third of 
the island to support the Turkish-Cypriot minority after a Greek-backed coup. 

This week's confrontation over the use of the Greek air base comes amid rising 
tension over the expected delivery of a Russian S-300 ground-to-air missile 
defense system to southern Cyprus later this year. Ankara has threatened to use 
force to prevent the deployment of the missile system. 

Efforts by the United States and Europe to defuse tension and broker a 
settlement on Cyprus were set back after the European Union decided last 
December to begin membership negotiations with the Greek-Cypriot government and 
at the same time left Turkey off its short list of candidates. 

In the wake of those decisions, Ankara froze political dialogue with the EU and 
Ankara, and the Turkish-Cypriot leadership hardened their position regarding 
Cyprus settlement talks. Turkish-Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash insists that the 
talks be carried out on a state-to-state basis -- which would force official 
recognition of the Turkish-Cypriot entity by the south -- and that President 
Glafcos Clerides withdraw the Cypriot EU membership application. 

Ankara welcomed "relative progress" in Turkish-EU ties made at this week's 
European summit at Cardiff, Wales, but stopped short of calling for a resumption 
of political dialogue. 

Britain, which holds the EU presidency, hailed the Cardiff meeting as a positive 
step toward rapprochement with Ankara, saying that Turkey's membership candidacy 
was clearly acknowledged. 

But a Turkish Foreign Ministry statement criticized the Cardiff meeting for 
reiterating what Ankara considers to be unacceptable EU conditions for Turkey's 
membership to advance. Those conditions are that Turkey improves its human 
rights record and makes progress on solving its disputes with Greece, including 
Aegean territorial disputes as well as the tension over Cyprus. 

Ankara is also seeking the release of EU financial aid for Ankara called for 
under a 1996 customs union agreement but which has been held up by Greece. 

Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitas said he rebuffed a telephone appeal from 
President Clinton during the Cardiff summit to soften the Greek stance toward 
Turkey. "I told President Clinton that this was not possible," he said. 

The United States, concerned that the EU snub could drive Turkey away from the 
West and increase the risk of conflict in the Aegean, has stepped up diplomatic 
efforts aimed at improving Turkish-EU relations. 

Richard Holbrooke, the Clinton administration's special envoy to Cyprus and 
newly nominated ambassador to the United Nations, will visit Athens on Monday, 
State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said in Washington today.
