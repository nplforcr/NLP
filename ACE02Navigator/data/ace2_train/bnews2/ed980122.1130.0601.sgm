 Prostate cancer will kill an estimated forty thousand men this year in the US,

 Al Hinman now reports on a new method that may do a better job.

 Jack Markey got a big surprise when he recently turned seventy-six.

 Well, the discovery of the problem came on my birthday, December twenty-ninth.
<time sec="624.088"/>
 At that time I was passing blood.

<turn speaker="Al_Hinman" spkrtype="male" startTime="626.415" endTime="643.435">
 Doctors discovered cancer in Markey's prostate even though he'd passed his twice a year checkups.
<time sec="632.823"/>
 In fact, today's most widely used and accepted method of screening for prostate cancer, the PSA blood test, failed to give Markey and his urologist early warning.

 The big dilemma is that you can still have prostate cancer and have a normal PSA.

<turn speaker="Al_Hinman" spkrtype="male" startTime="648.404" endTime="670.088">
 But now, researchers believe there may be a better way to predict which men are at greatest risk for prostate cancer and may need closer monitoring.
<time sec="658.619"/>
 Researchers at Harvard University believe measuring levels of an essential human growth hormone, called IGF one, may help predict a man's odds of developing prostate cancer.
</turn>
<turn speaker="spkr_2" spkrtype="female" startTime="670.088" endTime="681.558">
 We found that men in the highest twenty-fifth percentile of IGF one levels appeared to have about four times the risk of developing prostate cancer, compared to men in the lowest twenty-fifth percentile.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Al_Hinman" spkrtype="male" startTime="681.558" endTime="706.109">
 The Harvard researchers say more study's needed before doctors should start measuring IGF one hormone levels to predict prostate cancer risk.
<time sec="690.354"/>
 And, they hope, additional research may also provide a way to prevent prostate cancer by controlling levels of the growth hormone.

 That may prove as easy as cutting the fat in diets or getting more exercise.
