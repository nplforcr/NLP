 A couple of minutes ago, we reported that the big tobacco companies were in Congress today, pushing hard for a national settlement of all the lawsuits against them.
<time sec="816.780"/>
 The settlement would require the tobacco companies to pay a very large sum of money to the government, and they would agree to be more closely regulated. In return, they would get some protection from future lawsuits.
<time sec="828.525"/>
 So tonight, we're going to take A Closer Look at how far the country has come in three and a half years. Do you remember this?

 Raise your right hand. Do you swear that the testimony you're about to give is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.

 I don't believe that nicotine or our products are addictive.

 I believe that nicotine is not addictive.

 And I, too, believe that nicotine is not addictive.

 Every one of these big tobacco executives has moved on or been moved since that day. One has died. The Justice Department is still investigating whether the others perjured themselves.
<time sec="876.489"/>
 Yes, in every imaginable way, times have changed for the tobacco companies. They've been under pressure everywhere. Here is ABC's Deborah Amos.

<turn speaker="Deborah_Amos" spkrtype="female" startTime="887.137" endTime="904.198">
 Americans have come a long way on the tobacco road. The romance is gone now. So is Joe Camel. Smokers are out in the cold, banned in baseball parks, restaurants and even in some bars.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Joseph_Califano" spkrtype="male" startTime="904.198" endTime="910.412">
 In the last couple of years, uh just about every state in the union has strengthened their anti-smoking ordinances.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Deborah_Amos" spkrtype="female" startTime="910.412" endTime="929.606">
 In fact, twenty-eight states have passed some kind of tobacco control measures in the last year alone, raising cigarette taxes, banning billboard ads and vending machine sales, making prisons smoke-free. And for the first time, under age smokers are fined. In some states, they are arrested.

 We have to sell cigarettes to your kids.

 A new attitude towards tobacco and tobacco companies, says Joe Califano.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Joseph_Califano" spkrtype="male" startTime="937.652" endTime="946.249">
 The tobacco companies had, for decades, lied to the American people and exploited the children of the United States.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Deborah_Amos" spkrtype="female" startTime="946.249" endTime="974.560">
 Certainly, concern that children were specifically targeted focused political will.
<time sec="952.269"/>
 And focused attention not only on the health effects of tobacco but, for the first time, on the conduct of the industry itself. Did they lie? Did they manipulate nicotine? Did they intentionally market to children?
<time sec="966.300"/>
 Looking for answers, a cast of powerful characters, the first anti-smoking president ever, aggressive government officials.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Peter_Pringle" spkrtype="male" dialect="non-native" startTime="974.560" endTime="979.305">
 You had to have this confluence of events, and you had to have everybody working together.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Deborah_Amos" spkrtype="female" startTime="979.305" endTime="985.193">
 And most important, whistle blowers, including industry scientist who leaked industry secrets.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Peter_Pringle" spkrtype="male" dialect="non-native" startTime="985.193" endTime="992.367">
 You've got a fantastic pile of evidence against the tobacco companies which forced them to the negotiating table. So the whole thing has changed.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Deborah_Amos" spkrtype="female" startTime="992.367" endTime="1020.398">
 In the end, it was the industry that chose to deal rather than fight. The result, historic state settlements, new regulations, the pending national settlement.
<time sec="1004.398"/>
 Part of that deal, early retirement for this character. But the tobacco companies aren't giving up. They've returned to proven old formulas, betting there's still some romance and big money in tobacco. Deborah Amos, ABC News, New York.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Peter_Jennings" spkrtype="male" startTime="1020.398" endTime="1049.908">
 Enormous money, of course, to be made, what with tobacco sales here and overseas. Which is another reason the tobacco companies want a settlement, so that they can get on with making money in a more predictable environment. 
<time sec="1033.082"/>
 A little earlier, we talked about this today. And it is very rare that a senior tobacco executive talks about it. We talked to it with Steven Parrish, the senior vice president of Philip Morris.
<time sec="1043.837"/>
 Mr. Parrish, if you are genuine about this and you want to keep cigarettes away from children, how do you make money?
</turn>
<turn speaker="Steve_Parrish" spkrtype="male" startTime="1049.908" endTime="1073.924">
 Well, we believe, and I guess the proof will be in pudding, but we believe that there w- a- will be adults in this country, as there are today, who uh will want to smoke and enjoy smoking. And we believe that our business uh will do well. If I'm wrong about that,
<time sec="1064.546"/>
 and the only way that people will ever start smoking is if they start smoking as kids, then so be it, and um uh w- we're prepared to accept that.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Peter_Jennings" spkrtype="male" startTime="1073.924" endTime="1083.602">
 Ben LeBowe, tobacco executive who you know well, said that if you don't have kids coming at the end, in at the beginning, you'll all be out of business in thirty years. Do you agree with him at all?
</turn>
<turn speaker="Steve_Parrish" spkrtype="male" startTime="1083.602" endTime="1093.908">
 Well, I don't agree with him, but I don't know. And I guess we'll just have to wait and see, because we are committed. And the other thing I would say, we are committed to reducing youth smoking and, if we can, to eliminate it.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Peter_Jennings" spkrtype="male" startTime="1093.908" endTime="1104.255">
 Now, you know what your critics say, Mr. Parrish. You guys are so smart in the tobacco industry, and you've given the public such a run around for years that if you like this deal, there's got to be something wrong with it.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Steve_Parrish" spkrtype="male" startTime="1104.255" endTime="1126.352">
 Well, I'm not saying we like this deal. There are a lot of things in this agreement that we don't like. uh But we're prepared to do it. um We've gone on too long fighting and arguing. We accept our responsibility for prolonging that. And we are willing and ready to sit down with people, like we have already done, work with others to try to make this happen. But there's a lot in this agreement that uh that we don't like.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Peter_Jennings" spkrtype="male" startTime="1126.352" endTime="1133.842">
 As you see smoking reduced in America, are you reassured by the fact that you can sell cigarettes in the rest of the world?
</turn>
<turn speaker="Steve_Parrish" spkrtype="male" startTime="1133.842" endTime="1142.322">
 We have a global business. We're the larger largest consumer products company in the world. So of course, we're proud to be a global company and sell our products all around the world.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Peter_Jennings" spkrtype="male" startTime="1142.322" endTime="1143.725">
 Thanks very much, Mr. Parrish.
