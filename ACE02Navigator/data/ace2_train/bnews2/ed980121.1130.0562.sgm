 Most scientists say childhood is the best time to learn a second language. Researchers wanted to know why, so they watched the brain in action. Ann Kellan reports, the differences between young and old are dramatic.

 Learning English for her was a cinch.

 The answers could be fifty, the answer could be thirty and the answer could be forty.

 Take your best answer.

<turn speaker="Ann_Kellan" spkrtype="female" startTime="590.061" endTime="592.263">
 Myla's parents are having a tougher time.

 ea- It's h- hard to learn English after thirty years.

 Why is it generally more difficult for adults to learn a new language?
<time sec="599.260"/>
 Researchers at Sloan Kettering Cancer Center are starting to answer this question.
<time sec="603.321"/>
 Using a machine called a functional MRI, they monitor the brain activity of twelve volunteers who speak more than one language.
<time sec="610.776"/>
 Some learned a second language as children, while others learned in high school or college.

 Anne Merkich, a study volunteer learned to speak Croatian and English as a child.
<time sec="621.742"/>
 She helps demonstrate how the study was conducted. Once the MRI scanner is turned on, she will watch some slides and is told to think about the pictures.

 First in English, then in Croatian.

 I thought, oh, good morning, sun. You know, what a wonderful day we had ah- ahead of us.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Ann_Kellan" spkrtype="female" startTime="637.250" endTime="641.746">
 No matter what language Anne used, the same spot in her brain was active.

<turn speaker="spkr_6" spkrtype="female" startTime="641.746" endTime="649.202">
 Yellow is Croatian, and red is English. And you see in this area, they're completely overlapping.

 That wasn't the case when people learned another language later in life.
<time sec="653.123"/>
 Those who learned a second language as teenagers use a separate area of the brain to process the new language.

 It teaches us that the brain does different things

 The results of this study are already having an impact in the way brain surgeons perform, and, more importantly, prepare for surgery.

<turn speaker="spkr_8" spkrtype="male" startTime="673.549" endTime="681.015">
 These are the areas of activation that are responsible for speech production.

 This bright white area here is where the tumor is.

 Then brain surgeons try to avoid the language centers of the patient's brain when removing the tumor.

 Do you think now is a good time for you to learn a language or do you think you should wait a little longer?

 These students prove it by singing a Japanese song they learned last year.

 Scientists say they still don't know when is the best time to learn a second language.
<time sec="702.786"/>
 They eventually hope to answer that question, by more study on how the brain learns language.
