 Finally, the University of North Carolina basketball forward Antoine
 Jamison and two players each from Kansas and Arizona highlight the
 Associated Press All-America First Team. Jamison, the Atlantic Coast
 Conference Player of the Year was named to the First Team on all but one of
 the three team ballots with three hundred forty eight points. Joining
 Jamison are University of Kansas teammates Raef LaFrance and Paul
 Pierce. Arizona Wildcats Mike Bibbi and Miles Simon round out the top
 five. Bibbi was named PAC ten Conference Player of the Year while LaFrance
 received sixty five First Team votes. And that's sports. I'm Jim Stevenson.
