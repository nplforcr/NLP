 Well, while millions of football fans all over the world are preoccupied
 with the World Cup football finals getting underway in France this June, one
 group in Paris has no interest in it at all. The group calls itself The Cup is
 Full and has been formed for French men and women who want nothing to do
 with any aspect of the tournament which runs from June tenth to July twelfth.
 The group has put together lists of bistros and cafes where owners have
 promised to turn their establishments into football free zones and refuse
 to broadcast any of the sixty-four matches. It is also asking the theaters to remain
 open when France is playing.
 Co-founder Lauren Tereseray says that the group was formed because
 not everyone in France is a football fan, and that everyone cannot afford
 to flee the country during the World Cup.
