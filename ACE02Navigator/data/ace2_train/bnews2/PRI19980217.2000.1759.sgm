 And finally, first clap skates, and now this.
 Apparently a New York-based scientist has come up with a daring
 new accessory for cyclists, wings.
 Inventor Robert Saben concerned with the fact that cyclists are
 such a drag on their bicycles has created an outfit that's
 supposed to make man and machine function more as one.
 Saben's fanciful creation is a tunic that clings tightly to the rider's stomach and
 acts as a support for two triangular wings that extend out from
 the shoulder blades.
