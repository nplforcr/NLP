 Forrest, while the lawyers are working on the legal problem, others are grappling with the snowballing political problem

 of eroding public support. 
<time sec="314.741"/>
 The President's Hollywood friend Harry Thomasson, who's given advice in the past on public relations, spent the night.
<time sec="319.924"/>
 Mickey Kantor, the former Commerce secretary, has been hired on as a lawyer who'll also help sell a positive story.
<time sec="326.006"/>
 Even Harold Ickes, who left after the first term, disappointed he'd not been made chief of staff, is said to be lending a hand on an unpaid basis. And leading this team is none other than the First Lady

 who, during the nineteen ninety-two Gennifer Flowers crisis, took charge so effectively. The first urgent requirement is to shore up the President's support within his own party.
<time sec="346.312"/>
 Prominent Democrats have pointedly not stepped forward to defend Mr. Clinton. In fact, Leon Panetta, his former chief of staff, today called the scandal a crisis for the party 
<time sec="356.557"/>
 and said if the charges are not baseless, it would be better if Vice President Gore became president now.
<time sec="362.026"/>
 Party chairman Roy Romer, in an interview with ABC News, appeared horrified at even being asked to comment on Panetta's advice.
<time sec="369.303"/>
 Would you agree?

<turn speaker="Roy_Romer" spkrtype="male" startTime="370.231" endTime="381.231">
 I think it's absolutely inappropriate t- t- ta- to ask and answer speculative questions like that. 
<time sec="375.843"/>
 You know, it doesn't help us solve the problems. I just think it's a question that ought not be asked or answered.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Sam_Donaldson" spkrtype="male" startTime="381.231" endTime="383.271">
 Governor, how do you personally feel about this?
</turn>
<turn speaker="Roy_Romer" spkrtype="male" startTime="383.271" endTime="395.965">
 Well, I tell you. uh I believe that this man is telling the truth. I don't know any of the details around this, but I I know he has been uh 
<time sec="392.924"/>
 beleaguered by attacks since he has been president.

<turn speaker="Sam_Donaldson" spkrtype="male" startTime="395.965" endTime="420.843">
 This afternoon, Vice President Gore came into the White House to confer with the President, but not about this, it was said. Along with other national security officials, 
<time sec="404.414"/>
 Gore attended a full scale meeting on another crisis, the one in Iraq.
<time sec="409.026"/>
 Some stories suggest that the White House is now paralyzed with this scandal. It certainly is demoralized. But at the moment, the important business of considering the next move on Iraq is continuing. Forrest?

<turn speaker="Forrest_Sawyer" spkrtype="male" startTime="420.843" endTime="437.557">
 Sam Donaldson at the White House. Thank you, Sam. Now, another point of view. Joining us,

 former Clinton advisor now ABC News political ana- analyst, George Stephanopoulos. And George, quite clearly, the President and his advisors are deeply involved with trying to stem the 
<time sec="434.026"/>
 the bleeding from this crisis. Are they able to look at other business at all?
</turn>
<turn speaker="George_Stephanopoulos" spkrtype="male" startTime="437.557" endTime="462.006">
 Boy, not too much, Forrest. You know, the State of the Union is scheduled. It's getting written, it has to be given.
<time sec="442.475"/>
 But for the most part, everyone else is walking around wondering is their work going to be relevant 
<time sec="447.761"/>
 in the future. So they watch TV and read the newspapers like everyone else, waiting for the other details. 
<time sec="452.741"/>
 With one big exception. The world doesn't stop, so national security has to go on. And that's why the secretaries of state, defense, the vice president today were meeting on Iraq.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Forrest_Sawyer" spkrtype="male" startTime="462.006" endTime="473.639">
 A lot of people have been questioning how this crisis and how the problems the President is facing might affect his decision making in other areas, most particularly
<time sec="469.863"/>
 the question of Iraq and the growing confrontation between the two countries.
</turn>
<turn speaker="George_Stephanopoulos" spkrtype="male" startTime="473.639" endTime="499.496">
 Well, yeah. Remember, Forrest, this recent movie, Wag The Dog, where a president uh goes to war in order to cover up a scandal.
<time sec="480.945"/>
 um That clearly will not happen here, and the situation with Iraq has been building up for an awful long time. But I think in this case, art actually makes it more difficult for the President to do what he needs to do.
<time sec="492.373"/>
 He'll be sensitive to the criticism that he is taking this action to avoid uh the problems here at home.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Forrest_Sawyer" spkrtype="male" startTime="499.496" endTime="516.128">
 ABC News political analyst George Stephanopoulos. Thank you, George. Of course, as George mentions, not only
<time sec="504.577"/>
 Americans are watching this crisis unfold. Much of the world is paying close attention and, as you can imagine, nowhere more closely than in Iraq. Here's ABC's Mike Lee.
