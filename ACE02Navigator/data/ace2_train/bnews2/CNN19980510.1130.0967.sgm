 What's the best way to get from New York to Washington, train or plane?
 Stephanie Oswald considers the options in today's working ahead.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="977.673" endTime="981.864">
 Honoring Metroliner tickets only.

 The northeast corridor handles more than half of Amtrak's passengers.
 Most are business travelers.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="987.872" endTime="990.036">
 The train is a little less expensive.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="990.036" endTime="1009.495">
 The cost of a walkup train fare from Washington DC to New York is one hundred twelve
 dollars one way.
 Both Delta and US Airways offer shuttle service for the same route.
 Airline walkup fares average just over two hundred dollars one way.
 Comfort and convenience also are bringing more business travelers to ride
 the rails.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1009.495" endTime="1020.750">
 It is a much more comfortable ride.
 It's a better work environment when I want to get some work done, um, and it's
 just a- a little bit more relaxing overall.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1020.750" endTime="1028.397">
 Our stations are in center city so you are traveling center city to
 center city. You don't have a forty-five minute cab ride to worry about.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1028.397" endTime="1043.523">
 But even with the added time of a taxi ride, some still prefer wings to
 wheels.
 Travel time on Amtrak from Washington to New York is about three hours.
 But the same trip on the airline shuttle takes about one hour.
 That's the biggest draw for many fliers.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1043.523" endTime="1049.290">
 For the speed, the convenience.
 I left Greensboro this morning. I'll be back this afternoon.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1050.635" endTime="1055.834">
 Shuttles are different from regular air service.
 They're geared specifically toward business travelers.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1055.834" endTime="1067.410">
 uh We have four inches more leg room than uh regular main line services. It's
 all leather seating.
 And we do serve, it's really the only Delta service that has uh a food service
 on every flight.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1067.410" endTime="1076.738">
 It's one of the few places where the airlines actually have uh aircraft on
 reserve so if one aircraft fills up, they just pull in another one and load
 up people and take off.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1076.738" endTime="1084.355">
 Both the airline shuttles and the train offer more than a dozen hourly
 departures every day.
 Leaving the traveler with plenty of options.
