 Well, time now for today's geography quiz.
 Like President Clinton, we're in South Africa today.
 Unlike the President, we're not in Cape Town, but in a corner of
 the country that is forever French.
 In fact the name of our mystery destination, translated from
 Afrikaans, is French Corner.
 This wine producing village grew prosperous from the vines planted
 here by Protestant refugees from France three hundred years ago, but
 every sunlit spot must cast its shadow, no?
 So the French grew rich by using slaves to help them cultivate these vines.
 Think it over.
 We'll answer today's geography quiz in a few minutes.
