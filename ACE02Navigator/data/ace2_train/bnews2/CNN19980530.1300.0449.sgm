 Hundreds of people in Springfield, Oregon, are remembering William and
 Faith Kinkel.
 They turned out for a memorial service last night.
 The Kinkels were allegedly shot to death by their fifteen year old son Kip, who
 is also accused of killing two classmates and wounding twenty-two people at his
 high school.
 His sister, twenty-one year old Kristin Kinkel, says she wants people to remember
 how good her parents were.
 Kip Kinkel is being held at a juvenile detention facility, but
 he has been charged as an adult.
