 Indonesia's new President, BJ Habibie has toured shopping areas of Jakarta
 that were destroyed during anti-government rioting two weeks ago.
 The President urged merchants who lost everything in recent riots to be
 calm and to rebuild.
 He also said the government will help.
 Thousands of protesters vented their anger at the state of Indonesia's
 economy two weeks ago by burning and looting shops owned by ethnic Chinese.
 Scores of people, many of them looters died in the violence.
 The government today released two prominent political prisoners who were
 granted an unconditional amnesty by President Habibie.
 However as VOA correspondent Gary Thomas reports from Jakarta, one of the men
 still wants Mr. Habibie to step down to wa- to make way for a new interim government.

 Labor activist Muchtar Pakpahan and dissident politician Sri Bintang
 Pamungkas were released from Sinpinang jail in the predawn hours Tuesday.
 The release came at the hands of President BJ Habibie who became President
 last week when President Suharto abruptly bowed to public pressure and resigned.
 Mr. Bintang had been in prison for insulting President Suharto during a speech
 in Germany in nineteen ninety-six.
 Mr. Pakpahan was serving a four year jail term for allegedly inciting labor unrest.
 It was the first such release by the Habibie government which has pledged to
 institute more political reforms, including the release of additional political
 prisoners.
 The government has also promised new elections.
 In a meeting with a small group of reporters at his east Jakarta home
 Tuesday, Mr. Pakpahan said although he is grateful for his release, President
 Habibie should step down to make way for another interim government less tied to
 Mr. Suharto.
 He said Mr. Habibie should call a special session of the people's consultative
 assembly next month to elect a new transitional government, or he warned, there would be
 fresh demonstrations.

<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="512.023" endTime="549.046">
 If, uh, Habibie will not, uh, hold, will not agree to hold general assembly next
 month or, uh, next term, yeah.
 It is mean that he against the people need, the people interest.
 And it is mean will trigger the big demonstration again, next month or next week.
 If he will not give his positive direction to the statement, yeah
 we will continue to organize the demonstration.
 You know demonstration is our, our
 to insist him, to force him.

 Mr. Pakpahan said reform is rolling and nothing can stop it.
 He said he hopes change will come peacefully but that a recurrence of the street
 demonstrations may become necessary if the government balks at true and
 total reform.

<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="563.193" endTime="595.188">
 I always organize my activity depend on our opinion and our aim.
 Now my aim is to build the change, to reform the system.
 Okay, of course, we pray for the choice, uh, to bring the reformation
 peacefully, gradually, but if the current
 against us, no another choice, better
 me go back to jail, then I am free, but I cannot do anything.
 It is my principle.

 Mr. Pakpahan said the assembly should change electoral laws so that more
 than just the three officially recognized political parties are allowed.
 He also said the law allowing the President to appoint members of the
 assembly should be abolished so that all assembly members are elected.
 Mr. Pakpahan said he is and will remain a trade unionist and has no plans
 to enter electoral politics, even when reforms are implemented.
 He said he must remain a voice for change.
