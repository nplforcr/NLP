 Time now for our geography quiz today. We're traveling down the Volga river
 to a city that, like many Russian cities, has had several names. But this one
 stands out as the scene of an epic battle in world war two in which the
 Nazis were annihilated. Its streets are still filled with huge, and some would
 say ugly, memorials to the action. This place had a special significance at
 that time. It carried the name of a communist dictator. Two decades earlier it
 was called Tsaritsyn. And two decades later, it changed its name again. That's
 the answer we're looking for, the current name of this historic Russian city
 on the banks of the Volga river. We'll solve today's puzzler in just a few
 minutes.
