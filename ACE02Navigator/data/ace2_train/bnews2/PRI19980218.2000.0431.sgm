 This is The World.
 I'm Eddie Mair in London.

 And I'm Lisa Mullins in Boston.
 As Kofi Annan prepares for his last-ditch try for a diplomatic
 solution to the Iraqi crisis, he's getting good wishes and
 warnings from US officials.
 The UN secretary general departs this weekend for Baghdad to
 meet with Iraq's president Saddam Hussein.
 A White House spokesman says there's been no indication from
 Iraq that would lead anyone to be optimistic about the trip,
 but, he continued, it is important to make this effort.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="458.678" endTime="482.389">
 Even Annan admits he has a difficult mission.
 US and British officials have cautioned that they won't
 accept any settlement short of complete, unfettered access to
 all suspected weapons sites in Iraq.
 Joseph Nye, dean of the Kennedy School of Government at
 Harvard, puts the secretary general's chance of success at less
 than even.
 But he does envision a scenario for a short term diplomatic
 solution.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="482.389" endTime="508.051">
 It's conceivable that if Saddam believes that the punishment
 that he would a- absorb from the military strike can be avoided
 and that he can reap the gains of diplomatic support and
 domestic support while avoiding the punishment, he just might
 feel that it's worth acceding to what Kofi Annan would ah put
 forward and then uh play the whole game again in six months or a
 year from now.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="508.051" endTime="512.499">
 Do you think Kofi Annan is going to have to offer him
 something?
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="512.499" endTime="541.223">
 I think Kofi Annan has to he may be able to offer him
 some cosmetic things like adding additional groups or or nations
 to the inspector teams and so forth, but he can't, I believe,
 accept uh Saddam's desire to exclude large areas as he now uh is
 excluding from inspection or to have what you might call rigged
 inspections in which you have teams without technical skills.
 So I think those are going to be the parameters within which he
 has to work.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="541.223" endTime="549.658">
 All of this comes as the UN announces it's pulling out
 humanitarian personnel from Baghdad.
 It sounds like they're preparing for a strike, doesn't it?
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="549.658" endTime="578.707">
 Well, I think as I said, I think the chances are are better
 that even that Saddam will not cave in at the last minute and
 that there would be a strike.
 But uh it's certainly important for Kofi Annan to go to Baghdad
 and see if he can get the UN inspections back in because
 that's probably the uh one of the best ways to keep Saddam's weapons
 of mass destruction programs under control.
 And if we have a strike and lose the inspection system, we're
 not the better off for it, we're the worse off for it.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="578.707" endTime="582.368">
 How do you rate Kofi Annan as a negotiator?
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="582.368" endTime="595.241">
 I think uh Kofi Annan is a extremely skillful negotiator.
 I think he's been an excellent uh secretary general.
 I think what he's doing now is what a secretary general should
 do, but he's got a very narrow window to work in.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="595.241" endTime="600.173">
 Will he have enough respect in Baghdad, or will they see him
 as an American puppet?
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="600.173" endTime="638.733">
 Well, I think they're, they have to uh see him as the, the best
 interlocutor they're going to get.
 He has to, obviously, steer his way through a security council
 where there're some divisions among the major powers, and uh they
 will hope that they can play on that uh division.
 But uh Kofi Annan has at the same time to realize that if he loses
 support of any of the five major powers, his mission will not
 have been successful.
 So Baghdad'll try to put Kofi Annan in an awkward situation,
 and, and Kofi is going to have to see whether he can negotiate
 something in the narrow constraints that would meet approval of
 the security council.
