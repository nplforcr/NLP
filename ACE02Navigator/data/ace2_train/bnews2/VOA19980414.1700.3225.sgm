 inter Milan defeated Spartak Moscow of Russia two to one and Lazio of
 Rome has played Athletico Madrid of Spain to a scoreless draw to qualify for an all
 Italian Nueva cup final next month. Lazio relied on defense, defense to reach
 their first ever European football final in a tense and scrappy match that
 was played at Rome's Olympic stadium. The draw gave the Romans a one nothing aggregate
 victory after its first leg one nothing road win. Meanwhile, Brazilian football star
 Renaldo scored both goals in inter Milan's two to one victory over Spartak Moscow
 to lead the team to the finals for the second year in a row. The second leg win allowed
 Inter to advance on a four to two aggregate score after winning the fist leg match
 in Milan two weeks ago by an identical two to one score.
