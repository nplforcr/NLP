 Okay, thanks very much. Bob Sheets, nice to see you again under these circumstances.
<time sec="294.517"/>
 Now, we're going to go west because over New Mexico today, another attempt at glory ended in failure. 
<time sec="300.420"/>
 Getting around the world in a balloon must be extremely difficult. No one has been able to do it, and many have tried. 
<time sec="306.744"/>
 The latest attempt by Dick Rutan and Dave Melton began only this morning, 
<time sec="311.387"/>
 and it didn't last very long. Here's ABC's Lisa Salters.

 Not the way veteran pilot Dick Rutan thought his highly anticipated million dollar balloon ride around the world would end. 
<time sec="323.130"/>
 Forced to abandon ship twelve thousand feet in the air only a few hours into his quest to make history.

 You know, just a while ago, we're on our way around the world, and now I'm e- standing in a field with a cactus in my face.

 Rutan and co-pilot Dave Melton boarded their balloon, the Global Hilton, shortly before dawn. 
<time sec="339.916"/>
 The launch went smoothly. The craft slowly rose and disappeared out of sight. 
<time sec="344.517"/>
 Onboard, the two balloonists thought what was supposed to be an adventurous two week journey was just beginning.
<time sec="350.420"/>
 But less than an hour later, something went wrong.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Dick_Rutan" spkrtype="male" startTime="353.361" endTime="363.971">
 As the sun came up, we started to get some heating in the in the capsule, and it started to ascend very nice,
<time sec="358.109"/>
 very slowly. And then we just heard a boom and looked up, and the whole bottom of the bal- balloon had blown out. 
</turn>
<turn speaker="Lisa_Salters" spkrtype="female" startTime="363.971" endTime="389.370">
 The unique craft that was supposed to allow Rutan to make it around the world was designed as a balloon within a balloon with a helium center.
<time sec="371.534"/>
 But that center ruptured without warning and started to leak at twenty-seven thousand feet, forty miles from where the flight began.
<time sec="378.992"/>
 Because winds were gusting, the pilots weren't able to land the balloon, and with four thousand pounds of potentially explosive fuel onboard, they had only one option left.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Dick_Rutan" spkrtype="male" startTime="389.370" endTime="396.660">
 Dave and I just looked at each other, and we both knew what the answer was. It's a lot better to d- land in a parachute in twenty-five knot wind than to try to land in that thing.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Lisa_Salters" spkrtype="female" startTime="396.660" endTime="425.378">
 Rutan suffered only cuts and bruises. Melton dislocated his hip and had to be medivaced to a local hospital.
<time sec="403.172"/>
 What will happen to the balloon is a different story. The unmanned craft started to descend but rose again to thirty thousand feet 
<time sec="410.924"/>
 and is heading east at close to ninety miles an hour, still fully loaded with fuel. Once the sun sets and temperatures drop, Rutan hopes the balloon will fall to earth by itself. Lisa Salters, ABC News, Albuquerque.
