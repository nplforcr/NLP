 Former savings and loan chief, Charles Keating, is facing more legal
 troubles in California.
 A federal appeals court has reinstated his state convictions
 for securities fraud.
 NPR's Elaine Corey has more from San Francisco.

 In nineteen ninety-one Charles Keating was convicted in state court of
 helping to defraud thousands of investors who bought high risk
 junk bonds sold by Keating's employees at Lincoln savings and
 loan.
 The bonds became worthless when the bankrupt thrift was seized
 by government regulators.
 Keating's convictions were thrown out in nineteen ninety-six on a
 technicality.
 And on that basis Keating was released from prison before he
 was eligible for parole.
 Now the ninth US circuit court of appeals has ruled that
 the original appeal was flawed since it brought up issues that
 had not been raised before.
 That means the convictions stand, a ruling likely to send
 Keating's lawyers back to state court where they must start
 over with a new appeal.
