 This is the world. I'm Eddie Mair.

 And I'm Lisa Mullins. One hundred fifty years ago today, a document was published that
 was to change the political face of the world. The Communist Manifesto,
 written by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, inspired revolutions
 across the globe. Lenin read it. So did Mao Tse-tung and Ho Chi Minh. At
 one stage, a third of the world's population lived under communist governments. But
 now the great Marxist experiment appears to be in ruins. The collapse of
 the Soviet Union brought down a host of communist regimes, and few nations
 these days aspire to anything other than a thriving capitalist economy.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1351.341" endTime="1372.801">
 But Marxism is not dead. To discuss how the ideas of the Communist
 Manifesto are interpreted these days, we turn to Alexei Pushkoff, political
 columnist with The Independent in Moscow, and Richard Sakwa, professor of Russian
 politics at Kent University here in Britain. According to Sakwa,
 the Communist Manifesto still communicates revolutionary fervor.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1372.801" endTime="1399.439">
 It's a phenomenally powerful message Marx is putting forwards, the idea that
 the last revolutionary class will put an end to exploitation entirely, and
 it's this vision of human emancipation ultimately which is more important
 than even his ideas about political economy and all the other things. But yet,
 despite his enormous faults, he still had this message of human
 emancipation, and it's this which gave Marx and Marxism its power over the years.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1399.439" endTime="1407.611">
 What is the central message of the Manifesto? Most people can quote a line
 or two from it, but if you were to identify the central thrust, what is it?
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1407.611" endTime="1429.439">
 The opening lines of the Communist Manifesto, which talks about the
 emergence of communism as a organized force, the history of all the hitherto
 existing societies, he says, is the history of class struggles, and so on.
 The idea of huge capital, all you have to do, Marx would say, is to get rid
 of a few capitalists and then people could take over and manage their lives
 themselves.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1429.439" endTime="1444.240">
 Alexei Pushkoff, w- when you look at marxism in practice, you look at China
 branching out now as a free market economy, you look at Cuba, looking for
 outside investors, and of course the collapse of the Soviet Union. Should
 we conclude that marxism has failed?
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1444.240" endTime="1503.494">
 Well, I think marxism has definitely failed as a political experiment and
 as a social experiment, but marxism has not failed as a social theory and uh as a
 a way of thinking because marxism, to my mind, if we take th- the general mythology
 of marxism, which is much more primitive than his theories, w- what it basically says
 is that the capitalist society is not just,
 that there should be a better society, and that there are certain ways by
 which the capitalist society can be changed into a better society. I think
 this idea is still very popular not only in the third world but also e- even
 in Western European countries. So I think that Marx has not failed as a way of
 thinking, as a theory which pictures the alternative to the existing
 society, with which many people will always be unhappy. And in this way, I think we
 will carry Marx with us well into the twenty-first century.

<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1503.494" endTime="1522.748">
 The New Yorker Magazine recently pronounced the world's next big thinker
 to be Karl Marx. They argue that he was way ahead in his views on
 globalization, that he predicted that economics and not politics would be the driving
 force in the future. Was Marx just a man ahead of his time, Alexei Pushkoff?
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1522.748" endTime="1592.170">
 Well, I think that Marx was both very much rooted in his time, and of
 course he was a visionary at the same time. I think th- this very combination makes
 his message so strong. I guess h- he was actually looking into the future, which
 was supposed to be very far ahead. I would say over th- the uh experience which
 Russia, for instance, had. He was looking in the twenty-second century. You know, he was
 bypassing all such small details for him as the practical organization of a, of a
 communist society. We have experienced this practical organization, we know
 what it is, we know that uh bureaucracy has become the main driving force uh of
 the society, w- we know that terror has uh become one of the main instruments of
 controlling the people, but when it comes to realities, I think that Marx was uh
 much more wrong than right.
 He never understood uh that even when economic forces
 dominate the general flow of human development, there is still place for an
 individual, there is still place for civil rights, there is still place
 for a personality.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1592.170" endTime="1603.662">
 Richard Sakwa, is it possible that perhaps in a hundred and fifty years' time,
 maybe sooner, uh my successor will be sitting asking your successor about what an
 enormous success Marx has been in practice?
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1603.662" endTime="1641.467">
 I- I doubt it very much. It's a good question. I wonder though, sometimes,
 whether in a hundred and fifty or two hundred years, whether, when the
 question is asked, they'd say, Marx, who was he? Some, perhaps not a
 utopian thinker, certainly an important social thinker of the mid nineteenth
 century whose ideas were taken up in uh certain peripheral countries, the third world,
 uh Russia, uh eastern Europe, in a different way, China, but he forgot the
 politics, he forgot that people are involved in it, so, quite clearly, it
 doesn't have much to say about the relationship between the markets and
 politics. He tended to reduce politics to economics, and that was quite
 false.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1641.467" endTime="1653.53">
 Thank you both for helping us mark the anniversary. Richard Sakwa,
 professor of Russian and European politics at Kent University in England, and Alexei
 Pushkoff, political columnist at The Independent newspaper in Moscow.
 Many thanks to you both.
