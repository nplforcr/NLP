 Amnesty International, the human rights group, is urging the UN human
 rights commission to take a tough stance against nations that violate the
 human rights of their citizens. Amnesty International is urging the
 commission to focus on six countries. Lisa Schlein has the story in Geneva.

 Amnesty International has singled out Algeria, Cambodia, Colombia, Kenya,
 Saudi Arabia, and Turkey, for special attention. It says these countries
 are guilty of a pattern of systematic, persistent, and severe human rights
 violations.
 The human rights group is especially critical of Algeria. It says it will
 demand international action to end six years of what it calls human rights
 atrocities in Algeria. Amnesty's director of legal affairs, Nicholas Howen,
 says about eighty thousand people have been killed since the start of the Algerian
 conflict.

 And in the essence of what is happening in Algeria is the impunity, that no one
 is brought to justice for what is happening, and so it continues. There is no
 other country in the world where the human rights violations are so
 extreme, but where there has been no international scrutiny, let alone action. No
 resolutions, no visits by experts. Nothing.

 Mr. Howen also says there must be an investigation into the killings of
 ethnic Albanians in the Serbian province of Kosovo. He says there's strong
 reason to believe that many of the people, including women and children, were
 victims of extra-judicial killings carried out by Serb soldiers.

 The office of the High Commission for Human Rights in Belgrade must
 urgently carry out an investigation in Kosovo province, be given full access, and be
 backed up by forensic experts. And most importantly, they must report to
 the Commission during the Commission. Because then it is the responsibility of
 the Commission to say what its nex- next action should be.

 Mr. Howen sharply criticized the European Union's decision not to support
 any Commission resolution on China's human rights record. He says the EU
 action has already cast a shadow over the work of the Commission.
 He says the decision has more to do with policy splits between EU member
 states, and with lucrative markets, than with any real improvement in
 China's human rights situation.
