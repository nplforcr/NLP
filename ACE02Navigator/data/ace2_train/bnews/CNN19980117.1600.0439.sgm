 Iraqi president Saddam Hussein is warning the united states not to take
 military action against his country.
 In a televised speech, Hussein said Iraq is determined to launch a holy war
 unless UN sanctions are lifted.
 If that demand isn't met, he is hinting Iraq may stop cooperating with UN
 weapons inspections and impose a six month deadline for them to be
 completed.
 Hussein's speech came on the seventh anniversary of the gulf war.
 Demonstrators marked it by burning US, British and Israeli flags outside
 the united nations office in Baghdad.
