 There's a small group of people who like eating the same foods as most of
 us, minus the preparation.
 Jeanne Moos has more on the raw foodists.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1498.340" endTime="1502.847">
 Peel off those potholders.
 Stifle the stove.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1502.847" endTime="1505.527">
 I've been raw now for about three years.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1505.527" endTime="1509.149">
 And nothing feels as good as being a hundred percent raw.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1509.149" endTime="1518.235">
 She is a raw foodist, not to be confused with a nudist, who eats in the
 raw.
 No, a raw foodist is someone who eats raw rather than cooked food.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1518.235" endTime="1522.605">
 ...left and they're hearing raw food for the first time and think, what is
 this, the food's going to jump off of the plate?
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1522.605" endTime="1523.750">
 So what's for dinner?
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1523.750" endTime="1525.735">
 What's not cooking?
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1525.735" endTime="1554.485">
 Little ID tags help.
 Mock tuna, for instance, consists of soaked walnuts, carrots and herbs.
 Mock mashed potatoes are actually mashed cauliflower.
 And mock lasagna is really ground almonds with tomato sauce made in a
 blender.
 Out with the oven, in with the cuisinart.
 Raw foodists say, expect way more energy.
 They claim raw is better, because cooking kills enzymes that aid
 digestion.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1554.485" endTime="1561.239">
 We're the only species on the planet that is cooking our food.
 I mean, the birds don't cook.
 The bees don't cook.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1561.239" endTime="1573.288">
 Mainstream nutritionists say that argument is for the birds, that our
 bodies provide all the enzymes necessary for digestion, and that raw
 foodists are giving up a balanced diet.
 What's left to give up?
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1573.288" endTime="1576.838">
 Some people are fruitarians.
 Some people eat only fruit.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1576.838" endTime="1579.664">
 And some people supposedly don't eat any food.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1579.664" endTime="1580.998">
 Breathatarian.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1580.998" endTime="1583.025">
 They get nutrition from the air?
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1583.025" endTime="1586.218">
 Well, I saw a picture, and the person looked like a toothpick.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1586.218" endTime="1595.494">
 There were few if any heavyweights at this potluck dinner thrown by a raw
 foodist who goes by the name Rhio.
 Rhio is writing a raw food recipe book.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1595.494" endTime="1596.838">
 An un-cookbook.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1596.838" endTime="1604.548">
 Featuring dishes ranging from unbaked beans to nutloaf.
 Even Rhio's cats are raw foodists.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1604.548" endTime="1610.095">
 That's an organic raw chicken leg.
 Not everyone at the potluck felt lucky afterwards.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1610.095" endTime="1611.534">
 I'm still hungry.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1611.534" endTime="1634.716">
 But raw food can be as American as apple pie, raw apple pie made with a
 crust of ground walnuts and dates, unbaked here at a restaurant called Eight
 Beach Street.
 The pie was great, but the fishless sushi was hard to swallow.
 After eight months serving mostly raw food, restaurant owner Rune
 Kongshaug concluded,
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1634.716" endTime="1636.922">
 That New York is not quite ready yet.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1636.922" endTime="1638.277">
 We figured as much.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1638.277" endTime="1641.775">
 uh-oh
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1639.034" endTime="1641.775">
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1641.775" endTime="1656.00">
 They're cooking more and more menu items.
 And, heaven forbid, a stove is on order.
 And don't let proximity to the menu fool you.
 You're not supposed to dig into the plants with a knife and fork.
 Jeanne Moos, CNN, New York.
