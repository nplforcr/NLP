 The Pentagon said today it will re-examine the question are the remains inside the Tomb of the Unknown from the Vietnam War, in fact, known?
<time sec="465.305">
 CBS News first reported last night that the tomb may contain the remains of Air Force pilot Michael Blassie.
<time sec="471.734">
 There was a suspicion the body was Blassie because his uniform and ID card were found near the body in Vietnam. But subsequently, they were lost. Blassie's mother now wants the remains in the tomb tested for DNA.

 It's a beautiful place to be and it's a great honor to be there, but not if you're known, not if it's your son.

 A decision whether to exhume the body could take months.
