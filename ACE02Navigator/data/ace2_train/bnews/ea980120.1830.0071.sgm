 Good evening from the central park in downtown Havana. We are here this week to witness the rendezvous that Fidel Castro and the Pope are having with history.

<time sec="177.019">
 This is quite an extraordinary story unfolding here. We'll come back to Havana later in the broadcast.
<time sec="182.754">
 But now we're going to go back to New York, where Diane Sawyer has the rest of the news. Diane?
