 A Massachusetts state trooper is demanding an apology from one of the attorneys who
 until yesterday represented British au pair, Louise Woodward.
 Brian Jenkins has the story.

 Elaine Whitfield Sharp stood beside Louise Woodward when a jury found the
 twenty year old au pair guilty of murdering the baby boy in her care.
 And when the trial judge reduced the conviction to involuntary
 manslaughter, letting Woodward out of prison, but not out of Massachusetts
 pending appeals, Sharp took Woodward into her home, near Boston.

 It's a distressing situation for a young person who's as intelligent as Louise and
 wants to move on with her life.

 The situation may have been distressing for Sharp as well.
 A Massachusetts state trooper claims she made a startling revelation after
 he pulled her over May twenty-second on suspicion of drunk driving.

<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="623.425" endTime="647.896">
 Ms. Sharp stated to me that she was an attorney for, uh, Louise Woodward and
 when she took the case, she believed that she was innocent.
 And she now knows that she is guilty and i- is having a hard time handling it.
 Ms. Sharp has apparently accused me of offering, offering to release her
 in in exchange for sex, which would be a crime.
 And fondling her breasts, which would be another crime.

 Cipoletta says he may sue Sharp for defamation.
 Meanwhile, Woodward's three other lawyers announced the dismissal of Sharp
 from their team, saying she has shown, at times, an aberrant pattern of behavior.
 In a written statement they said we do not believe that trooper Cipoletta is an
 extortionist and a liar anymore than we believe that Ms. Woodward is
 a murderer and a liar.
 Woodward moved out of Sharp's home at the end of March.
 Neither she nor her former attorney are making any public comments.
 The remaining lawyers say Woodward's done nothing to change the opinion of
 anyone who believed in her innocence.
