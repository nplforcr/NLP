 Radon is a natural radioactive gas that can seep from the earth into your
 home.
 A study by the national research council says radon is linked to nearly
 twenty-two thousand lung cancer deaths a year in the United States.
 And most of the victims are smokers.

 Smokers who are exposed to radon appear to be at greater risk for
 developing lung cancer,
 because the effects of smoking and radon are more powerful when the
 two factors are combined.

 Radon is everywhere.
 The Environmental Protection Agency plotted its different concentrations
 across the United States.
 The EPA recommends home owners test for high levels of radon gas and take
 measures, such as fixing cracks in the basement, to help block that natural
 seepage and reduce the risk to your health.
 For your health, Hannah Buchdahl, CNN Headline News.
