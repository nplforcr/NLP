 Today in Geneva, hundreds of children from Africa, Asia, and
 Latin America descended on the headquarters of the International Labor
 Organization to protest the exploitation of child labor. The demonstration
 was the climax of a six month global campaign against child labor
 practices. It also coincides with the ILO's annual conference, which
 hopes to come up with new legislation to abolish the worst forms of child
 labor worldwide. As Clair Dual reports from Geneva, the protests are an
 attempt to get governments to take action against child labor.

 These seven year olds are scavenging for coal in a mine near the Colombian
 capital, Bogota. The poorest of the poor, they survive by selling the coal
 to middlemen. The ILO estimates two hundred and fifty million such children work in
 developing countries, with particularly high numbers in Asia and Latin
 America.

 Global March organizer Kylash Satiati, says both developed and
 developing countries have long ignored the problem of child labor.

 There is a serious lack of political will right from the countries up to
 the international level. So it was necessary to mobilize the whole world
 against the menace of child labor.

 For the past six months, march participants have been calling for an end to
 child labor, taking their protests to forty-three countries on four continents. But
 child labor is not just a problem of the developing world. It's estimated
 one million children pick fruits and vegetables in the United States as
 well. Global March participant Diana Mull says it's a disgrace that children are
 exploited in such a highly industrialized country.

 The United States is going to point a finger at other countries and say you
 need to clean up your act, then the United States needs to sweep on its own
 doorsteps and clean up its own act. This is a time when we need to put a
 spotlight and focus on ourselves and make a change.

 Worldwide only sixty countries have adopted conventions on abolishing child
 labor. Most developing world countries including the United States have
 refused to ratify a minimum working age of fifteen. The ILO director for
 child labor Asephy Bekhali admits there's been limited progress in getting
 children off the work bench and into the school yard.

 The ILO cannot enforce international law through uh military means, but
 there is a moral pressure, there is public pressure, which I think acts as a
 major deterrent.

 The ILO is proposing a new convention on the elimination of the worst
 forms of child labor, including slavery, prostitution, and hazardous work,
 but such legislation can only be adopted in nineteen ninety-nine and ratified much later.
 For supporters of the global March, that's too long to wait. Organizer
 Kylash Satiati says it's a crime against humanity to subject children to bonded
 labor. His group rescued seven year old Nasheva from a life of slavery in the
 carpet industry outside Delhi.

 He says that three of us tried to escape one day, but I was caught by the
 employer, he took me and um put me in lock and key for the whole day. Then in
 the evening he brought a stove, with some red hot iron, and then branded my
 whole body with those iron rods, and I lost my speech. I was crying and
 crying, and then I lost speech.

 Bonded labor is a problem not just in India but across south Asia. Pakistan
 has come under heavy international criticism for the pay and conditions of
 children stitching footballs for the world soccer cup. Its child labor
 expert at the UN, Tamina Janjoor, says Pakistan will sign a new
 convention banning extreme forms of exploitation. But, she says, when
 children are the sole breadwinners, the solution is to provide education in
 the workplace. She warns, however, that an immediate improvement is
 unrealistic.

 We all want the elimination of child labor, but the problem is we are a
 developing country, and even in the most industrialized countries, child
 labor continues to exist. So while they have not been able to completely
 eliminate child labor, to expect that certain developing countries w- where
 questions of survival are important questions are expected t- t- to overnight
 to change the situation, that, I'm afraid, will take a little bit of time.

 Global March activists believe poverty is not an excuse for waiting to
 eliminate child labor, but results depend on countries not only signing the
 convention but also implementing it, and that means cracking down on
 companies that exploit child labor. That will be the next step in the long
 battle against international child labor practices. For The World, this
 is Clair Dual in Geneva, Switzerland.
