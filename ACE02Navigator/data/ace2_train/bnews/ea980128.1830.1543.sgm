 Before our final story tonight, a brief review of the developments in the White House crisis. The President's former chief of staff Leon Panetta testified before independent counsel Kenneth Starr's grand jury today.
<time sec="1553.488">
 And he said he had no personal knowledge of any sexual relationship between Mr. Clinton and Monica Lewinsky.
<time sec="1560.754">
 So finally tonight, our regular report on some of the ways in which the government spends your money.
<time sec="1564.998">
 Medicare fraud is one way. In fact, that alone is costing you two billion dollars a year.
<time sec="1571.325">
 We've heard plenty of stories about doctors over charging.
<time sec="1574.743">
 But how about career criminals being in the act?
<time sec="1577.968">
 ABC's John Martin reports tonight on a man
<time sec="1580.672">
 who will tell his story to the Senate tomorrow.

<turn speaker="John_Martin" spkrtype="male" startTime="1585.680" endTime="1600.386">
 Miami, Florida, a glamorous night life.
<time sec="1590.262">
 Perfect for a con artist who ran nightclubs and laundered drug money.
<time sec="1595.080">
 But his most lucrative business, Medicare.
<time sec="1598.481">
 Is it a good way to make money? 
</turn>
<turn speaker="John_Smith" spkrtype="male" dialect="non-native" startTime="1600.386" endTime="1602.427">
 That's a gold mine.
</turn>
<turn speaker="John_Martin" spkrtype="male" startTime="1602.427" endTime="1603.325">
 A gold mine?
</turn>
<turn speaker="John_Smith" spkrtype="male" dialect="non-native" startTime="1603.325" endTime="1604.172">
 um Yes.
</turn>
<turn speaker="John_Martin" spkrtype="male" startTime="1604.172" endTime="1612.886">
 Call him John Smith. He took the federal government for fourteen million dollars before it caught on.
<time sec="1610.019">
 Was it easy to fool the government?
</turn>
<turn speaker="John_Smith" spkrtype="male" dialect="non-native" startTime="1612.886" endTime="1621.233">
 Yes. Really, yes. The fact is, yes.
<time sec="1616.947">
 I did, and many like me still do it.
</turn>
<turn speaker="John_Martin" spkrtype="male" startTime="1621.233" endTime="1671.927">
 Here's how, they buy patient ID numbers from doctors or thieves, 
<time sec="1626.376">
 then bill the government for services they don't provide.
<time sec="1629.060">
 The information they buy costs about two hundred and fifty dollars per patient. 
<time sec="1633.580">
 The Medicare payments they receive run nearly three times that much. Some crooks don't even provide real addresses.
<time sec="1641.032">
 This windy, noisy runway at Miami International Airport is the scene of the crime.
<time sec="1647.386">
 The crooks used this address for a phony medical equipment business. 
<time sec="1652.070">
 They got away with two million dollars because the government never sent anybody here to check. 
<time sec="1657.664">
 Crooks count on that lack of inspection. They listed this laundry, these drop boxes, even this empty store front.
<time sec="1666.274">
 You laundered drug money. You were in w- i- the nightclub business. And you're in the medical business. Which is the best way to make money? 
</turn>
<turn speaker="John_Smith" spkrtype="male" dialect="non-native" startTime="1671.927" endTime="1674.243">
 Bueno.
 Medicare.
</turn>
<turn speaker="John_Martin" spkrtype="male" startTime="1674.243" endTime="1677.570">
 Medicare was better than drugs or nightclubs?
</turn>
<turn speaker="John_Smith" spkrtype="male" dialect="non-native" startTime="1677.570" endTime="1678.243">
 Si.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Susan_Collins" spkrtype="female" startTime="1678.243" endTime="1691.835">
 The problem is Medicare doesn't pay enough attention to screening out unethical people at the front end.
<time sec="1684.100">
 That allows completely bogus businesses with no experience in health care at all to get into the system and to rip it off.
</turn>
<turn speaker="John_Martin" spkrtype="male" startTime="1691.835" endTime="1708.611">
 On the eve of Senator Collins' hearings into Medicare's failures, the government finally says it plans more inspections.
<time sec="1698.825">
 Last year, the lack of them helped lead to losses of more than two billion dollars. It's your money. John Martin, ABC News, Miami.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Peter_Jennings" spkrtype="male" startTime="1708.611" endTime="1723.437">
 The story that the government will hear tomorrow.
<time sec="1710.672">
 That's our report on World News Tonight. Later this evening on Prime Time Live, the dangerous things that can happen 
<time sec="1716.080">
 when a teenager gets the car keys. And on Nightline, the President's reception out on the road.
<time sec="1721.335">
 I'm Peter Jennings. Have a good evening. Good night.
