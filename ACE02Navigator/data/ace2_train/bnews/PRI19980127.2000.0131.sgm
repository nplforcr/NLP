 A Washington grand jury opened its investigation today into
 the latest allegations involving the president and former White
 House intern Monica Lewinsky.
 And the panel called President Clinton's personal secretary,
 Betty Currie.
 Currie is reported to have authorized Lewinsky to return to the
 White House a number of times after the former intern had moved
 to a job at the pentagon.
 During that time, Lewinsky reportedly also sent several
 packages addressed to Currie at the White House.
 Currie declined to comment as she left the proceeding.
