 Vice president Al Gore says the government has a plan to avoid the
 inevitable prospect of increased airplane crashes and fatalities.
 Carl Rochelle reports.

 The forecast is grim.
 Boeing aircraft says unless safety is improved, there could be one major
 airline crash a week worldwide by twenty fifteen.
 The Clinton administration says it's taking steps to reduce those odds.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="212.261" endTime="229.986">
 We can't allow that rise in the number of crashes that would come without
 the action.
 So we have to do everything we can to make air travel even safer.
 And to reduce mechanical and human failures that can lead to disaster.

 Vice President Gore announced several safety initiatives.
 One would deal with the situation where a crew for unknown reasons, flies a perfectly
 good plane into the ground.
 That's what happened at the recent Korean Airline's crash on Guam.
<time sec="242.853">
 Referred to as control flight into a terrain, it was the leading cause of
 accidents between nineteen eighty-seven and ninety-six, claiming nearly twenty-four
 hundred lives.
 The White House is ordering all airlines to begin using enhanced ground
 proximity warning devices within three years.
 The new system uses global satellite navigation and terrain mapping to
 provide increased warning time.

 The administration is also attacking uncontained engine failures, that's
 when a part of the engine breaks off and penetrates the cabin or damages a
 critical part of the plane causing a crash.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="279.482" endTime="291.141">
 With the help of engine manufacturers joining together for the first time,
 we know, now know, how to bring down the rate of accidents caused by uncontained
 engine failures by forty percent.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="291.141" endTime="294.839">
 Aviation industry experts call the plan a step in the right direction.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="294.839" endTime="305.091">
 We're addressing issues that are major, such as controlled flight into
 terrain and uh some of the technology is is already being used.
 And it wil-, will simply be put on more aircraft, and that's a very good idea.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="305.091" endTime="311.414">
 Boeing stands by its forecasts of one accident a week by twenty fifteen, but says the
 White House action may help.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="311.414" endTime="320.353">
 That's the whole reason that we're doing this.
 um We know that with traffic growth that if you have the same accident rate,
 then you're going to have more accidents.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="320.353" endTime="338.45">
 The safety issues are not new, but the increased emphasis is.
 And with the number of passengers at US airports expected to grow to a
 billion a year by twenty ten, experts say now is the time to act to head off more
 serious problems in the future.
 Carl Rochelle, CNN, the White House.
