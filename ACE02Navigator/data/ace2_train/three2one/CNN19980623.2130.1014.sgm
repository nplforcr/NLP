 Travelers may want to check health insurance plans before heading out
 that door.
 Kalin Thomas-Samuel has details about emergency coverage in this edition of
 working ahead.

 Most travelers never consider the thought of medical emergency during a trip.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1031.521" endTime="1042.603">
 The risk for travelers in general, US and international, are uh, number
 one, accidents, number two, cardiovascular disease, and number three,
 infections.

 If a crisis threatens your travels, it pays to understand your health
 insurance policy.
 Most plans will cover you under any circumstance.
 But there are exceptions.
 Some HMOs won't cover the cost of an emergency room visit if the condition
 could have been treated at a less expensive facility.
 For example, a small health care clinic can easily take care of illnesses
 like colds and flu.
 Some health plans have their own clinics.
 So before you go, check to see if your HMO has one at your destination or
 if it offers treatment through an affiliated clinic.

<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1077.351" endTime="1094.725">
 I think you'll find most uh plans are going to cover you adequately for
 anywhere in the United States, whereas when you travel internationally,
 oftentimes you will need a rider on your insurance policy in order to have
 the proper coverage overseas.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1094.725" endTime="1103.748">
 It's especially important to consider additional health insurance if
 you're going to less developed countries.
 You can buy the extra coverage at travel agencies.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1103.748" endTime="1112.351">
 Most travel agents are very familiar with different types of insurance
 policies uh for medical coverage as well as evacuation insurance.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1112.351" endTime="1139.39">
 The cost is about five dollars and fifty cents for each hundred dollars of coverage,
 meaning a ten thousand dollar policy runs five hundred fifty dollars.
 There's even evacuation insurance, which pays to get you out of one country
 and into another in a medical emergency, coverage worth considering if
 your next trip is wild in nature.
