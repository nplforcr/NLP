AT&T Corp. made its biggest move yet into the local telephone market yesterday 
by agreeing to acquire Teleport Communications Group Inc. for $ 11.3 billion. 

The purchase, which was approved by the boards of both companies, marks the 
first major effort by new AT&T Chairman C. Michael Armstrong to revive AT&T, 
which has been slow to react to mounting threats to its core long-distance 
telephone business. 

"It's an indication that Mike Armstrong is serious about local competition and 
serious about getting moving," said Anna-Marie Kovacs, an analyst for the 
brokerage firm Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. "AT&T and Teleport are going after 
the business market, which is where local companies make a lot of their money." 

The deal also will give three major cable television companies, which are 
majority owners of Teleport, a collective 10 percent stake in AT&T. 

By acquiring Teleport, AT&T can offer business customers local and long-distance 
telephone service, and data and Internet access, under its own brand name. Using 
Teleport's local facilities, the company also would be able to reduce the fees 
it pays to local phone companies for access to local telephone customers. 

"It's going to permit us to be much more cost-effective as we go for that local 
business," Armstrong said at a news briefing. "This has competition and growth 
written all over it." AT&T is paying for Teleport with its stock. Teleport 
shareholders will receive 0.943 AT&T shares for each of their Teleport shares, 
putting the deal at $ 59 a share based on AT&T's closing price yesterday of $ 
62.62 1/2 a share, up $ 2.62 1/2. Teleport closed down $ 3.62 1/2 at $ 54.12 1/2 
a share. The companies expect the deal, which must be approved by regulators and 
shareholders, to close by fall. Teleport, based in Staten Island, N.Y., leads a 
new breed of local phone competitors that are invading urban markets to grab the 
most lucrative business customers from the regional Bell companies, GTE Corp. 
and other dominant local carriers. The company is not yet profitable, but is 
expected to post revenue of $ 500 million in 1997. 

Teleport is the largest independent "competitive local exchange carrier," with 
fiber-optic phone networks in 66 local markets nationwide, including Washington, 
Baltimore, New York and Los Angeles. Its major shareholders include cable giants 
Tele-Communications Inc., Comcast Corp. and Cox Enterprises Inc. 

The deal would collectively give those cable firms a 10 percent stake in AT&T, 
which raises new possibilities for AT&T and the cable television industry. Cable 
operators, for example, could begin providing AT&T-branded Internet access over 
their cable lines. AT&T also may one day offer Internet-based telephone service 
to customers through their cable service. 

"I wouldn't be surprised if we saw further talks between AT&T and cable," said 
Brian Adamik, an analyst for the Boston-based consulting firm Yankee Group. 
"Let's face it, there are only two wires into the home. The whole issue of 
cable-telephone could rise again." 

Armstrong would not comment on possible future alliances with cable operators. 
One of his first moves upon taking the job in October, after leaving his post as 
chairman of Hughes Electronics Co., was to sell AT&T's investment in Hughes's 
DirecTV unit, the cable industry's chief direct-broadcast satellite rival. 

Teleport Chairman Robert Annunziata, 49, a 17-year AT&T veteran who left in 1983 
to form Teleport, will become an executive vice president of AT&T and head up 
the company's local services unit. 

Companies such as Teleport have been posing the only significant competition to 
the regional Bells and other local telephone incumbents. WorldCom Inc. has the 
largest presence in urban competitive phone routes through its 1996 purchase of 
MFS Communications Co. for $ 14 billion in stock, and its 1997 acquisition of 
Brooks Fiber Properties Inc. for $ 2.4 billion, announced on the day WorldCom 
made its bid to acquire MCI Communications Corp. 

AT&T has had trouble breaking into the $ 110 billion local telephone market 
despite the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which required the Bells and other 
local carriers to make their local phone lines and equipment available for 
leasing and connection by competitors. 

Residential competition has remained elusive, largely because it's too expensive 
for rivals to build their own facilities into every home. Instead, AT&T and 
other rivals had hoped to lease phone lines from the Bells and other local 
carriers, but are engaged in a battle with the Bells over the prices for such 
access.
