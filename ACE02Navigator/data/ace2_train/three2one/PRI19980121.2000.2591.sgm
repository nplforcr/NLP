</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="2603.828" endTime="2610.805">

 The city could have used some special protection in nineteen seventy-nine

 skill in fashioning pottery and tile, glass too.
 Some families have kept their glass working secrets for more
 than two thousand years.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="2636.125" endTime="2644.898">

 dialect of the Persian language, and have long standing
 cultural ties with neighboring Iran.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="2644.898" endTime="2649.681">
 Think you got it?
 Well, frankly, I don't, but the answer is coming up
 in just a few minutes.
