BEIJING, June 24-
 


Former Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang, ousted in 1989 on the eve of the 
bloody crackdown on democracy demonstrators in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, has 
written a letter asking current party leaders to admit that the move against the 
student-led protests was a grave mistake. 

With President Clinton due to arrive in China Thursday night for a nine-day 
visit, the Reuters news agency obtained a copy of Zhao's letter, which said that 
the killing of hundreds of demonstrators on June 4, 1989, was "one of the 
biggest human rights problems this century." 

Clinton is the first U.S. president to visit China since Communist leaders 
ordered troops to open fire on the Tiananmen demonstrators. The President has 
been criticized by members of Congress and U.S. human rights groups for agreeing 
to take part in an official welcoming ceremony next to the square. 

"President Clinton's visit to China marks a turn for the better in Sino-U.S. 
relations," wrote Zhao, 78, who was general secretary of the Communist Party and 
now lives under loose house arrest in Beijing. "But the United States and the 
whole of the West have again and again raised the June 4 problem and the human 
rights problem of China," he added. "Rather than let it become an obstacle to 
international relations, it would be better to resolve the June 4 problem 
ourselves voluntarily." 

White House aides have said that Clinton will speak publicly about human rights 
problems in China during his trip but that he will not attempt to meet with 
Chinese dissidents. Such meetings would anger his host, President Jiang Zemin, 
and possibly put the dissidents in danger of arrest, U.S. officials have said. 

Zhao was toppled from power when other party leaders, including senior leader 
Deng Xiaoping, decided that he was too sympathetic toward the student 
protesters. Zhao opposed the imposition of martial law and went to Tiananmen 
Square to plead with student leaders to disperse the crowds to avoid disaster. 
Later, after tanks rolled into the square, Zhao defended the students and their 
demands in a secret statement to party leaders. 

In recent years, the Chinese Communist Party has modified its description of the 
1989 demonstrations, changing its characterization from a "counterrevolutionary 
riot," to an "incident," to the current usage of a very mild version of the word 
"disturbance." But the party has steadfastly defended the decision to order 
troops to fire on demonstrators. 

Zhao's letter is likely to irritate Jiang, who replaced him as Communist Party 
chief in 1989. Zhao made a similar plea to party leaders last September during 
an important party congress, and Jiang, in an interview last October, said 
sternly that Zhao "must accept party discipline." 

Despite his age, Zhao is still considered a potential political force, capable 
of rallying reformers within the party. Following the September letter, there 
was a tightening of restrictions on Zhao, who has tried to play golf regularly 
in recent years. 

Recently, the government has also tightened its watch on dissidents in an effort 
to avoid any disruption during Clinton's visit. Several Chinese who have visited 
Beijing from other cities have been picked up by police and sent home. Police 
also detained a dissident today in the southern city of Guilin, which Clinton is 
to visit on July 1. Eight policemen took Li Xiaolong, 34, a onetime member of 
the defunct dissident group Human Rights Voice, from his home and placed him in 
custody.
