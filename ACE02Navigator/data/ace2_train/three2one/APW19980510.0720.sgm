JERUSALEM (AP) _ An Iranian-born general was named Israel's next
military chief of staff Sunday, ending a week-long wrangle that
critics said had injected too much politics into the army.
Maj. Gen. Shaul Mofaz, 50, a deputy chief of staff and close
friend of Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, was chosen over his
rival, a childhood neighbor of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
The choice was to have been announced on May 1, but was delayed
nearly two weeks because of intense lobbying.
Although the selection must be formally approved by Israel's
Cabinet Tuesday, Netanyahu's acceptance of Mordechai's choice rules
out any other candidates.
It was not yet clear whether the other contender, Maj. Gen.
Matan Vilnai, who is also a deputy chief of staff, would stay on in
his position or resign from the army.
As a young soldier, Mofaz failed the entrance exam for officer's
school three times but later developed a reputation as a keen
tactician and strategist.
He rose quickly through the ranks of an elite paratrooper unit
in the 1973 Yom Kippur War and participated in a daring rescue of a
hijacked plane in Entebbe, Uganda in 1976.
He led troops in Lebanon and served as the army's commander of
forces in the occupied West Bank. In 1994 he took charge of the
Southern Command and two years later was moved to the head of
military planning.
Vilnai had been considered the natural successor of current army
chief Lt. Gen. Amnon Shahak, who retires from service in July. The
Harvard-educated Vilnai was a star in Israel's army, promoted to
brigadier-general at the age of 34 and the son a famous Jerusalem
professor who authored Israel's most popular guide book.
But Mofaz's close relationship with the Iraqi-born Mordechai and
their common backgrounds as Jews of Sephardic, or Middle Eastern,
origin apparently enable him to get the job.
Mofaz, whose family came to Israel when he was 9, becomes the
country's second Sephardic army chief after Moshe Levy, who served
in the 1980s. Mofaz's appointment was seen as a boost for the
Sephardic population, who make up 50 percent of the country but
have held few powerful positions in government and the military.
