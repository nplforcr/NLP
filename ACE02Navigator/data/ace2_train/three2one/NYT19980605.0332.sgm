PARIS _ Nine months after the car crash that killed Diana,
Princess of Wales, and her companion, Dodi Fayed, a French
investigator on Friday grilled photographers who pursued the
couple, relatives of the dead and witnesses to try to determine how
it happened.
The investigator, Judge Herve Stephan, is trying to determine
whether nine photographers and a motorcyclist arrested at the scene
of the accident last Aug. 31 may have somehow caused the chauffeur
of the couple's Mercedes to lose control and crash into a tunnel
support pillar at high speed.
The driver, Henri Paul, acting security chief of the Ritz Hotel,
owned by Dodi Fayed's father, Mohamed Fayed, also died in the
crash. The French authorities later determined that he was legally
drunk at the time of the accident and had been taking
antidepressant drugs.
Stephan convened Mohamed Fayed, Diana's mother, Frances Shand
Kydd, the photographers and a battery of lawyers Friday morning in
the bidding room of the medieval Palace of Justice, a chamber
normally used to auction seized goods, for a virtual reconstruction
of the accident.
The sole survivor of the crash, Trevor Rees-Jones, a bodyguard
who worked for the Fayeds, did not attend.
``The immorality, the inhumanity of what they did,'' Fayed said
of the photographers during a break in the proceedings outside the
palace, on the Ile de la Cite, near Notre Dame. ``If I was not in a
courtroom, I would hang them all. They were like vultures around
the bodies.''
Mrs. Shand Kydd did not speak to reporters. ``She won't talk to
me,'' Fayed said. ``She thinks she's in the royal family. I'm just
an ordinary guy, a working-class guy. It's snobbery.''
Fayed, an Egyptian citizen who also owns the Harrods department
store in London, has been fighting for acceptance by the British
establishment for years. He has also encouraged speculation that
the accident was somehow arranged by the British secret service to
ensure that Diana, as the mother of a potential heir to the British
throne and head of the Church of England, would not marry his son,
a Muslim. Diana and Prince Charles, the eldest son of Queen
Elizabeth II, were divorced before the accident.
With conspiracy theories and denials swirling around England
since the accident, Stephan has been doggedly trying to determine
who may indeed be guilty of a criminal act in the case: Paul, the
photographers, the hotel management or perhaps the elusive driver
of a white Fiat Uno supposedly brushed by the Mercedes just before
the crash.
Despite a nationwide investigation, neither car nor driver has
ever turned up. French law normally requires a reconstruction of a
crime scene, but Stephan has reportedly waived one so far because
blocking traffic for hours at the accident site in a busy underpass
beneath the Place de l'Alma, on the right bank of the Seine, would
be impractical.

Friday's session was closed to the public and to reporters, but
what little trickled out indicated that the inquiry was stuck at
about the point where it has been since late last year.
Various witnesses have said that Paul, the driver, was legally
drunk but that the Ritz management and the passengers in the car
did not realize it.
The photographers have said they were too far behind the
speeding car to have caused it to run out of control and have
denied charges that they neglected to try to summon help for the
victims because they were busy snapping gory pictures of the scene.
