 The State Department issued its annual report on human rights today. The
 department says that China is still among the worst offenders. The government still stifles almost all
 dissent. In Russia, the department estimates that ten to twenty thousand people
 die every year because of deplorable prison conditions. In Algeria, the
 US believes that government security forces may be involved in murdering
 civilians every month.
 Some of the other countries that make the list are Turkey, Iran, Cuba,
 Burma, Sudan and Afghanistan.
