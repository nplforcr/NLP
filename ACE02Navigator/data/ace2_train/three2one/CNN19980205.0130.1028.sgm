 The federal aviation administration, racing to update the nation's air
 traffic control system is already behind schedule.
 Outside experts told a congressional hearing that if progress continues to
 slip, the FAA won't be ready for the new millennium until two thousand nine.

 i- I think we have to be honest with ourselves.
 We are looking down the barrel of a potential disaster.

 How big of a disaster?
 A report from the general accounting office suggests it could be

 direct planes in flight and notify pilots of potentially hazardous weather
 conditions, could fail if they are not renovated in time.

 FAA needs to do a better job of managing this problem.
 We are behind, and that is unacceptable.

 and an ongoing renovation of the software on old

 But the FAA will have to do more than make promises.
 In fact, doubters are already voicing their opinions.

 A survey of technology executives conducted by CIO magazine showed half
 of those questioned expressed reservations about flying on the first day of
 the year two thousand.

 Airline executives are also pressuring the FAA because no matter how
 successful the airlines are in updating their own operations,
<time sec="1138.861">
 they remain dependent on the FAA.

 In its report, the GAO warns that should FAA systems not be year two thousand
 compliant, the domino effect would be far reaching.

 Readying technology for the twenty-first century is the highest profile challenge
