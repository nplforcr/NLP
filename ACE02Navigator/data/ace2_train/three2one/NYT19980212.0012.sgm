WASHINGTON _ After a year of resisting an independent campaign
finance inquiry, Attorney General Janet Reno changed direction
Wednesday, formally asking a judicial panel to appoint an outside
prosecutor to investigate Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt's role
in his agency's action to kill an Indian gambling project.
Reno asked the panel to instruct the new counsel, the sixth one
to be appointed during the Clinton administration, to look at
whether Babbitt lied to Congress and whether the decision to kill
the project was ``criminally corrupted.''
But the charter she proposed for the Babbitt inquiry was notably
narrow in scope, and would not permit the new independent counsel
the latitude to investigate broader campaign fund-raising issues,
as many prominent Republicans have sought.
Reno's decision comes at a hard time for the White House,
creating a second front of vulnerability at the same time President
Clinton's aides battle another independent prosecutor, Kenneth W.
Starr. He is conducting the investigation into the president's
relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky, the former White House
intern.
The appointment of the fourth independent prosecutor to
investigate one of Clinton's Cabinet officers, is the first outside
inquiry into political fund-raising. At the least, it threatens
Babbitt and his aides to a time-consuming, expensive and
potentially threatening inquiry into whether Babbitt's agency
killed the Chippewa casino project in Hudson, Wisc., in return for
campaign contributions from rival tribes.
Babbitt said Wednesday that he was disappointed by the decision
and that the Interior Department's action on the Indian project
``was the right one, made on the merits for the right reasons.''
``Those who made the decision have testified unanimously that
they were not influenced by improper political pressure,'' he said
in a statement released by his office Wednesday afternoon while he
was traveling to the Everglades. ``If it's true that only an
independent counsel can resolve a matter like this if it involves a
cabinet secretary, then I think the list of hidden costs one has to
pay for public service has just grown a little longer.''
Clinton expressed confidence that Babbitt would be exonerated.
``I have known Bruce Babbitt for many years. He is a man of the
highest integrity and dedicated public servant. I am convinced that
when this matter is concluded he will be vindicated,'' the
president said. ``I look forward to his continuing service to the
American people.''

Other Clinton cabinet members to undergo independent counsel
scrutiny are former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy, former Housing
Secretary Henry Cisneros, and former Commerce Secretary Ron Brown,
who died in April 1996 when his plane crashed in Croatia. Another
independent counsel investigated Eli Segal, the head of Americorp,
but decided not to prosecute.
Reno also rejected efforts to appoint counsels to investigate
allegations against two other cabinet officers, former
Transportation Secretary Federico Pena and former Energy Secretary
Hazel O'Leary.
The Babbitt inquiry comes on the heels of the first indictments
in the Justice Department's campaign finance investigation, with
Democrats facing the prospect that prosecutors would try to seek
the cooperation of one defendant, Yah Lin Trie, a prominent
fund-raiser and friend of President Clinton.
Reno's decision also comes at a moment of furious debate over
the legitimacy of independent counsel inquiries. Clinton's aides
have bitterly attacked Starr for roaming far beyond his original
mandate, probing the Whitewater land deal, to investigate the
Lewinsky case. They blame Starr for improperly leaking confidential
information obtained in his inquiry.
If Starr's widening inquiry exemplifies how independent
prosecutors extend their jurisdictional boundaries, Republicans
have hoped that the Babbitt inquiry would be a spear-point for a
much broader campaign finance investigation into the frenzy of
Democratic fund-raising in the 1996 campaign along with related
unresolved issues, like whether the Chinese government improperly
influence the political process.
But Reno appeared Wednesday to have attempted to head off any
such effort by the Babbitt independent prosecutor, who will be
named not by Reno, but by the three judge panel. Reno left scant
room for the independent prosecutor to roam freely, narrowly
wording the charter to limit the inquiry to Babbitt.

The decision to open the inquiry into Babbitt, the former
Arizona governor who unsuccessfully sought the presidency in 1988,
was a painful choice for Reno, aides said. The decision was not
based on her assessment of the evidence against Babbitt, but on the
law itself which left her no room to avoid seeking the appointment.
In Babbitt's case, the available evidence seems inconclusive.
Babbitt has said repeatedly that he played no role in the Interior
Department's decision to deny the casino permit. But a lawyer
lobbying in behalf of the Chippewa group that sought the project
has said Babbitt told him of a concerted White House lobbying
effort to thwart the deal.
Nevertheless, the law requires Reno to go forward with an
independent counsel if she cannot resolve whether the subject may
have broken the law. In the case of Babbitt, the Justice Department
cannot use investigative techniques, like compelling testimony
before a grand jury, that it would almost certainly employ if the
subject was not covered by the Independent Counsel statute.
Interior officials in Washington rejected the Chippewa casino
permit in 1995 after a group of rival tribes hired a high-powered
Democratic lobbyist, Patrick O'Connor, to overturn the permit.
O'Connor had important contacts at the White House, like Harold M.
Ickes, the former deputy chief of staff and Bruce Lindsey, the
presidential counselor.
In 1996, after the Interior Department killed the project, the
Democrats received $230,000 in contributions from the tribes whose
own gaming ventures might have lost business had the Department
approved the project. Republican lawmakers said the permit issue
stood out as a clear-cut case of a government favor in exchange for
campaign contributions.
The casino decision itself is not under direct scrutiny in the
inquiry. Instead, the independent prosecutor will focus on perjury
and the truthfulness of statements made by Babbitt to lawmakers
about the permit decision.
Babbitt's statements conflict with those of a lobbyist, Paul F.
Eckstein, a former law school classmate and law partner of Babbitt.
The Chippewas hired Eckstein as a lobbyist in an effort win
approval of the permit on the site of failed dog track in
Wisconsin.
On the day of the permit decision, Eckstein talked briefly with
Babbitt. By Eckstein's account, Babbitt told him that Ickes had
ordered a quick resolution of the case. Eckstein added that the
secretary had also asked whether his old friend was aware how much
the prevailing Indian group had contributed.
When first asked about the remarks, Babbitt denied to a senator
that he ever made them. Later, after the casino issue ignited into
a potential scandal, Babbitt changed his story. Babbitt admitted
that he had mentioned Ickes' name, but only as a kind of closing
comment to excuse himself from the meeting with Eckstein.
``I never spoke with Mr. Ickes about the Hudson matter, and I
shouldn't have given Mr. Eckstein any reason to suppose that I
had,'' Babbitt said in testimony about the issue to a House
investigating committee on Jan. 29. ``I regret the remark. It was a
mistake. But that's all that it was.''
