President Clinton yesterday nominated a University of New Mexico administrator 
to take over the contentious post of commissioner of the Food and Drug 
Administration, and the nomination immediately drew hints of opposition from 
some members of the Senate. 

Clinton selected Jane E. Henney, vice president for health sciences at the 
University of New Mexico, a doctor and cancer specialist who has worked at the 
National Cancer Institute and served as a deputy to then-FDA Commissioner David 
A. Kessler from 1992 to 1994. If confirmed, Henney, 51, would be the first woman 
to become FDA commissioner. 

Clinton urged quick Senate action on the long-awaited nomination, saying that 
senators "will conclude that she is extremely well qualified to serve as 
commissioner as the agency prepares itself to meet the challenges of the 21st 
century." 

FDA officials said that Henney would not be available for comment until the 
confirmation process is complete. Through a spokeswoman, Henney said: "There is 
no greater honor than to be asked to return to public service and to lead the 
FDA, an agency that plays such a vital role in protecting and promoting the 
health of the American people." 

The nomination comes as the FDA faces a number of challenges. The agency, which 
regulates 25 cents of every dollar consumers spend, is more prominent than ever. 
It bears responsibility for ensuring that drugs are safe and effective, and has 
a major role in maintaining the safety of foods and the blood supply. In 
addition, the agency faces an often-hostile Congress, which last year passed 
extensive FDA reform legislation. That alone presents a daunting task for the 
agency, which must now produce a shelf of new regulations, "guidances" and other 
publications to fulfill the mandates of the law. 

Henney would bring strong skills to such a task, having had much to do with the 
FDA's implementation of landmark 1992 legislation that set up a user fee system 
that dramatically shortened review times of new drugs, officials said. "She's a 
lot more qualified than anyone who's ever taken the job before," including 
Kessler, said a senior FDA official. 

Kessler yesterday called Henney "one of the best physician-managers I know. 
She's her own person and will do a wonderful, do a terrific job." 

Since Kessler left the agency more than a year ago to head the Yale University 
Medical School, the FDA has been run by its lead deputy commissioner, Michael 
Friedman. 

Representatives of industries FDA regulates said yesterday that they knew little 
about Henney but hoped to learn more during the confirmation process. "This is 
as important a nomination as the FDA has ever had in its history," said Carl 
Feldbaum, head of the Biotechnology Industries Association. Any new commissioner 
has to plot a careful middle course, Feldbaum said, between "people in the 
agency who want no change or slow change" and some people in industry and 
Congress "who think any change is beneficial." 

Senators said they will vet Henney carefully. Sen. James M. Jeffords (R-Vt.), 
who chairs the Labor and Human Resources Committee, which will consider the 
nomination, said: "It is not going to be a quick one," because senators have 
already raised questions about the nominee. He predicted that hearings are 
unlikely before the end of July and "probably much later." 

Aides to several Republican senators wanted to know if Henney played a role in 
the agency's promotion of RU-486, the French "abortion pill." 

Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), who championed Henney's nomination, said, "She 
knows the issues, she knows the agency, and she's a proven leader." While 
Kennedy made no reference to controversy over the nomination, a Democratic 
staffer acknowledged, "Anyone who follows in Dr. Kessler's footsteps is going to 
get a lot of scrutiny." Another source said that senators know little about her 
but that her service under Kessler and strong support from Kennedy may raise 
concerns among some Republicans. 

Kessler brought an unusually high profile to the post with his agenda, which 
included asserting FDA authority over tobacco for the first time. But he also 
became a symbol of over-aggressive government for some members of Congress 
because of some of his actions, such as his attempt to crack down on health 
claims made for foods and nutritional supplements. 

A senior administration official predicted that Henney would ultimately gain 
confirmation in the Senate: "She comes to this job with a broad base of 
support."
