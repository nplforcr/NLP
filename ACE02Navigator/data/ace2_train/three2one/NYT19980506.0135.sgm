If you are willing to pay a premium up front and put up with
plenty of annoyance in exchange for bargain prices on spoken-word
programming, the digital world has a gadget for you. The Audible
Player is a pocket-sized 3.5-ounce plastic device shaped like a
child's mitten without the thumb. It costs about $200 and is
designed to play audio books and other programs that you buy and
download in digital form from the Web.
In other words, it is a lot like a standard Walkman-style
cassette or CD player, except that the Walkman is cheaper, has high
enough fidelity for music as well as words, takes just seconds to
swap material, plays in stereo, runs quite awhile on standard
batteries and does not require Windows 95 or NT. But the Audible
Player weighs less and has fewer moving parts.
The Audible Player, made by Audible Inc. of Wayne, N.J., comes
with headphones, a carrying pouch, an adapter that slips into a
standard cassette player and a cradle, which must be connected to
AC power and a serial port to transfer data from a computer to the
device. An accompanying CD-ROM supplies the requisite plumbing
software as well as several hours of audio programming, including
poetry by Robert Frost, humor by Dave Barry and selections from
Frank Herbert's ``Dune,'' The Harvard Business Review and Car Talk.
Those trial programs are also available free at www.audible.com
in exchange for information about yourself. You do not need the
stand-alone player to listen to this or any of Audible's other
programming; player software that works on Windows 95 and NT
computers is free for the downloading.
The site offers more than 4,000 programs, from Sue Grafton's ``A
is for Alibi'' to Zora Neal Hurston's stories, at prices as low as
95 cents for some short subjects and as much as $12.95 for a few
business titles. Because Audible delivers digital bits rather than
a physical package, Frank McCourt's 4{-hour abridg-ment of
``Angela's Ashes'' costs just $8.95; the same reading on CD-ROM
from Amazon.com goes for $21 plus shipping. An unabridged version
of George Orwell's ``Animal Farm'' costs $6.95 from Audible; at
Amazon, the cassette is $11.87 plus shipping.
These bargains have their drawbacks. Audio clips played directly
on my 90 megahertz Pentium machine stammered to the point of
uselessness whenever other programs were doing anything of
consequence; things worked without a hitch on a 400 megahertz
machine, so the cutoff point presumably lies between. Even at its
best, though, Audible's compression scheme reduces audio quality to
the point where some ``programs with substantial musical portions
are currently unavailable.''
Buying programs over the Web is simple enough, but downloading
can easily take half an hour for a 4-megabyte, 2-hour program,
which is as much as the player can hold. And the site needs work.
When I tried downloading the 2-hour April 3 edition of National
Public Radio's ``Talk of the Nation Science Friday'' for $2.95, the
excerpt I received was only an hour long and the wrong show.
Programs in that series are available free at NPR's site anyhow.
The player has a volume knob plus five buttons that serve
multiple functions and take getting used to. The buttons let you
jump from section to section of a program, bookmark favorite
passages and skip forward or backward seconds or minutes at a time.
But you cannot sample the audio at fast forward, and aside from an
LED that flashes puzzling colored patterns, all feedback is
audible. That means you cannot really tell where you are in a
program, and you cannot tell by looking what programs are stored in
the device. The unit cries out for an alphanumeric display.
For cars and other places where more than one person might want
to listen, the player can transmit an FM radio signal that can be
picked up by a standard radio. First you tune the radio to an
unused channel, which is not always easy in urban areas. Then you
set the player to generate a steady tone, slowly turn an unmarked
dial on the back until you hear the tone through the radio
speakers, and switch to programming from the device.
Getting all that to work is neither easy nor worth the bother,
because the signal tends to break up at the slightest provocation.
I finally gave up and switched to the cassette-player adapter. It
did not deliver particularly good sound, but at least it worked.
Air travelers take note: According to the manual, the player's FM
radiation makes it a potential navigational hazard if it is turned
on while the headphones are unplugged.
Because the unit lacks removable memory and can hold only about
two hours of content, you must return it to the cradle often for
refills. Uploads from the computer take about 10 minutes and are
usually smart enough to avoid erasing what you have not listened to
already. But recharging the battery takes 60 to 90 minutes. A full
charge is supposed to last at least three hours, but not
necessarily long enough for two full programs. An extra battery
costs $25 and can be recharged separately in a well on the back of
the cradle.
The device can also accept a downloadable format called Mobile
RealAudio, not to be confused with the popular standard RealAudio.
It may conceivably catch on, but only one site,
www.dailybriefing.com, offers programming that uses it.
The player is hardly a work of art. The volume control on the
one I tried moved jerkily, and the case nearly came apart when I
inadvertently inserted the battery the wrong way. The button on the
cradle does not match the one that appears in on-screen
instructional messages, and tends to make the cradle slide across
the desk whenever you push it. Though there is a 30-day
unconditional refund policy, the warranty against defects lasts
just 90 days.
The Internet will undoubtedly be a major conduit for audio
programming in the coming years, and the Audible Player is probably
worthy of a minor footnote in the annals of Internet commerce
despite its many limitations. But the next Walkman this is not.
