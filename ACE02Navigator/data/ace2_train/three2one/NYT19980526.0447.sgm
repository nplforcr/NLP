WASHINGTON _ If only Leonard Bernstein could see it: Gerry Adams
in Armani from Macy's, with all the New York society babes chasing
after him.
The late conductor would truly appreciate the Radical Chic
transformation of the Sinn Fein leader as he makes his U.S. victory
lap this week.
Adams, considered a miraculous hero by some and a cold stone
murderer by others, was dubbed ``Ireland's Black Panther'' by
Vanity Fair. In his essay ``Radical Chic,'' Tom Wolfe skewered the
New York elite in the '60s who were feting Black Panthers, feeding
them little Roquefort cheese morsels off silver trays held by
uniformed maids.
Now Washington, New York and Hollywood are caught up in Irish
terrorist chic.
``Gerry has got that revolutionary aura, that whiff of
cordite,'' says one friend. ``Bianca Jagger calls him. All the rich
American society hostesses throw themselves at him. He's amused by
it.''
Thursday the revolutionary Socialist will stroll through the New
York Stock Exchange with its chairman, Richard Grasso. The
49-year-old, who is likely to be elected next month to help run the
new Northern Ireland government, has meetings with top financiers
and fund-raisers with celebrities in New York, before coming to the
White House on Friday to see the national security adviser, Sandy
Berger _ with a probable Clinton drop-by.
Anjelica Huston, Donald Trump, and Martin Sheen have all partied
with Gerry. Adams groupies include young Clintonites who worked on
the Irish issue. ``He's their Ho Chi Minh,'' dryly notes Mike
Barnacle, the Boston Globe columnist.
It was not long ago that Adams was so isolated that his voice
was not allowed to be broadcast on British or Irish TV or radio.
(Actors spoke his words.)
The Unionist leader David Trimble did not speak to, or shake
hands with, Adams during the Stormont talks or during their ``Yes''
campaign, though the two ended up side by side in the men's room.
One top Irish official praised Adams, saying ``He took his horse
to the highest fence.'' Because the Sinn Fein leader is so smooth
and carefully calculating, the official said, it is easy to
underestimate the difficulty _ and danger, in an organization known
to kill its own _ of keeping the cease-fire largely intact while
renegotiating Sinn Fein's traditional position of unity or nothing.
The man who bears the scars of bullet wounds from one
assassination attempt and the memories of more recent ones, the man
who can never sleep two nights in the same place faces more high
fences on the sticky issue of decommissioning.
``What this man is trying to do is unparalleled in Irish
history, trying to take an armed revolutionary movement and put it
on the political path,'' said Niall O'Dowd, publisher of The Irish
Voice. ``It didn't work for Michael Collins. There are enormous
risks.'' O'Dowd spurred peace by playing matchmaker between Sinn
Fein and the White House.
I talked to Adams at Sinn Fein headquarters in Belfast last
week. Sitting outside the heavily fortified stucco building, he
took off his sandals and green socks to put balm on a wasp bite he
got while hill walking. Besides hiking, he relaxes by listening to
music. ``I'm increasingly taken by Ry Cooder,'' he said.
``That's a chopper you hear,'' he said, about a hovering British
surveillance helicopter. Pointing to the window grates, he adds:
``There were bomb attacks, rocket attacks. See those marks in the
wall?''
He knows Ian Paisley wants to sabotage the new government; he
knows prejudice dies hard.
``My home was bombed, my wife and son were at home when a hand
grenade was exploded at the house,'' he said. ``So if I'm prepared
to reach out the hand of friendship to the people who did that, and
shot me, I think that gives me some moral right to say to others,
hey, let's get real here. OK, people got killed. We all lost
friends.''
Will there ever be Irish unity? ``I certainly think, if God
spares me, it will be reunited in my lifetime.''
Does he dream of being the Taoiseach of a united Ireland? ``No,
I will have retired gracefully by then.''
And which ministry does he want in the new government?
``Minister of Funny Walks,'' he replied, as the helicopter whirred
above.
