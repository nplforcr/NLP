DAVOS, Switzerland _ Asia's economic meltdown has spurred all
sorts of would-be geo-architects to try to design some new, global
mechanism that will regulate international capital flows and
miraculously prevent global investors and speculators from ever
again wreaking havoc.
I am deeply skeptical about such ideas _ not because I oppose
tempering market excesses, but because I think that trying to do it
on a global scale is nearly impossible. Risk, fear, greed and
excess are intrinsic to markets. You cannot legislate them out
without paying a huge price.
What's interesting is that while Westerners are trying to
redesign the market, the Thais, Koreans and Mexicans at this year's
Davos World Economic Forum were focused on redesigning themselves.
They think their solution is better local government, not global
government. Their countries were like 50-watt bulbs plugged into
250-watt sockets, and when the surge came from the electronic herd
of global investors, they blew up. Their reaction is to try to
protect themselves with better governance, better regulation and
more transparency at home. Which is why both Thailand and Korea
elected the most democratic parties in their countries at the
depths of this economic crisis.
''There are some voices saying that perhaps integration has gone
too far and too quickly _ especially in financial markets,''
Mexico's president, Ernesto Zedillo, told me. ''Well, I happen to
believe just the opposite. Globalization poses challenges, but it
offers tremendous opportunities. The fact that finance capital can
move instantaneously indeed poses a risk, but jumping from that to
say that we need to control movements of capital is totally
wrong.''
Yes, added Zedillo, we need a strong IMF to help in emergencies
and to detect distortions in countries or individual banks. But at
the end of the day, he said, ''all of these financial flows end up
in a local financial system, or as resources to be lent by local
banks. What we have to look at is whether these (local) financial
systems are sufficiently installing good banking and financial
practices.''
The Thai prime minister, Chuan Leekpai, told me: ''If you are
going to be part of this global market you had better be able to
defend yourself from this market ... One of the lessons this crisis
has taught us is that many of our structures and institutions were
not ready for this new era. Now we have to adapt ourselves to meet
international standards. The whole of society expects it. They are
looking for better government and transparent government.''
You Jong-keun, the chief economic policy adviser to South
Korea's newly elected president, said: ''In the past, the Korean
government used its political muscle to emasculate the rights of
shareholders, and business leaders were given power to make
irresponsible business decisions. We are going to strengthen the
rights of shareholders and help make sure that business decisions
are taken in an accountable fashion.''
As Bob Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International,
put it: ''If your domestic institutions are strong, then you don't
need very strong global institutions. If domestic institutions
inside countries are weak, it won't matter how strong your global
institutions are. They will not be effective.''
Democracy does not guarantee that you will never have an
economic crisis. We know that. Markets overshoot. Investors take
crazy risks. But the more democratic, accountable and open your
governance, especially as an emerging market, the less likely it is
that your financial system will be exposed to surprises, the easier
it will be for you to improve and adapt when it is, and the more
legitimacy your government will have to share the pain when change
is required.
Of those Asian nations who were fully plugged into the market
(China is not), those with the most non-corrupt, transparent and
accountable financial systems _ Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore _ have
been hurt the least. Those that had democratic, but corrupt,
systems _ Thailand and Korea _ were hurt the second worst, but at
least have been able to respond quickly by voting in better
governance. And the country that is going to melt down is
Indonesia, which remains plugged into the electronic herd, but its
corrupt, authoritarian regime can't adapt.
''Look around the neighborhood,'' said the Thai finance
minister, Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda. ''Good governance is the only
real protection.''
