 Good evening. There are clear indications tonight the crisis in the White House 
<time sec="107.561">
 is growing worse for President Clinton, possibly much worse. A new ABC News poll today shows less than half of Americans believe Mr. Clinton has quote the honesty and integrity to serve effectively. A poll also shows that forty-eight per cent of Americans 
<time sec="123.006">
 believe the President did have an affair with Monica Lewinsky. Thirty-five per cent believe he told her to lie. And if the President lied under oath by denying the affair, 
<time sec="133.159">
 sixty-seven per cent of Americans think he should resign. The crisis in the White House is now four days old, so you can see 
<time sec="139.853">
 how quickly events are moving. And there were fresh developments today. 
<time sec="144.231">
 We have several reports, beginning with ABC's Jackie Judd in Washington.

<turn speaker="spkr_2" spkrtype="male" startTime="148.384" endTime="153.414">
 What about putting the squeeze on uh Ms. Lewinsky a- out at the Ritz Carlton?
</turn>
<turn speaker="Kenneth_Starr" spkrtype="male" startTime="153.414" endTime="154.394">
 No comment.

<turn speaker="Jackie_Judd" spkrtype="female" startTime="154.394" endTime="181.843">
 The struggle between independent counsel Ken Starr and lawyer William Ginsburg about
<time sec="159.506">
 Monica Lewinsky's future reached no resolution today. Ginsburg is demanding immunity from prosecution for Lewinsky
<time sec="167.149">
 if she cooperates in the probe. Starr seems unprepared at this point to agree. Because Starr could potentially bring such charges as perjury and obstruction of justice against Lewinsky,
<time sec="178.598">
 some analysts say that he has the upper hand.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Jonathan_Turley" spkrtype="male" startTime="181.843" endTime="194.047">
 Ken Starr knows going in that he needs the cooperation of Monica Lewinsky. 
<time sec="187.057">
 But he also knows that Monica Lewinsky desperately needs the protection of the independent counsel. She doesn't have a good option.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Jackie_Judd" spkrtype="female" startTime="194.047" endTime="208.363">
 But Starr faces a dilemma. If Lewinsky changes her story to say there was an affair with Mr. Clinton, and that he did ask her to lie,
<time sec="201.628">
 will she then be accused of saying whatever it takes to save herself? The President's lawyer certainly thinks so.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Robert_Bennett" spkrtype="male" startTime="208.363" endTime="221.424">
 Everybody e- e- e- can bend if if placed under enough pressure to bend. And uh Mr. Starr seems hell bent on uh on on getting President Clinton.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Jackie_Judd" spkrtype="female" startTime="221.424" endTime="254.812">
 Because Starr knows that Lewinsky's credibility will be questioned no matter what, 
<time sec="226.057">
 he's moving quickly to seize evidence that would stand on its own in a case. A source tells ABC News that Lewinsky consented to having
<time sec="234.088">
 FBI agents go through her apartment at the Watergate on Thursday for evidence related to the alleged affair with Mr. Clinton.
<time sec="241.802">
 And then, of course, there are the tapes recorded by Lewinsky's friend, Linda Tripp. Today, a New York literary agent admitted that she told Tripp to tape the calls
<time sec="251.302">
 as a way of protecting herself if all of this became public.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Lucianne_Goldberg" spkrtype="female" startTime="254.812" endTime="265.628">
 It's just your word against the world. And before I go out with you and make it my world and my reputation, 
<time sec="261.628">
 my family against the world, we got to do something.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Jackie_Judd" spkrtype="female" startTime="265.628" endTime="282.292">
 Tonight, Newsweek released excerpts from some of the tapes. In one portion,
<time sec="270.588">
 Lewinsky says, If I needed to, I would say this did not happen. And she also predicted she would quote get personally screwed if it ever came to that. Forrest?

<turn speaker="Forrest_Sawyer" spkrtype="male" startTime="282.292" endTime="306.557">
 Jackie Judd in Washington. Thank you, Jackie. As the investigation continues, 
<time sec="285.639">
 President Clinton has been meeting today with his top advisors, trying
<time sec="289.026">
 to find a strategy to cope with a crisis that could derail his presidency. However, Mr. Clinton did take time this afternoon
<time sec="296.169">
 to practice his State of the Union speech, which he is delivering on Tuesday. ABC's Sam Donaldson joins us with the latest from the White House. And it's a most
<time sec="303.781">
 difficult circumstance under which to deliver the speech, Sam.
