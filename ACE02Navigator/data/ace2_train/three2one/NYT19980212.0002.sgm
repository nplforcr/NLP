YAMANOUCHI, Japan _ ``ROSS IS THE CHAMPION. GIVE THE GOLD
BACK!''
The words were written in black marker on a linen hotel napkin,
and the young man holding that napkin up i the drizzle at the
bottom of the snowboarding halfpipe run this morning was the
Canadian rider Michael Michalchuck.
``I made it last night because I believe in Ross,'' said
Michalchuck, 20, from Calgary.
Ross Rebagliati, the Canadian snowboarder who has been stripped
of his gold medal in the giant slalom by the International Olympic
Committee after testing positive for marijuana, was not one of the
spectators Thursday at the Kanbayashi Snowboard Park. But he was
unquestionably the central figure as the men's and women's halfpipe
riders made their Olympic debuts.
``Ross won fair and square; he is the gold medalist, and no one
can deny him that,'' Michalchuck said. ``I don't understand why
this is happening. He is a friend of mine, and he should be given
the gold back. I saw him before this, and he was on top of the
world. This should never have happened to him.''
Michalchuck decided to make his very public appeal on Wednesday
night, and when he finished his opening run, he unstrapped his
board, took the napkin from his girlfriend and calmly held it up to
the photographers and television camera operators waiting in the
finish area.
``I think the Olympics are good for snowboarding, but I don't
think this whole deal is,'' he said.
``Marijuana is not a performance-enhancing drug, and Ross did
not smoke it; he was just subjected to it,'' he added. ``Marijuana
is present in every sport. If it happens to be more present in
snowboarding, it may be just because it's a younger generation. A
lot of us do not smoke it, but I'm not denying that a lot of my
friends do. You're not going to change a friend because they do.''
Michalchuck was not the only Canadian to take an activist
stance.
``In the spirit of snowboarders, we're not going to sit down on
this,'' said Mark Fawcett, one of Rebagliati's fellow giant- slalom
riders. ``We're going to try to take the scar and put it back on
the IOC. To come right back at them.''
Cara-Beth Burnside of the United States said: ``Everyone was
furious. Everyone was, like, Ross won the gold, no matter what. It
wasn't anything that was affecting his performance. I mean, come
on, they're kicking people out for cough medicine.''
Others were more circumspect. ``Well, marijuana is on the
list,'' said Norwegian Anne Molin Kongsgaard, who added that the
disqualification was ``very sad.''
Some riders also expressed dismay that after waiting for years
to show their moves in the Olympics, this issue was now much more
interesting to the world than whether they had just performed a
McTwist.
``It's a weird day,'' said the Canadian team spokesman, Paul
Rivard. ``Because the riders know everybody wants to talk about
something other than their run, and they want to stay focused.''

The rain that began falling just before the start of the women's
qualifying run certainly did not do much to lighten the mood. Nor
did the Olympic organizers' questionable decision to allow a
relatively small number of fans access to the area bordering the
halfpipe. The bulk of the several thousand fans were instead
relegated to a field far down the slope, their view of the halfpipe
obstructed by television booths.
``Usually everybody is right up next to it,'' said Adam Merriman
of Vail, Colo., who traveled to Japan to watch his girlfriend,
Barrett Christy, compete in the halfpipe. ``But then usually there
aren't this many television cameras or people around, either. So I
guess that's good.''
The teen-age and twentysomething Japanese fans who lined the
front row of the roped-off field did not seem to mind their poor
seats. Snowboarding is in fashion with Japan's trend-conscious
youth, and there was no shortage of baggy pants, Airwalk boots and
dyed orange hair.
