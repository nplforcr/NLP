WASHINGTON _ Following are excerpts from a letter to the
independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, by President Clinton's personal
lawyer, David Kendall, as provided by Kendall:
``The leaking by your office has reached an intolerable point.
The covert dissemination of both accurate and inaccurate
information by your staff violates Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules
of Criminal Procedures, case law, Department of Justice guidelines,
rules of court and well-established ethical prohibitions. At your
press conference yesterday, you paid lip service to your legal and
ethical obligations, remarking that you could not respond
concerning the status of `someone who might be a witness' because
`that goes to the heart of the grand jury process.' ...
``Events of recent days make a mockery of your earnest verbal
professions. Far more accurate is your candid recognition that, `I
regret that there have been instances, so it would appear, when
that rule has not been abided by.' `So it would appear' hardly does
justice to the deluge of leaks which quite obviously stem from your
office. In the past four years, I have written you in confidence
about the various leaks that have occurred from your office. I am
making this letter public today because of the calculated tactic
your office is now employing of selectively releasing both
information  &UR; and falsehoods, &LR;  in an attempt to pressure,
manipulate, intimidate witnesses and possible witnesses, affect
public opinion in your favor and cause political harm to the
President. I intend to seek judicial relief from these tactics,
including contempt sanctions, as soon as practicable, under Rule 6
(e), Barry v. United States, 865 F.2d 1317 (D.C. Cir. 1989), and
other available legal doctrines.
``The appalling disregard for the legal and ethical requirements
of grand jury and investigative confidentiality and the cynical
dissemination of information and misinformation from your office
leads me to believe that you have lost control. These leaks are
deeply unfair and prejudicial. You have a solemn duty to ferret out
these leaks and regain command and control of your staff. The leaks
erode a fundamental and venerable principle of the grand jury (an
investigative body enshrined in the Bill of Rights to the
Constitution) that investigations shall be conducted in secret so
that those suspected but not charged with crimes will not have
their reputations besmirched, without having a forum in which to
cleanse those reputations.
``A report on Wednesday's NBC Nightly News illustrates, however,
what is now commonplace _ legally protected grand jury material
strategically leaked from your office. Matters have gotten so out
of hand that NBC's report on the immunity negotiations between your
office and Ms. Lewinsky looks very much like an independent counsel
press release. In the space of three paragraphs, the NBC
correspondent refers directly at least four times to `sources' in
your office. For example, she states that `sources in Starr's
office have told NBC news that the information Lewinsky's lawyers
were offering was simply not enough' and that ``sources in Starr's
office believe the ((talking points)) instructions came from the
White House.
``Perhaps more pernicious even is a leak two days ago to The
Wall Street Journal, purporting to recount the grand jury testimony
of a White House steward, Mr. Nelvis. We now know that the leak _
attributed to `two individuals familiar with his testimony,' which
is obviously a narrow group centered in your office _ is `totally
false.' Yet the report was nonetheless spread widely as though
true, and was extremely damaging both to the President and Mr.
Nelvis. It also broadcast to the world the kind of evidence you
would like to gather, inviting copycat `testimony' and the like.
That's a dangerous and destructive game to play in an alleged
search for the truth. It's why these investigations must be
conducted in secret and why the leaks must stop.
``Today's news reports offer more of the same. A front-page
article in today's New York Times is headlined `Aide's Statements
Are Said to Differ From President's,' and the passive voice tells
all. The article, a flagrant leak from your staff, purports to
report what the President's personal secretary, Ms. Betty Currie,
has told `investigators'  &UR; (i.e. your agents), &LR;  and these statements
are sourced to `lawyers familiar with her account'  &UR; (i.e. your
legal staff) &LR; . This combination is repeated throughout the article:
``Paragraph 1: `President Clinton's personal secretary has told
investigators ... according to lawyers familiar with her account.'
``Paragraph 4&AMP;5: `Mrs. Currie has told investigators ... the
lawyers said. The lawyers also said. ...'
``Paragraph 6: `Mrs. Currie has told investigators ... the
lawyers said.'
``Paragraphs 12 &AMP; 17: `Mrs. Currie has been extensively
interviewed by agents and prosecutors from Mr. Starr's office. ...
According to the account provided by the lawyers, Mrs. Currie said.
...'
``And so on. Mrs. Currie's own lawyer has stated that, except
for the one sentence statement explicitly attributed to him in the
article, this information did not come from Mrs. Currie or her
attorneys. In context, the `lawyers familiar with the inquiry,' so
frequently quoted in the article, are plainly members of your
staff.
``The NBC report, The Wall Street Journal account and today's
New York Times article are not anomalies. Over the past two weeks,
there have been numerous such selective leaks directly traceable to
your office _ the accuracy of which, I might add, are often highly
suspect. ...
``As I have repeatedly pointed out previously in my letters over
the past four years, and as you must be aware, it is illegal and
wrong to attempt to manipulate witnesses and possible witnesses,
the press, the public and our system of justice by selectively
leaking information _ accurate or otherwise. Rule 6(e) of the
Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the ABA Standards for Criminal
Justice Relating to Prosecution Function and Fair Trials, the
National Prosecution Standards published by the National District
Attorneys Association, and the Rules of Professional Conduct for
the District of Columbia, among other professional codes of
conduct, all forbid leaks of purported confidential information of
the kind that have sprung from your office. ...
``The public disclosure of grand jury and investigative
information not only violates Rule 6(e) (2), it runs afoul of
ethical and professional standards of conduct for attorneys,
prosecutors, and executive branch officials. The ABA Standards for
Criminal Justice relating to the Prosecution Function provide that
`((a)) prosecutor should not make or authorize the making of an
extrajudicial statement that a reasonable person would expect to be
disseminated by means of public communication if the prosecutor
knows or reasonably should know that it will have a substantial
likelihood of prejudicing a criminal proceeding.' ...
``Well, first of all, The Associated Press is reporting tonight
that Ken Starr's office has rejected an immunity deal put forward
by Monica Lewinsky's lawyers, and sources in Starr's office have
told NBC News that the information Lewinsky's lawyers were offering
was simply not enough. ... The two sides aren't even on the same
page. They don't rule out an eventual deal, but they say right now
Starr wants to focus on accelerating his investigation.
``And NBC News has learned more about another critical piece of
evidence. A memo first discovered by Newsweek that Linda Tripp
claims was given to her by Monica Lewinsky. The memo appears to be
instructions on how to lie to Paula Jones's attorneys in her suit
against the President. Page one of the talking points obtained by
NBC weeks ago, was written, according to experts, in a semi-legal
language which would be unusual to come from a 24-year-old. The
second two pages, obtained by NBC today, are less formal, as if
they could be notes _ more instructions to Tripp on what to say to
help the White House. In one passage, the notes suggest that Tripp
should ignore her own lawyer's advice. `He has been saying you
should look neutral. Better for credibility,' it reads, `that you
aren't neutral.'
``Sources in Starr's office and close to Linda Tripp say they
believe the instructions came from the White House. If true, that
could help support a case of obstruction of justice. But sources
also tell NBC News Lewinsky has not agreed to discuss any of that
with Starr. And some of the additional language in the second two
pages of the memo is Pentagon jargon. That indicates that Lewinsky,
who had worked at the Pentagon, could have at least had a hand in
crafting the memo. One theory, Lewinsky wrote it on her computer,
but with the help of someone else, most likely a lawyer. Sources
say that's one reason why Ken Starr seized Lewinsky's computer. And
they also tell us from Starr's office that they figure the most
corroborating evidence they gather, either that helps their case
against the president, or it will help eventually make a better
deal with Monica Lewinsky.''
