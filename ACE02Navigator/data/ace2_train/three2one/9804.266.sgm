The Clinton administration and members of Congress yesterday vowed to pass
strong anti-tobacco legislation even though the tobacco industry walked out
of the legislative process last week and threatened to fight such a bill in
court.

Tobacco companies said last Wednesday that the June 1997 settlement
proposal reached with state attorneys general was "dead" and they were
abandoning attempts to craft legislation based on that deal.

Despite the walkout, "We will get bipartisan legislation this year," Health
and Human Services Secretary Donna E. Shalala declared on NBC's "Meet the
Press" yesterday. "There's no question about it because it's about public
health."

Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who sponsored the leading tobacco bill in
Congress, said on CBS's "Face the Nation," "I'm optimistic that we can get
this done by this summer." Noting that the White House and public health
advocates have complained that his bill isn't tough enough while the
industry has said it cannot live with his bill, McCain said, "I think we
may be well-positioned."

Office of Management and Budget Director Franklin D. Raines, on ABC's "This
Week," said it was regrettable that the industry withdrew from the
legislative process. "We think they should come back, but no one is going
to beg them," Raines said.

Representatives of the industry yesterday stepped up their attacks on the
McCain bill, which they say is far more financially punishing to the
industry and affords it less protection from lawsuits than the settlement
tobacco companies reached last year.

The McCain bill would raise tobacco taxes by $ 1.10 per pack. But J. Philip
Carlton, the lead industry attorney negotiating tobacco legislation with
the White House and Congress, said that in practice, the McCain bill would
increase per-pack cigarette costs to $ 5, which would lead to greatly
increased black market sales of cigarettes and youths' "buying their
cigarettes from drug dealers." Carlton, who said some 2 million
tobacco-related jobs would be endangered by the bill, declared that the
industry would challenge the McCain bill in court if it is enacted.

The McCain bill would bankrupt tobacco companies, Philip Morris senior vice
president Steven C. Parrish warned on both "Meet the Press" and "Face the
Nation." "We cannot sit down and agree to do things that will end up
putting us out of business," he said on NBC.

Some industry analysts, such as Martin Feldman of Smith Barney, have said
the McCain bill would bankrupt tobacco companies, especially debt-ridden R.
J. Reynolds. But Jeffrey Harris, an MIT professor who studies the economics
of the tobacco industry, disagreed. "So far I haven't been able to find a
substantiation of why it would go bankrupt," Harris said in an inter view.
"Any penalty imposed on the industry is going to be passed on to consumers
in the form of higher prices."

Harris said the price increases would cause consumption and industry
profitability to decline. But he said the losses at each of the
multinational tobacco conglomerates could be offset to some degree by their
non-tobacco businesses and international sales of tobacco products. "What I
haven't been able to figure out yet is how any analyst is somehow getting
from moderate or even marked declines in domestic market profitability
translating into bankruptcy," Harris said, suggesting that even Reynolds
could deal with its debt load by the usual corporate belt-tightening tools,
including lower dividend payouts to shareholders.

Representatives of the industry also were asked whether last week's walkout
was a bluff or part of a long-term plan. A December 1997 memorandum
prepared for the industry by a consultant -- the Bozell Sawyer Miller Group
-- outlined an "exit" strategy for the industry.

The memo called for an aggressive public education campaign in support of
the 1997 deal, in which the industry agreed to pay $ 368 billion over 25
years and accept restrictions to curb youth smoking in return for
protection against major lawsuits. But the memo suggested that if things
did not go well for tobacco companies, the industry could argue that it
"made a legitimate offer and the politicians played politics and made a
mess of it." The McCain bill would increase costs to the industry by about
40 percent -- to $ 516 billion over the next 25 years -- and would not give
the companies as much legal protection.

Asked whether the industry was "just walking out in order to get a better
deal," Carlton responded, "Absolutely not!

"The process in Washington has gotten completely out of control," he said.
"It's gone from what once was a noble purpose of reducing youth smoking and
use of other tobacco products to a process now that has only to do with big
taxes, big government and big brother. And we're not bluffing."
