RAMALLAH, West Bank, Feb.9-
 


Five months after Washington and Bogota reached an agreement allowing renewal of 
U.S. aid to Colombia's military, its army has received no funding because it has 
failed to provide U.S. officials with information that would enable units using 
the aid to be purged of suspected human rights abusers. 

The agreement, signed Aug. 1, permits the United States to supply ammunition, 
vehicles, and communication and navigational equipment to the military. They 
were to be used to fight drug trafficking in a specific geographic area that 
includes most of the southern half of the country. But because of the army's 
poor human rights record in the past decade, the United States made its help 
conditional on the Colombian military's human rights performance and established 
a joint vetting process for units receiving the aid. 

The agreement says the Colombian government is to provide semiannual 
certification to the U.S. Embassy "regarding any ongoing formal investigations 
or prosecutions, or any penalties applied, with respect to gross violations of 
human rights by any member of the units operating in the designated area." 

The aid was expected to total about $ 37 million in fiscal 1998, but U.S. 
officials said the delays in designating and vetting the units could mean less 
aid would be disbursed. 

Aid to the Colombian military was formally cut off in 1996, after the U.S. 
government, for the second year in a row, said Colombia had failed to cooperate 
fully in fighting drug trafficking. The second failure to be certified triggered 
the cutoff, but President Clinton issued a waiver allowing aid to resume after 
an agreement was reached on how and where it would be used. 

Colombia is one of the world's most violent countries. Guerrillas in the 
longest-running Marxist insurgency in the hemisphere are battling the army, as 
well as the right-wing paramilitary organizations that it often tolerates. All 
sides are involved, to varying degrees, in the lucrative drug trade. 

According to news service reports, at least 24 people were killed yesterday and 
Thursday in attacks by guerrillas and paramilitaries. 

Guerrillas reportedly attacked a remote police post in the northern province of 
Magdalena, killing two policemen, a 3-year-old girl and a 17-year-old boy. A 
guerrilla was also reported killed. And in a rash of four attacks in the 
northwest, paramilitary groups killed nine people, the reports said. 

While U.S. aid to Colombia is supposed to fight drug trafficking, the military 
can use it in areas where the leftist guerrillas are active. The likelihood that 
U.S. funds would be used for the counterinsurgency campaign made the 
U.S.-Colombian agreement controversial within the administration. 

The navy and air force -- unlike the army -- moved quickly to name and vet their 
units, and have received several million dollars in aid, according to U.S. 
government officials. But most of the aid was to go to the army. Officials said 
they were unable to determine exactly how much money had gone to the navy and 
air force. 

"The army is not adequately vetting its units at this time," said a U.S. 
official monitoring the aid. "They did give us a list of units to receive aid, 
but it was so confused, we had to send it back to them and ask them to clean it 
up. That was just before Christmas, and we hope to hear back from them soon." 

Another U.S. official said the Colombian army had difficulty finding any units 
without serious human rights violations, thus slowing the process. 

"The question is, is there anyone we can deal with out there?" the official 
asked. "There are so many problems; it is very complicated." 

Fidel Cano, a spokesman for the Colombian Embassy here, acknowledged the delays 
in compiling the army's information but said putting together such data as who 
belongs to what unit and which human rights investigations are underway is 
complicated. 

"Our Ministry of Defense is working very hard with the U.S. Embassy in Bogota to 
get the information together," Cano said. "We are giving it a high priority; it 
is not something that we have forgotten."
