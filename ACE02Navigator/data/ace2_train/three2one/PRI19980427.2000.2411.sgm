 Another chapter of history that began during world war two is also being
 written today. A Japanese court this morning ruled that Tokyo should
 compensate three South Korean women who were forced to provide sex to
 Japanese soldiers during the war. The sum is small, a little over two thousand dollars,
 to each of the women. But the symbolism is enormous. Up to now, the Japanese government
 has refused to pay direct compensation to the so-called comfort women. Instead
 setting up a private fund to offer reparations. But today the judge ruled
 that Tokyo had neglected its legal duty to repair the comfort women's anguish.
 The BBC's Juliette Hindle is in Tokyo. Juliette, on the one hand today's decision has
 been hailed as a precedent. On the other, it's being condemned by some women's groups.
 Why is that?

<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="2455.104" endTime="2488.913">
 Well it is a breakthrough in many senses because up until now as you mentioned,
 the Tokyo courts have always ruled in favor of the government. But it now
 appears that they are truly independent and there had been some doubts about that.
 But the reason why it's also being regarded as dissatisfactory is that it's a
 very paltry sum involved, much less than the women were actually asking for.
 But also it's slightly reluctantly given in some senses. And the government has um
 already said that it's likely to appeal and that it's very disappointed
 with the court result.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="2488.913" endTime="2502.657">
 An- and the amount we're talking about is two thousand two hundred seventy-two dollars.
 uh th- the Japanese government has admitted that these women were forced into sexual
 slavery. But it has always avoided paying any kind of compensation. What's the
 reasoning behind their refusal?
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="2502.657" endTime="2533.329">
 The whole issue of Japan's war past is incredibly sensitive and very difficult
 for politicians here to deal with. On the one hand, there's a growing body
 of people who think Japan should face up to its past. But there's still a
 very influential group of people who believe that Japan acted in a completely
 justifiable way given that uh- it was a time of war. So it's not a simple issue
 here. But there are plenty of people who do think the government is acting in a
 very anachronistic way.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="2533.329" endTime="2544.264">
 Maybe that would also shed some light on the issue of the apology. Cou- could you
 explain Japan's reluctance to formally apologize for forcing these people to act
 as comfort women? What is behind that?
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="2544.264" endTime="2572.005">
 Well, for many years Japan didn't admit to the existence of these wartime
 brothels where women were forced into prostitution for the pleasure of
 Japanese military. um It was not until nineteen ninety-three that the government
 officially said some of these women had been forced against their will to work in
 these places. So, it's taken that long to get through that barrier of shame or discomfort
 with atrocities that happened in the past.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="2572.005" endTime="2579.684">
 I wonder if also there's an issue of of th- the weight of public apology and how
 it's viewed in Japan as opposed to someplace like here in America.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="2579.684" endTime="2611.238">
 I think there is a very different attitude to what happened in the past.
 And, of course, many people here still have relatives, grandfathers, uncles
 and so on who took part in these atrocities. So if the whole nation then turns
 around and apologizes for what those elders did, um they're really saying that
 those people ar- are not fit to be part of their society. And it's very
 difficult for Japan to reject this whole group. I think it would take a- at least
 another generation for Japan to get over its complex about what happened in the
 war.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="2611.238" endTime="2622.667">
 And some of the women who were forced to work in brothels, they are much older
 now as well, seventy-nine, eighty years old in some cases, but they seem vehement
 about the issue of restitution. What what does it seem uh that they want?
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="2622.667" endTime="2637.751">
 What they're really campaigning for is a dignified apology so that their
 suffering is not forgotten. So that they are honored for the, the awful things
 that they had to undergo in a situation that nobody hopes will be repeated.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="2637.751" endTime="2647.846">
 And some of them are speaking out now about the compensation that has been
 offered. And apparently women's groups are working to pass a law that would
 set the stage for paying compensation to all uh th- the comfort women.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="2647.846" endTime="2669.757">
 Yes. As many as two hundred thousand women across Asia were forced into prostitution.
 Nobody's really sure how many of those are still alive. And as the years go
 by, it obviously becomes a smaller number. I think really Japan needs to
 act soon to be able to assuage this guilt. Because soon the people who can
 talk about what happened won't be around anymore.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="2669.757" endTime="2676.753">
 With that kind of pressure, do you think that these women will uh ever get a
 formal apology from the government?
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="2676.753" endTime="2706.647">
 I think it's very unlikely that they will see a national government of
 Japan stand up and apologize for everything that took place in the second world
 war. Just think, over the last fifty-three years, they've managed to avoid doing that.
 There've been various different prime ministers with various different political
 backgrounds and they've all avoided doing it. They offer half way apologies and
 individual apologies. But a national apology, I don't think we'll see it in the lifetime
 of most of the comfort women.
