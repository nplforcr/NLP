UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ Nearly five years ago, when the Islanders
drafted right wing Todd Bertuzzi in the first round and defenseman
Bryan McCabe in the second, the plan was to rebuild the
organization around them, as well as other talented young players.
But that vision will not be realized. In a move that left one
player teary-eyed and the other one rattled, the Islanders Friday
traded McCabe, the team's 22-year-old captain, and Bertuzzi, a
23-year-old underachiever, along with a 1998 third-round draft
pick, to the Vancouver Canucks. In exchange, the Islanders received
Trevor Linden, the marquee forward General Manager Mike Milbury had
sought for months.
The trade came hours before a midnight deadline imposed by the
National Hockey League as part of a freeze over the next two and a
half weeks as many of the National Hockey League's players compete
at the Winter Olympics.
With the Islanders struggling to score goals this season, the
opportunity to acquire Linden, a 27-year-old two-time All-Star and
former captain of the Canucks, was simply too good for Milbury to
pass up, no matter the asking price.
''It's a big trade,'' Coach Rick Bowness said. ''It's a tough
trade, too. You're losing a couple of young guys in Bryan and Todd.
But if you want a player like Trevor Linden, you have to give up
something. Obviously, we are excited. He will be good for us.''
Linden has struggled in each of the last two seasons, suffering
injuries to both knees.
He said Friday evening by telephone that he had resumed skating
with the Canucks Friday morning and planned to play for the
Canadian Olympic team. Linden, a right wing who also plays center,
will not play for the Islanders on Saturday against the Devils at
Nassau Coliseum.
A 10-year veteran of the Canucks, Linden enjoyed his best season
in 1995-96 when he recorded 33 goals and 47 assists. He has 247
goals and 302 assists in 702 career games.
In addition to the injuries, Coach Mike Keenan's public
criticisms also made Linden unhappy. He was also upset after Mark
Messier replaced him as captain of the Canucks after Messier
arrived as a free agent at the start of the season.
McCabe was teary-eyed after he received news of the trade.
Walking slowly down the hallway between the visitor and home-team
dressing rooms at Nassau Coliseum, he went into the Islanders'
room, stopped to speak to Bertuzzi for a moment, then collected his
personal items from his stall.
''I was shocked,'' McCabe said outside the Islanders' dressing
room. ''I'm more sad than anything. I've been with these guys for
three years. I don't want to leave the boys.''
Bertuzzi sounded more optimistic. ''Things weren't working out
here,'' said Bertuzzi, who had a disappointing seven goals and 11
assists in 52 games with the Islanders. ''I'm a little rattled, but
looking forward to the new start, nothing but good things.''
