 A very strange story about a murder confession appeared today on the front
 page of The New York Times. It is certainly a prominent place for a news
 story to be displayed. But the confession in question, by a man to
 murdering his five year old daughter, appeared even before that on the
 Internet.
 We are going to take A Closer Look tonight because the man
 actually confessed to murder while he was online talking to and, in this
 case, sharing some of his most personal secrets with people who only knew
 him through his keyboard.
 First, from ABC's Aaron Brown, the story of how the murder was
 revealed.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="893.568" endTime="946.183">
 For three years, the seventeen hundred residents of Bowman, North Dakota, didn't even
 suspect a murder had been committed in their town. Five year old Amanda
 Froistad's death in a fire at her father's home was ruled an accident. And
 it would have stayed that way had her father, Larry, not allegedly
 confessed to setting the fire.
 His purported confession was e-mailed over the Internet to fellow
 members of a problem drinkers support group. Froistad wrote, I let her
 watch the videos she loved all evening. And when she was asleep, I got
 wickedly drunk, set our house on fire, went to bed, listened to her scream
 twice. Hearing her wheeze in the smoke I could barely stand, looking at
 her bedroom door burning. These are things I can't forget.
 Two hundred members of the group received the message, including
 Elisa DeCarlo in Manhattan.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="946.183" endTime="949.744">
 And I screamed. That was my first reaction.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="949.744" endTime="971.740">
 But judging from their e-mails, most others in the group didn't know what
 to think or what to do. Wrote group leader Frederick Rogers
 , a Rutgers
 university psychologist, We have two responsibilities here, to ourselves
 as members of this community and to the larger community beyond. Rogers
 did not call police and questions whether others should have.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="971.740" endTime="977.045">
 I had no way of knowing for sure whether w- uh what he was saying was true.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="977.045" endTime="1004.072">
 Rogers and others decided therapy would be best. Wrote group member Kay,
 I
 don't think this group is enough. What a very painful thing in many, many
 ways.
<time sec="986.782">
 And others were simply frustrated at the turn their support group
 had taken. Wrote one member, Can we please talk about drinking? I need
 your help here.
 Only a handful of people who read Froistad's chilling words called
 police. Jim Shirk in Bremerton, Washington, was one of them.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1004.072" endTime="1014.125">
 It surprises me that so many saw it differently, and so few uh felt the way I
 did. That that surprises me and really saddens me.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1014.125" endTime="1031.793">
 Still, the case strongly suggests that many people have come to believe
 their most personal e-mail communications are both private and
 confidential.
 And that's something the law doesn't allow and the open nature of the
 Internet cannot possibly provide. Aaron Brown, ABC News, New York.

 We were somewhat surprised today that so many members of Larry Froistad's
 support group were so openly reluctantly to think of him as a criminal or
 to
 turn him in. And it made us wonder, yet again, whether cyberspace is
 encouraging a whole new culture to develop.
 There are certainly the makings of a new language. The people who
 take part in these group discussions are said to post what they're
 thinking.
 And so, they're posters. Those who only listen are lurkers.
<time sec="1057.391">
 Over time, the group may become a virtual family. All families
 argue, of course. And if you raise your voice in cyberspace argument, you
 type in capital letters. That is shouting on the Internet.
 When you insult another person, you are said to have flamed them.
 You can apologize with an emoticon, an emotional expression made by
 combining symbols on the keyboard. It actually looks more familiar to many
 of us when you actually put it this way.
<time sec="1086.509">
 But is there a different mindset on the Internet? We have been
 talking to Dr. Kimberly Young, who specializes in neuropsychology,
 including something called Internet addiction disorder.
 Dr. Young, is the Internet and these groups really a special place with a
 different culture, or are they just like the rest of us?
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1104.849" endTime="1137.034">
 Well, on one hand, the Internet does reflect, I think, a lot of what
 society
 represents. On the other hand, it it does have a culture all of its own, its
 own separate language. What's interesting is that what might take you and
 I
 months or years to develop an intimate relationship may only take days or
 weeks online.
 Um the fact that you're anonymously communicating with other people
 uh allows you sort of the freedom of expression that goes deeper than sort of
 face-to-face communication. So subjectively, people feel quite intimate
 online in just a matter of days.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1137.034" endTime="1138.652">
 But confessing to murder?
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1138.652" endTime="1164.786">
 Well, many times people find this sort of safe behind the safety behind the computer
 screen.
 They find that um in general it seems that they can say things, and often times
 I find people forget that they're talking to other real people. It's sort
 of like journaling in a notepad, but an electronic one where other people
 are are reading what you're writing. So sometimes that compels us to say
 things we normally wouldn't say or to be more uninhibited online.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1164.786" endTime="1166.950">
 Well, Dr. Young, in real life, you're very helpful.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1166.950" endTime="1168.316">
 Well, thank you very much.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1168.316" endTime="1176.49">
 Thank you very much.
 Larry Froistad, the man who got us thinking about all this today,
 will be arraigned tomorrow in North Dakota on charges of murder.
