 President Clinton presented his childcare proposal today
 calling for nearly twenty-two billion dollars to help working parents find
 quality care for their children.
 The plan would give childcare tax breaks to parents and
 businesses and provide more money for states and programs that
 train and supervise caregivers.
 The President says his plan would extend subsidized childcare
 to about two million American children.
