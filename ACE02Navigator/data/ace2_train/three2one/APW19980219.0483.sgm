	   PARIS (AP) _ France expressed optimism Thursday about U.N.
Secretary General Kofi Annan's visit to Baghdad, with the Foreign
Ministry saying a diplomatic solution was still possible.
	   Annan is expected to arrive in Paris early Thursday evening for
meetings with French President Jacques Chirac and Foreign Minister
Hubert Vedrine before leaving for Iraq on Friday morning.
	   ``We will reiterate our support for the Secretary General's
mission, which should lead to a diplomatic solution of the
crisis,'' French Foreign Ministry spokesman Yves Doutriaux told a
regular news briefing Thursday.
	   France has cautioned the United States against leading a
military strike against Baghdad in the belief that Saddam Hussein
may still back down and agree to unrestricted access for U.N.
weapons inspectors to all sites.
	   Chirac was expected to stress to Annan that France wants a
peaceful solution to the crisis. Unlike Britain, France has not
contributed to a buildup of Western forces in the Persian Gulf.
	   France's interior minister, an outspoken critic of U.S. policy
in the Gulf, has criticized what he called ``American diplomacy's
will for war'' and said the United States should have shown such
resolve during World War II.
	   Under U.N. resolutions following the 1991 Gulf War that followed
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, Baghdad must destroy its biological,
chemical and nuclear weapons programs before a U.N. trade embargo
can be lifted.
