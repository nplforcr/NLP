ROOSEVELT, N.Y. _ A Long Island school administrator known as a
problem solver has been named to head a state panel struggling with
the task of reforming the troubled Roosevelt School District, the
first ever to be taken over by the state.
The state Board of Regents appointed Dr. Anthony J. Pecorale,
who has served as superintendent of several Long Island school
districts, to be chairman of a three-member panel that will
exercise state authority over Roosevelt schools through the year
2000.
Pecorale succeeded Dr. Daniel Domenech, the former
superintendent of the Western Suffolk Board of Cooperative
Educational Services, who resigned several months ago to become
superintendent of schools in Fairfax County, Va. His departure,
which followed several disputes with Roosevelt officials over
budgetary matters and the direction of the 2,800-student school
district, came at a crucial midpoint in the five-year takeover
effort.
The takeover of the district's six schools was ordered in
January 1996 by the Board of Regents, which cited poor academic
performance by a disproportionate number of Roosevelt students,
lack of textbooks, poor sanitary conditions and buildings in
disrepair and in violation of fire safety laws.
Although the fire violations and many of the other problems have
been addressed over the last few years, disputes within the
community have hampered the local school board from functioning
effectively and continue to threaten progress.
Of immediate concern is a dispute over whether the district
should condemn its 70-year-old Washington-Rose Elementary School.
The district operates on a tight $33.3 million budget, which was
approved after much debate and community resistance last year.
Pecorale said he was prepared to address Roosevelt's problems
quickly. He said his first priority was to consult with community
leaders before making any decisions.
``I have high expectations for the school district and my No. 1
priority will be quality education for the students,'' he said. ``I
want to hear from the students as well as their parents and members
of the school board.''
