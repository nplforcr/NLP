England presses for tickets; warns of hooligan problems
</HEADLINE>

LONDON (AP) _ Government ministers, parliament members and
soccer officials pressed their demands Friday that England should
receive more tickets for this summer's World Cup in France to avoid
giving hooligans an excuse to cause trouble.
Sports Minister Tony Banks termed ``miserly'' the allocation of
only 9,128 tickets for England's first three games. Home Secretary
Jack Straw warned that demand would exceed supply even if the
allocation were doubled or tripled.
``The demand would still outstrip supply by a factor 100 or
1,000,'' Straw said, warning of danger if fans without tickets
swarm into France.
``What is absolutely critical is that we must not let this
controversy about the relatively low level of ticket allocation be
used as an excuse to justify... criminals and hooligans causing
trouble at the games,'' added Straw, the minister in charge of
policing.
Several other European countries _ Germany, Belgium, the
Netherlands and Denmark among them _ have had similar complaints
about France's ticketing policy, brought about by relatively small
stadiums and an increase of World Cup finalists from 24 to 32.
``This is making something of a mockery of a great footballing
festival,'' Banks said.
Twenty-two members of parliament also weighed in Friday with a
motion condemning ``the action of the French ticketing
authorities,'' terming it a breach of European Commission
regulations.
The motion calls on Prime Minister Tony Blair, serving in the
six-month rotating presidency of the European Union, ``to press for
swift punitive action and a proper allocation of tickets for
British fans hoping to attend this festival of football.''
The English Football Association has also asked soccer's world
governing body FIFA to press the French for more tickets.
``We will take this as far as we possible can,'' said FA
spokesman David Davies. ``At the moment our concern has gone to
FIFA General Secretary Sepp Blatter. We know there is deep concern
and that has been reflected in the telephone conversation we've had
right across Europe.''
Straw, speaking Friday at a roundtable on hooliganism and
security in the northern city of Blackburn, warned fans not to
travel to France without tickets.
``Despite what anyone claims _ no one has tickets, as they have
yet to be printed,'' Straw said.
Straw also pointed out that under French law, tickets are
invalid ``unless they are bought from an authorized agent.''
Under the current allocation, England will receive 3,790 tickets
for its opening match against Tunisia in Marseille on June 15;
2,749 for the game against Romania in Toulouse on June 22; and
2,589 for the match against Colombia in Lens on June 26.
The stadium capacity is 60,000 in Marseille, 37,000 in Toulouse
and 41,000 in Lens.
There are a total of 2.5 million tickets on sale for the 64
matches during the tournament.
Under FIFA's rules:
_ 65 percent of the tickets are sold in France, with priority to
the French soccer family.
_ 10 percent are sold to officially approved tour operators.
_ 5 percent are made available for purchase by official sponsors
and partners.
_ 20 percent are reserved for FIFA and the national
associations, with 80 percent of those going to the two countries
playing a match, on the basis of each team getting half.
