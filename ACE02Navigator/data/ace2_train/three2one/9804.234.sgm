 HONG KONG, April 16 (Thursday)

Pol Pot, the notorious yet enigmatic Khmer Rouge leader whose reign of
terror in Cambodia left more than 2 million people dead but who was later
denounced by his own movement, was reported by his former comrades to have
died peacefully in his sleep late Wednesday night at age 73.

In the last known film of him taken in July, a white-haired Pol Pot
appeared frail and sickly, suffering from malaria and unable to walk
without assistance. Since then, he has been under house arrest by the
colleagues he once commanded, even as their numbers have dwindled to a few
hundred because of defections and as their last jungle redoubt has become
encircled by Cambodian government troops about to finish off the guerrilla
movement and close off for good the bloodiest chapter in Cambodia's tragic
history.

If his death is confirmed, it would mark an anticlimactic end for one of
history's most ruthless human rights abusers. Just days ago, his capture by
Cambodian troops seemed certain, and Clinton administration officials were
heady with the prospects of bringing Pol Pot before an international
tribunal to answer for his crimes.

Today, however, officials in various capitals were seeking independent
confirmation that Pol Pot was indeed dead.

A Khmer Rouge official named Nuon Nou, who had been responsible for
guarding Pol Pot, informed Thai military officials early today of the death
of the group's disgraced leader. But by midday today, Thai officials in
Bangkok said they could not confirm that Pol Pot was dead without
independent verification, which might include photographs of the corpse or
else the actual body.

A Thai official said a military team was crossing the border into Cambodia
to try to confirm the report of Pol Pot's death. "If he is really dead,
presumably they would want to provide some evidence," the official said.
Noting that past reports of Pol Pot's death and his supposed retirement
from active leadership have proven untrue, the official, speaking by
telephone, said, "We've been through this before."

"It was a verbal report made by a Khmer Rouge official to our officers," he
said. "The field officers are of the view that it looks pretty valid. They
gave a lot of weight to it. But the central authorities here in Bangkok
have asked for any independent verification."

In Washington, State Department officials also said they had no independent
confirmation whether Pol Pot was dead.

In Phnom Penh, the Cambodian capital, news of Pol Pot's death was greeted
with caution and some skepticism, with officials also demanding to see the
body before believing the reports from the jungle.

There was some speculation that if Pol Pot were dead, his former colleagues
may have simply eliminated him to prevent Cambodian troops from capturing
him, or to avoid having to turn him over to an international tribunal whose
proceedings might have cast an unwelcome spotlight back on the Khmer
Rouge's bloody rule of Cambodia from April 1975 until 1979. "Maybe they
just got rid of him," one Thai Foreign Ministry official said.

In Phnom Penh, Khieu Kanarith, the government spokesman, demanded an
autopsy, saying, "We request whoever has his body to turn it over to the
government." He added, "There are a lot of coincidences here."

The Associated Press quoted the Khmer Rouge official, Nuon Nou, as denying
any foul play in Pol Pot's death, saying he died from heart problems. Nuon
Nou reportedly told the Associated Press by telephone that the guerrillas
had taken photographs of the corpse as evidence.

In a story based on interviews on April 11, American journalist Nate
Thayer, who last talked with Pol Pot in October, reported in the Far
Eastern Economic Review magazine that Nuon Nou and other hard-line Khmer
Rouge holdouts were ready to turn Pol Pot over to an international tribunal
but were uncertain whom to contact. Thayer suggested the guerrillas contact
the International Red Cross, according to the magazine account.

It was 23 years ago this week that Pol Pot's guerrillas, wearing what
became their trademark sandals, black pajama uniforms and red-checkered
scarves, marched into Cambodia's battered capital and declared the start of
"Year Zero," launching the most complete -- and brutal -- revolutionary
transformations of a society ever attempted. Taking a cue from China's
revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, Pol Pot put into practice an even more
extreme brand of Maoism, emptying the cities and forcing millions of
Cambodians into labor camps, abolishing all forms of money and currency,
shutting down schools and temples, and establishing an insidious
informants' network in which even children were asked to spy on parents.

As part of his "purification" campaign, foreigners were expelled from
Cambodia, and anyone suspected of being educated, middle-class or linked to
the old regime was tortured and executed. Cambodia's current government --
led by Hun Sen, who was first installed in power by a Vietnamese invasion
force in 1979 that ousted the Khmer Rouge -- has preserved evidence of
Khmer Rouge atrocities at a schoolhouse called Tuol Sleng, whose classrooms
had been converted into torture chambers under Pol Pot's rule.

After Vietnam's troops ousted Pol Pot, he led a guerrilla resistance
movement, with arms and assistance from China. Later, his guerrilla group's
clandestine radio station announced that Pol Pot had stepped down from
active leadership of the Khmer Rouge, a claim that few outsiders believed.

To the end, Pol Pot remained unrepentant, insisting that although he may
have made mistakes in power, "My conscience is clear."

"You can look at me, am I a savage person?" he asked Thayer in an interview
at the group's jungle base in Anlong Veng. "Everything I have done and
contributed is first for the nation and the people and the race of
Cambodia."
