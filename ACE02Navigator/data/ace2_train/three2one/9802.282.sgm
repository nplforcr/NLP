SALISBURY, Md., Feb. 10-
 


James A. Perdue, chairman of the poultry empire that bears his family's name, 
probably is best known for his appearances in television commercials selling 
chicken. But he finds himself in a new role these days, fending off charges that 
his industry is to blame for despoiling the Chesapeake Bay. 

The usually soft-spoken Perdue will travel to Annapolis on Wednesday to defend 
his industry at a House of Delegates hearing where lawmakers will take up plans 
to fight the toxic microbe Pfiesteria piscicida by threatening farmers with 
sanctions if they don't limit the amount of manure they use as fertilizer. 

In a rare hour-and-a-half interview here at Perdue Farms' corporate headquarters 
-- a rectangle of offices across the street from the farmhouse where his 
grandfather, Arthur Perdue, launched what is now the nation's second-largest 
poultry company 78 years ago -- the grandson scoffed at suggestions the bay is 
critically threatened. 

He accused Maryland officials of peddling bogus science in proclaiming that 
chicken manure is washing off the land and fueled last summer's outbreaks of 
pfiesteria. Mostly, he worried about the costs attached to legislation 
championed by Gov. Parris N. Glendening (D), which would force farmers to do 
something else with the chicken manure they now use as fertilizer. 

Glendening's bill is being offered at a time when poultry producers across the 
country are struggling with higher feed prices, sagging exports and competition 
from lower-priced beef. Perdue said circumstances in Maryland are particularly 
dire, because production costs here already are higher than in other regions of 
the country. He worried that Glendening's initiative could push his industry 
over the edge, forcing it to shift operations elsewhere. 

"There's a lot of fear and a lot of anxiety," he said. "If the farmer goes out 
of business here, we can't grow our chickens on the [Eastern] Shore. It's going 
to put our plants out of business on the Shore." 

While even the governor's economic development secretary has expressed concern 
that the state's business reputation may be on the line in the debate over 
pfiesteria, several trade analysts said talk of major poultry companies packing 
up and leaving probably is exaggerated. 

The integrators like Perdue that process and market the birds "aren't going to 
leave Maryland," said John C. Bierbusse, a food analyst with A.G. Edwards and 
Sons in St. Louis. "The fixed assets are in place, the growers are there. . . . 
You can't just pick up a processing plant and move it." 

But others worry the industry could phase out operations here, spending new 
capital in places where doing business is cheaper. "I'm not going to build or 
enlarge a plant here if I'm not going to be able to do business efficiently," 
said Leonard Teitelbaum, a food analyst at Merrill Lynch in New York. "I may 
keep my old ones, but I won't build any new ones." 

Maryland's poultry industry dates to the 1920s, when farmers who raised fruits 
and vegetables for sale in big cities such as Baltimore, Philadelphia and New 
York opted to add chicken-houses to supplement their income. The sideline has 
since matured into an industry that annually produces 300 million chickens worth 
more than $ 1 billion, exporting the birds as far as Russia and China. 

The Perdue family says it is descended from French Huguenots who landed near 
Assateague Island in the 17th century, subsisting on the timber trade for 
several centuries before turning to farming. Given such roots, the modern-day 
clan leader frowns at suggestions his family's profitability rests on the right 
to pollute the Chesapeake. He calls himself an environmentalist. "I drink water 
out of the ground here," said Perdue, who shares the penetrating gaze of his 
father, Frank Perdue, the man who made the company a household name with ads 
that bragged it took a tough man to make a tender chicken. "I fish in the bay 
with my son." 

James Perdue received a doctorate in fisheries from the University of 
Washington, before returning to Maryland and the family business in 1983. He 
said links between farm pollution and pfiesteria are merely "circumstantial," 
and he pilloried those who offer the microbe as evidence that the Chesapeake is 
in mortal danger. 

"This idea of the Chesapeake being a dying bay is ridiculous," he said. "The bay 
is in the process of being cleaned up." 

He was equally dismissive of Glendening's pfiesteria commission, headed by 
former governor Harry R. Hughes, which declared that curbing the flow of 
pollutants in animal manure into tributaries of the Chesapeake Bay was the most 
promising strategy against the toxic microbe. He called that finding "a nothing 
statement, a 'we-don't have-enough-facts' statement." 

Perdue especially was critical of Glendening's decision to pursue mandatory 
limits on fertilizers, rather than the voluntary program favored by his 
industry. He accused Glendening of opting "to punish farmers, when he ought to 
pat them on the back." 

"If the costs of any one thing goes up, you can't survive," he said.
