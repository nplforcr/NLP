NEW YORK _ Werner Herzog tells a real-life tall tale in ``Little
Dieter Needs To Fly,'' a documentary that describes enough
breakneck adventures for any action hero. But the swashbuckler who
is the film's subject, Dieter Dengler, mostly describes his
exploits from memory. Now a garrulous extrovert living a
comfortable life near San Francisco, he talks of extraordinary
early hardship and of the drive that sustained him. With a German
childhood seared by images of World War II, and with an American
military career that saw him shot down over Laos in 1966, he has
many a hair-raising story to tell.
But as often happens in Herzog's haunting documentaries, the
most interesting figure seems to be the one behind the camera.
Though Dengler is a practiced raconteur and has his story amply
illustrated here, it is Herzog's occasional meditations on his
subject that linger.
``As a child,'' the filmmaker says in voice-over, ``Dieter saw
things that made no earthly sense at all. Germany had been
transformed into a dreamscape of the surreal.'' Starkly poetic
images of wartime destruction accompany that observation. Aerial
shots of voluptuous explosions in the jungle amplify Herzog's idea
of what it must have been like for Dengler to be a fighter pilot:
``It all looked strange, like a barbaric dream.''
``Little Dieter Needs to Fly,'' which opens on Wednesday at the
Film Forum, is one of the filmmaker's least exotic works, but it
straightforwardly presents Dengler's eventful history. He speaks of
having, as a boy, torn wallpaper off bombed-out walls so that his
mother could cook it, since there were nutrients in the glue. He
shows the camera how, even now, memories of being in a
prisoner-of-war camp lead him to keep hundreds of pounds of
emergency provisions hidden under his house, just in case.
Returning to Southeast Asia with a camera crew (Herzog enlists
villagers and water buffalo to stand impassively before the camera
and provide atmosphere), Dengler describes his harrowing
experiences as a prisoner. ``They were just always thinking of
something to do to me,'' he says of his captors, from whom he
ultimately made a highly dramatic escape.
Dengler illustrates how to open handcuffs with a piece of wire,
tells of biting a snake in two, even shares a black-tie reunion
dinner with the helicopter pilot who finally rescued him. And in
light of his many ordeals, his pleasant chattiness begins to seem
the film's strangest aspect. As Herzog puts it: ``He hides behind
the casual remark that this was the fun part of his life.''
