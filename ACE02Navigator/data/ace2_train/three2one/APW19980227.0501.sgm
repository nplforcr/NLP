ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Three gunmen tossed two hand grenades
into the garden of a military outpost during a roll-call in
Istanbul on Friday after opening fire on a sentry, wounding 16
soldiers, reports said.
Leftist and Kurdish guerrilla groups phoning several media
organizations in Istanbul claimed responsibility for the assault.
The attack appeared to be the latest example of the
collaboration between the leftist Revolutionary People's Salvation
Party-Front and Kurdish guerrillas, who are fighting for autonomy
in Turkey's southeast.
The Anatolia news agency said the attackers fled the scene by a
car immediately after the attack at around 8 a.m. (0600 GMT) in
Gaziosmanpasa district, on the outskirts of Istanbul.
The injured, including an officer, were in stable condition,
private NTV television said.
The war between Kurdish guerrillas and government forces in
southeastern Turkey has killed 37,000 people since 1984.
