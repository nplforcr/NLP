Wheeeere's Johnny?
In the distant era known as Watergate, it was Carson who ruled.
Such was his cultural authority _ and restrained exercise of it _
that his belated inclusion of White House scandals in his
''Tonight'' show monologue was the certain sign that Richard Nixon
was through.
But Carson is retired now, and there's no stronger indication of
how much the world has changed than this week's news from the
Center for Media and Public Affairs: There have been more Leno and
Letterman gags about President Clinton's sex life, an average of 16
per show per night, than on any other topic in the center's 10-year
history of monologue monitoring. They're so tasteless that, as the
non-late-night comedy writer Larry Gelbart puts it, ''It couldn't
have been this bad in the last 10 minutes of the Roman Empire.''
And what difference has all the gags made? The raunchier they are _
and the raunchier the news that inspires them _ the higher Bill
Clinton's poll numbers.
Carson isn't the only essential compass we've lost on the waves
of dizzying scandal. Sam Ervin, the trust-inspiring chairman of the
Watergate hearings, is dead, and Fred Thompson, let alone Al
D'Amato, proved no reincarnation. Howard Baker, the senator who
demanded what the president knew and when he knew it, is now a
shill for the tobacco industry. Instead of the apolitical,
no-nonsense Watergate Judge Sirica, we have the partisan,
Malibu-bound Judge Starr.
For all the hand-wringing about how Clinton's alleged deeds have
supposedly debased the values, ethics and morals of the nation, who
in American public life has the standing to lead us to judgment of
him?
Not the celebrity clergy. Billy Graham, who never met an
embattled president to whom he did not grant absolution (Richard
Nixon included), turned up on Thursday to embrace Clinton at the
National Prayer Breakfast. Jesse Jackson is on the White House TV
spin team, providing reassuring bulletins from phone chats he's had
with the first daughter in Palo Alto. Jerry Falwell is a peddler of
crazy, hateful videos accusing the president of murder. That oily
paragon of big money and hypocritical political cynicism, Pat
Robertson, has so little credibility that you have to wonder if his
campaign to save Karla Faye Tucker hastened her execution.
The press? The many retracted Oralgate stories have taken their
toll; yesterday's Pew poll found that 63 percent of the public
dismisses news reports as ''often inaccurate.'' The
fire-and-brimstone broadcast preachers on Presidential morality
include the past-gate scoundrels G. Gordon Liddy and Oliver North _
as well as George Will, whose own elastic ethics allowed him to
coach Ronald Reagan for a 1980 debate while keeping his role a
secret from ABC News viewers to whom he then effused over Reagan's
performance.
Politicians? Very few have been heard from, and we know why.
Newt Gingrich, third in line for the presidency, was branded with
the scarlet A by the right-leaning New York Post three years ago,
when it gave its front-page imprimatur to allegations that he
''made whoopee'' on his office desk. Phil Gramm, who chastises
Clinton for having ''no bearings,'' was revealed in his '96
Presidential campaign to have invested in a soft-core movie called
''Beauty Queens.'' Some of the sternest Capitol Hill attacks on
Clinton's ''moral fiber'' have come from none other than Helen
Chenoweth, the Idaho congresswoman who publicly fed false
militia-spawned rumors of malevolent government helicopters in the
months before the Oklahoma City bombing.
No wonder Ralph Reed has now advised his fellow Republicans to
find ''someone who is beyond reproach personally'' to take on the
president _ a casting call that has had few takers beyond the
self-appointed national scold William Bennett. Nor have Democrats
done any better: they've found no above-the-fray leader who can
either defend or disown Clinton from an impartial, nonpartisan
moral plane. So far only Al Gore has even applied.
Thus does the fate of this White House hang, incredibly enough,
on the American people, who so far seem to be reserving judgment
and ignoring the pronouncements of press, clergy, politicians and
late-night comics alike. Moral fiber aside, democracy is on a roll.
