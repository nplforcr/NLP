BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Taking their search for weapons of mass
destruction close to President Saddam Hussein's hometown, U.N. arms
experts traveled to northern Iraq Saturday to inspect presidential
palace compounds.
A multinational group of 20 diplomats, mandated by a U.N.-Iraq
accord, accompanied the arms experts to the town of Tikrit, 25
kilometers (15 miles) west of Auja, the village where Saddam was
born on April 28, 1937.
``We had no reports of any problems at this stage,'' Ewen
Buchanan, the spokesman for the inspectors, said by telephone from
New York. ```They will continue with their schedule for the next
week and they are on schedule.''
Saddam has one palace in Tikrit, one at Jebel Makhul, a mountain
range some 50 kilometers (35 miles) north of Tikrit and one near
Tharthar lake, 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of Tikrit. It was
not immediately known which one of those the inspectors visited or
how long the inspection lasted.
State-run television on Saturday showed hundreds of villagers
shouting slogans of support for Saddam as he visited villages near
Tikrit.
In a speech, the Iraqi leader made no mention of the current
searches, which state-run media have also ignored.
The palaces are among the eight that Iraq had long kept
off-limits from weapons inspectors, citing national sovereignty.
When Iraq refused to relent, the United States and Britain
threatened military strikes, raising the specter of war in
February.
The crisis was averted when Iraq signed an accord with U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Feb. 23, pledging to open the
palaces. In return, the United Nations appointed the group of 20
diplomats to accompany the inspectors to all sensitive sites to
safeguard Iraq's dignity.
The palace inspections began Thursday with the Radwaniyah
complex outside Baghdad. The total area of the eight palace
compounds is 31.5 square kilometers (12.5 square miles), which
comprise 1,058 buildings.
The diplomats and the inspectors in Tikrit also are expected to
travel to Mosul, the site of another palace 400 kilometers (235
miles) from Baghdad during their three-day trip. They will return
to Baghdad on Monday.
Tikrit, 170 kilometers (105 miles) from Baghdad, is the
heartland of Iraq's ruling elite, which is dominated by minority
Sunni Muslims.
Earlier Saturday, the diplomats plus their leader, Jayantha
Dhanapala of Sri Lanka, drove from their downtown hotel to the U.N.
headquarters to team up with the arms experts at their office
before leaving for the north.
On Friday, a minor surveying problem snagged the inspection but
it was sorted out after talks between the U.N. team and Iraqi
Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz, Antonio Montiro, a Portuguese
diplomat, said.
``Everything went smoothly. Even when we had the problem, we
were able to talk. That's why things were solved,'' Montiro said.
The inspectors' leader, American Charles Duelfer, stressed that
it wasn't a significant problem.
The inspectors must certify that Iraq has dismantled its
long-range missile program and its programs to build chemical and
biological weapons before the U.N. Security Council will consider
lifting the economic sanctions it imposed after Iraq's 1990
invasion of Kuwait. The sanctions have strangled Iraq's economy.
Iraq has insisted that has complied with the U.N. resolutions
and that any banned weapons have been destroyed and the programs to
build them abolished.
