WASHINGTON _ Following are excerpts from the application by
Attorney General Janet Reno to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia for the appointment of an independent
counsel to investigate Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt's handling
of a gambling project by an American Indian tribe, as supplied by
the attorney general's office:
In accordance with the Independent Counsel Reauthorization Act
of 1994, I hereby apply for the appointment of an independent
counsel to investigate whether Bruce Babbitt, secretary of the
interior, committed a violation of ... law in his sworn testimony
on Oct. 30, 1997, before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee,
and to determine whether prosecution is warranted.
INFORMATION RECEIVED
On Oct. 14, 1997, the Department of Justice received media
reports that on Oct. 10, 1997, Secretary Babbitt had sent Sen. Fred
Thompson a letter concerning a July 14, 1995, decision to deny an
application by three Wisconsin Indian tribes to have the Interior
Department take land into trust for an off-reservation Indian
casino in Hudson, Wis. According to the news stories, Secretary
Babbitt's letter appeared to conflict with an Aug. 30, 1996, letter
that Secretary Babbitt had sent to Sen. John McCain on the same
matter.
Secretary Babbitt's apparently conflicting statements to the
senators concerned a remark that he allegedly made to a lobbyist,
Paul Eckstein, the day the application was denied. According to
sworn statements by Eckstein, when Eckstein asked for a delay in
the decision, Secretary Babbitt told Eckstein that Harold Ickes,
then White House deputy chief of staff, had ... directed him to
make a decision that day.
It was also alleged by Eckstein that Secretary Babbitt had
commented that Indian tribes opposed to the Hudson casino
application had contributed approximately half a million dollars to
the Democratic National Committee or other Democratic interests.
...
SCOPE OF JURISDICTION
The independent counsel shall have jurisdiction and authority to
investigate to the maximum extent authorized by the Independent
Counsel Reauthorization Act of 1994 whether Bruce Edward Babbitt,
secretary of the interior, committed a violation of any federal
criminal law, other than a Class B or C misdemeanor or infraction,
by making false statements during the course of congressional
testimony concerning a decision by the Department of Interior to
deny an application by three Indian tribes to take land into trust
in Hudson, Wis., for an off-reservation gambling casino or
conspiring with others to do so.
To the extent necessary to resolve the allegations that
Secretary Babbitt made false statements concerning this decision by
the Department of the Interior, the independent counsel shall have
jurisdiction and authority to investigate the decision itself to
determine whether any violation of federal criminal law occurred in
connection with the Department of Interior's consideration of the
application.
The independent counsel shall have jurisdiction to investigate
related allegations or evidence of any violation of federal
criminal law, other than a Class B or C misdemeanor or infraction,
by any individual or organization, as necessary to resolve the
matter described above.
The independent counsel shall have jurisdiction and authority to
investigate any violation of 28 USC 1826 or any obstruction of the
due administration of justice, or any material false statement or
testimony in violation of federal law. ...
The independent counsel shall have jurisdiction and authority to
seek indictments and to prosecute any persons or entities involved
in the matters described above who committed a violation of federal
criminal law arising out of such matters, including persons or
entities who have engage in an unlawful conspiracy or who have
aided or abetted any of the above described federal offenses.
