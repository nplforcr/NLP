NEW YORK _ It is a sprawling hotel ballroom with chandelier
lighting. And yet, it seemed as if Grant Hill had a bare light bulb
hanging over his head.
There was an interrogation of sorts Friday when the All-Stars
gathered for interviews, an inquiry into why Hill's fingerprints
were on the pink slip that was handed to Detroit Coach Doug Collins
earlier this week.
The suspect is popular, photogenic and as wholesome as a milk
mustache. But like the lavishly paid stars who flanked Hill's
table, he has influence over franchise decision-making and can
wield it like a lasso behind the scenes. He possesses the power to
remove someone with a firm tug.
``I still consider Doug a friend,'' said Hill, who was selected
to play in the All-Star Game Sunday at Madison Square Garden. ``I
don't know if he still considers me a friend. He probably blames me
for it. In his eyes, if I'd spoken up on his behalf he'd still be
there.''
A star's influence does not have to be overt. But just a few
tables from Hill, Orlando's Anfernee Hardaway, who demanded that
Magic Coach Brian Hill be fired last year, explained how his
marquee value helps his voice to stand out.
``If things are in your way of winning, whether it is a coach or
players that you think aren't doing their jobs, you have to speak
your opinion,'' Hardaway said. ``For Grant, it's not like no more
Mr. Nice Guy. It's speaking up when you have to speak up.''
That voice carries weight. It did not matter if Shawn Kemp was
viewed as a disruptive player in Seattle. When he complained about
not having a fair contract, when he demanded to be traded, his
moans were soothed. He was traded, given a raise and is Cleveland's
All-Star now.
``I think we do have a lot of power,'' said Seattle's Gary
Payton, who will start at point guard for the West All-Stars. ``We
can make a lot of things happen. When you're a key marquee player
on a team, and the NBA has hyped you up, and you make a lot of
money, yeah, you can make change.
``If you're not happy, and you think the coach is not giving you
the freedom to get loose so you can make your team win, a lot of
owners and general managers are going to listen to you. And they
are going to make the change. They'll look and see what's going on.
Yeah, you can get somebody removed. That's the way it's going right
now.''
More and more, star players are flaunting their leverage.
Hardaway has the Magic doing flips trying to please him. Hill was
fired, Chuck Daly was hired, and Julius Erving was added to
management to please Hardaway. The franchise does not want to lose
him to free agency after next year, knowing how costly it was when
another All-Star, Shaquille O'Neal, left two summers ago.
Not shy about asking, what Hardaway wants right now is for the
Magic to sign another All-Star ``to build around me.''
``I think the franchise players on a team should voice their
opinion about what they really want on a team,'' Hardaway said.
``It's not fair to the coaches sometimes, but sometimes the coaches
aren't fair to the players.''

Coaches are asking for larger deals, more power and increased
support from ownership in order to counter the star system that
caters to highly paid players.
And yet coaches still see the influence of players _ some just
twentysomething years old, some who are not even fundamentally
sound, some who do not understand salary cap restraints _ gathering
steam.
So how is a coach supposed to step lightly around their petulant
talent? How do they keep from coddling $100 million players who
need to be pushed without worrying about their job security?
``There are things that are disintegrating in our game, and the
power of the coach is probably one of those,'' said Seattle Coach
George Karl, who will coach the West All-Stars.
``If you don't have a situation lucrative to supporting the
coach, and a situation where it is very visible to the player that
the organization is supportive to the coach, it can be very
dangerous to that coach.''
But there are instances where the power of a player has helped a
coach. Michael Jordan said he would not play for any coach other
than Phil Jackson as last season ended. Despite a strained
relationship with management, Jackson was re-signed this summer for
one year at a $6 million salary.
It will be interesting to see if Jordan will be in Chicago next
season. Maintaining his support of Jackson, Jordan said again this
week that he will retire if Jackson does not return next season.
Again, Jordan has asserted his influence. Not so long ago, in a
much more subtle way, Jordan had something to do with Collins being
fired in Chicago.
So a star's power and influence is not new, just more obvious.
``I think he's very qualified and capable,'' Hill said of
Collins. ``It just didn't work out. I don't know what the average
life expectancy is for a coach in one place. I think it's
unfortunate that it didn't work out in Chicago and unfortunate that
it didn't in Detroit, but it was the right move to make.''
