WASHINGTON _ Following is a letter to President Clinton's
personal lawyer, David Kendall, by Whitewater independent counsel
Kenneth Starr, as provided by Starr's office:
Your letter of Feb. 6, 1998, accusing this office of improperly
disclosing information, including grand jury testimony, is strange
and inappropriate for three significant reasons. First, you elevate
mere suspicion to specific accusation without any facts other than
the press' often-misleading attributions of sources. Second, the
timing of your letter _ arriving in the midst of what appears to be
an orchestrated plan to deflect and distract this investigation _
undermines your expression of outrage. Third, we are aware that as
of several days ago, the President's defense attorneys had most, if
not all, of the material information (whether true or not) set
forth in today's New York Times article.
In my service as independent counsel, particularly with regard
to the secrecy of the grand jury, I have insisted on a high
commitment to professional conduct. I have expressed this
commitment to you repeatedly. From the beginning, I have made the
prohibition of leaks a principal priority of the Office. It is a
firing offense, as well as one that leads to criminal prosecution.
In the case of each allegation of improper disclosure, we have
thoroughly investigated the facts and reminded the staff that leaks
are utterly intolerable.
In light of the unclear press attributions in some examples
cited in your letter, I have undertaken an investigation to
determine whether, despite my persistent admonitions, someone in
this office may be culpable. I have no factual basis _ as you
likewise do not have _ even to suspect anyone at this juncture. I
am undertaking this investigation with deep regret, because I know
how demoralizing it is to a staff of highly professional and
experienced Federal prosecutors. You do an extreme disservice to
these men and women _ and to the legal profession and the public _
by your unsupported charges.
Indeed, the ''facts'' from the press that you cite as evidence
of misconduct were, in each case, known to individuals outside my
office. These individuals include witnesses, my lawyers, and
others. Let me cite one noteworthy example: Monica Lewinsky's
attorney, William Ginsburg, has told the world that he was in touch
with lawyers on both sides of the pending civil case.
The ''leaks'' that you complain about, thus, may have come from
sources close to those under investigation. Those sources would
have a clear and manifest motivation to release harmful information
with carefully crafted defenses in order to lessen the painful
impact of such evidence when it is revealed through official
proceedings.
Finally, your role as private defense counsel and your loyalty
to your client does not qualify you to lecture me on professional
conduct and my legal responsibilities. I believe you know where I
stand and have always stood on these issues. Fiercely aggressive
representation, including through media grandstanding, cannot be an
excuse for smearing a lawyer through reckless accusations. Let's
stick to facts. Let's find out the truth.
