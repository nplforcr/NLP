Conservatives including Sen. John D. Ashcroft (R-Mo.) yesterday launched a drive 
to block Senate confirmation of David Satcher as surgeon general, setting the 
stage for a potentially rancorous fight over his nomination after Congress 
reconvenes next Tuesday. 

At a news conference sponsored by the conservative journal Human Events, 
Ashcroft and representatives of the Christian Coalition and the Family Research 
Council objected in particular to Satcher's support for President Clinton's 
stand opposing passage of legislation to ban what critics describe as 
"partial-birth" abortions. 

"The nation's chief medical officer should be above reproach," Ashcroft said. 
"Unfortunately, this is not the case with this nominee. Dr. Satcher joins with 
the president in support of 'partial birth' abortion, a position that places him 
squarely at odds with the professional and ethical judgment of the American 
Medical Association." 

But in separate statements yesterday, the AMA and American Academy of Family 
Physicians reaffirmed their support for Satcher and called for his prompt 
confirmation. 

"The American Medical Association continues to enthusiastically support Dr. 
David Satcher. . . . He will bring a wealth of experience from both the private 
and public sectors to the office," said AMA President-elect Nancy W. Dickey. The 
surgeon general's office "has been vacant far too long," and "the American 
public needs a credible voice they can turn to in times of a public health 
crisis," she added. 

Satcher, a former president of Meharry Medical College who has served as 
director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention since 1993, was 
nominated last year by Clinton. His nomination was approved by the Senate Labor 
and Human Resources Committee and he appeared to have broad support in the 
Senate. But final Senate action was held up, largely because of conservatives' 
abortion-related objections. 

While Ashcroft indicated he will keep trying to hold up action on the 
nomination, the timing is up to Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.), who 
said in a CNN interview Sunday that he intends to seek a vote "in the first 
couple of weeks" after Congress reconvenes. He would have to consider any "new 
information available from Sen. Ashcroft or others," Lott said. "But I think at 
some point the responsible thing to do is to call it on up. Let's have a debate 
on his qualifications and his positions and have a vote," Lott added. 

Lott appeared to be a major focus of the conservatives' effort to derail 
Satcher's nomination. Randy Tate, executive director of the Christian Coalition, 
noted that Lott said Congress is the proper arena for action on abortion in a 
letter to the Republican National Committee before it voted last weekend against 
penalizing GOP candidates who oppose the ban. So Lott should "exercise 
leadership in the U.S. Senate and defend these innocent children by defeating 
this nomination," Tate said. 

Meanwhile, on another contentious nomination, the Justice Department disagreed 
with two influential senators who contend that Bill Lann Lee, whose nomination 
as assistant attorney general for civil rights was stalled in the Senate last 
year, cannot serve in an acting capacity in the job beyond 120 days. 

In letters to Senate Judiciary Committee Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) and Sen. Robert 
C. Byrd (D-W.Va.), Assistant Attorney General Andrew Fois said it has "long been 
the position" of the Justice Department that it does not fall under the 120-day 
limitation prescribed by the Vacancies Act. In any case, the limitation would no 
longer apply when Clinton renominates Lee, as he has said he will do, Fois said. 


There was no immediate response from Hatch or Byrd.
