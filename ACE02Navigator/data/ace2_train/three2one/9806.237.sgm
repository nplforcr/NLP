Ten days before President Clinton's departure for China, thousands of protesters 
gathered on the Capitol lawn yesterday afternoon on the National Day of Action 
for a Free Tibet. 

It was a sunny afternoon of chants, prayers and celebrity-gawking. Speeches from 
exiled Tibetan leaders, activists and members of Congress were interspersed with 
musical acts. 

Speakers representing a wide political spectrum called upon the president to 
keep human rights in Tibet a priority as he meets with Chinese government 
officials later this month and to pressure the Chinese to open negotiations with 
the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan leader. 

"If Israel can meet with Palestine and Britain can meet with [Irish nationalist] 
Gerry Adams, why can't China meet with the Dalai Lama?" asked John Ackerly, 
president of the International Campaign to Free Tibet. Clinton's nine-day, 
five-city tour is the first U.S. presidential visit to China since the 1989 
Tiananmen Square massacre. 

The young crowd at yesterday's rally mirrored the 120,000 concertgoers who had 
attended the weekend's two-day Tibetan Freedom Concert, a benefit held by the 
Milarepa Fund to raise awareness about Tibet. One large pink banner unfurled on 
the marble steps of the Capitol read "Party for your right to fight." Protesters 
were adorned with brightly colored Tibetan flags, nose rings and extensive 
tattoos. Performances by members of R.E.M., Thom Yorke of Radiohead, David 
Crosby with Sean Lennon, and Perry Farrell of Jane's Addiction fueled the crowd. 
"I haven't see a movement of college-age kids and older [people] since my days 
in college. Then it was about the Vietnam War," said actor Richard Gere, a 
longtime activist on Tibet. 

Speakers delineated a variety of human rights abuses occurring in Tibet under 
the Chinese government, including the torture of political prisoners, forced 
sterilization and abortions and religious and cultural oppression. One major 
concern of activists is the whereabouts of the Panchan Lama, a 9-year-old 
considered to be the youngest political prisoner in the world. The Panchan Lama 
disappeared in May 1995 with his parents. 

P.J. Crowley, a White House spokesperson, said that the administration "strongly 
supports the protection of Tibet's unique cultural, religious and linguistic 
heritage. We believe that resumption of a dialogue between Beijing and the Dalai 
Lama's representative is an essential step to achieve this goal and to assure 
greater protection of human rights in Tibet." 

The Chinese Foreign Ministry issued a statement on Tibet that said in part: "We 
are firmly opposed to activities, in whatever name or under whatever pretext 
which support the Dalai Lama's political maneuvers to split Tibet from China." 

The rally drew protesters from across the continent. Za Choeje Rinpoche, a 
Tibetan monk, came with members of his Atlanta monastery. Kirsten Johnson, 27, 
of Victoria, British Columbia, organized a cross-country bus trip for 40 people 
from Seattle to Washington. At rest stops, they held Tibetan information 
sessions and asked people to sign banners in support of a free Tibet. 

"Some people didn't know what Tibet was, especially in the Midwest," Johnson 
said. 

In addition to the longtime Tibetan activists, the rally also attracted the 
newly informed and curious. Kristina Siegloch, 18, of the District, learned 
about the rally through the speeches and handouts at the concert. Her class at 
the German School in Potomac decided to hold the traditional "Senior Skip Day" 
yesterday to coincide with the demonstration. "It made more sense to go to the 
rally instead of meeting at Starbucks," Siegloch said. "It's important that 
Clinton go to China knowing that Tibet is an issue that is important to America 
and to American youth."
