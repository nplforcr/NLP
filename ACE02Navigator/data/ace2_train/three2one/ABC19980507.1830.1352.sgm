 The summer movie scene is almost upon us again. Tomorrow, something
 called Deep Impact is scheduled to open. And later in the summer, we're
 going to get Armageddon.
 They are both trying to capitalize on the notion that here on Earth
 we are in danger from monster asteroids or comets hurtling in our
 direction.
 So, given what we're going to go through with the movies, let's go to the
 science. Here's ABC's Ned Potter.

 Annihilation from above? It's all over the movie screens.

 It happened to the dinosaurs. And scientists believe such calamities are
 routine.

 Things that could send civilization back into the Dark Ages probably happen
 every several hundred thousand years.

<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1395.827" endTime="1405.635">
 There's now evidence to prove that. A new report says two hundred fourteen million years ago, eighty percent of life on Earth may have been wiped out by asteroids.

 We now suggesting that there may have been five such ah events ah that may
 have been ah occurred within as brief a period of time as four hours.

 David Rowley's team studied impact craters that seem unrelated on a modern
 map. But when you turn back the clock two hundred million years to where the
 continents were before they drifted to their current positions, the craters
 are almost in a straight line.

 Indicating that the body that collided with Earth came in in chunks. And you
 know, bang, bang, bang.

<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1437.232" endTime="1443.975">
 That's precisely the kind of bang, bang, bang that happened only four years
 ago, as fragments of a comet went crashing into Jupiter.

<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1443.975" endTime="1454.374">
 People could see the damage with a small backyard telescopes. ah The firestorm
 that resulted was ah in in each case was as large as the planet Earth.

<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1454.374" endTime="1476.895">
 As large as Earth or as small as sand, at cosmic speeds, even the tiniest
 debris in the solar system can spell trouble.
 Each November, the Earth passes through the orbit of an old comet. Once
 every thirty-three years, the dust from that comet is unusually thick. The problem
 is that we've never had one of these cosmic dust storms when there were five hundred
 working satellites in orbit. Some of them could actually be knocked out.

<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1476.895" endTime="1481.391">
 Every satellite is going to get hit. The question is how often and by what
 size particles?
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1482.190" endTime="1488.534">
 It is still safe to go outside. A mile wide asteroid hits us, on average,
 only once every three hundred thousand years.

 To scan the sky for danger, NASA's doubling
 its budget to three million dollars. But of course, the comet movie that opens
 tomorrow cost seventy-five million. Ned Potter, ABC News, New York.

 We had planned on one more installment of our gambling series against the odds tonight when gambling comes to your town because of all the car news today we are going to hold it. We won't lose it.
