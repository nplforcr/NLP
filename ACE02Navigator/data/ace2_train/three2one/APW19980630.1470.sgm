TOKYO (AP) _ So there he is, ally No. 1, shaking hands with
China's leaders, hailing them for their efforts to ease Asia's
financial crisis, pledging closer ties in the future.
As President Bill Clinton swings through China, leaders in Tokyo
are watching from the sidelines and beginning to worry that their
biggest neighbor may be stealing their best friend.
And, in the middle of its worst recession since World War II,
Japan needs that friend.
China has always weighed heavily on the Japanese mind, but
Clinton's decision not to visit Japan on his way back has generated
a good deal of fretting here.
Japanese newspaper editorials have written ominously of ``the
new U.S.-China era'' and ``America and China's new partnership for
the 21st Century.''
To make matters worse, Clinton on Tuesday pointedly praised
China's leaders for their role in keeping Asia's financial crisis
from getting out of hand, calling China a ``force of stability.''
He then prodded Japan to do more to boost its laggard economy.
For Japan, there is more at stake than pride.
Experts have long predicted that it could be just a matter of
time before China's steady march toward free-market liberalization
and increased democracy will make the world's most populous nation
the dominant economic power in Asia.
To many here, Clinton's overtures toward China are more proof
that the United States and other countries are increasingly eager
to throw in their lot with Asia's awakening giant.
``The Japanese should be worried,'' said Gregory Clark, a
professor of politics at Tokyo's Tama University. ``We could be
back in the 1930s where America had to choose between Japan and
China _ and chose China.''
Clark acknowledged that while the United States' foreign policy
in Asia has for decades focused on its ties with Japan, it has been
careful to keep its options open.
But now, he said, Washington is ``beginning to play the other
option.''
Playing the other option could mean stepping up efforts to turn
China into a major trading partner, a move that would boost China's
economy and help it challenge Japan's pre-eminent position in the
region.
Closer U.S.-China ties could also lead China to rely more on the
United States for its infrastructure needs, squeezing out Japanese
companies that have long done business there.
Still, not all experts agree Clinton's visit to China
necessarily heralds a significant shift in the Asian balance of
power.
Many analysts say that while Japan's international standing is
low now, it will revive as soon as the economy picks up.
That economy, they note, still dwarfs that of China, and the
U.S.-Japan military alliance remains crucial to regional stability.
Nearly 50,000 U.S. troops are stationed in Japan.
``Japan is still America's closest ally in terms of security,''
said Shigenori Okazaki, a political analyst at SBC Warburg. ``In
terms of the security arrangement, China is no comparison.''
Much of the problem Japan is having with Clinton's visit is its
timing.
The visit comes as Japan is struggling to come out from under a
tidal wave of international criticism _ much of it from the United
States _ over its fumbled attempts to get out of recession.
But Japan also still holds bad memories of the ``Nixon shock,''
when, without prior consultations with Tokyo, President Richard
Nixon made his historic trek to Beijing in 1972.
The United States has scrambled to allay fears that Clinton's
overtures to China mean Washington is downgrading its relationship
with Japan.
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will visit Tokyo this
week to smooth any ruffled feathers, and on Tuesday, America's
ambassador to Japan, Thomas Foley, went out of his way to be
reassuring.
``I am a bit puzzled that warmer U.S.-China ties (are seen by
some to) somehow undermine the U.S.-Japan relationship,'' Foley
said at a luncheon Tuesday.
