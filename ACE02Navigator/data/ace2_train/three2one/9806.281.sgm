ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast, June 12-
 


Hundreds of Nigerians held scattered protests today in Lagos to demand an end to 
military rule, but troops and police dispersed them with tear gas and warning 
shots, witnesses and news reports said. 

The Lagos-based leadership of Nigeria's democracy movement had called for 
demonstrations today to press Nigeria's new leader, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, to 
quickly end Nigeria's 15 straight years of military rule by handing power to a 
transitional government under jailed politician Moshood Abiola. 

The protest marked the fifth anniversary of Abiola's apparent victory in a 
presidential election that was subsequently scuttled by the military. 

But relatively few Nigerians responded to the call, underscoring that, while the 
military government is deeply unpopular, few Nigerians are ready to actively 
confront it. Democracy activists said protests were held today outside Lagos, 
but there was no independent report of them. 

Many Nigerians are consumed by their daily struggle for survival amid the 
country's economic collapse. And some activists and Nigerian journalists have 
said many people want to give Abubakar more time to respond to the popular 
demand for civilian rule. 

Abubakar was named head of state Monday night after his predecessor, Gen. Sani 
Abacha, died, reportedly of a heart attack. Abacha had promised a handover to 
civilian rule but maneuvered himself into position as the only legal candidate 
in presidential elections scheduled for Aug. 1. 

Nigerians have overwhelmingly rejected the Abacha transition plan, but Abubakar, 
upon taking power, declared he would complete it. The democracy movement 
contends that the Abacha process can only be a front for continued military 
rule. 

The government had banned today's protests, and police and troops heavily 
deployed forces around Lagos to prevent them. At a square in the Yaba district, 
an estimated 200 people, mostly young men, gathered. Many carried 
anti-government placards and leaflets, according to news agencies and Nigerian 
journalists. 

As pro-democracy leaders headed by human rights lawyer Gani Fawehinmi arrived to 
begin a rally, police swept into the square, firing tear gas canisters and 
warning shots into the air. No deaths or injuries were immediately reported. 

People fled, and Fawehinmi collapsed from the tear gas and was taken away by 
police. His spokesman in the United States, Lanre Banjo, said tonight that 
police had charged Fawehinmi with inciting the public against the government and 
had released him after a few hours. 

In all, Banjo said, the protest's organizing group, the Joint Action Committee 
of Nigeria, was aware of about 40 people who had been arrested. 

Police also took to the streets in Ibadan, but the city, Nigeria's 
second-largest, remained calm, the BBC reported. Anti-government riots in Ibadan 
left seven dead last month. 

Lagos and Ibadan are the main cities of Nigeria's ethnic Yorubas, who are the 
country's most alienated group. Yorubas say they are denied a fair share of 
political power by northern ethnic groups -- including Hausas and Fulanis -- 
that have dominated the military and the government since Nigeria's independence 
from Britain in 1960. 

Today's protest underscored that Nigeria has suffered more or less continual 
crisis and confrontation for five years. 

In 1993, the northern-dominated government of Gen. Ibrahim Babangida, having 
promised a return to civilian rule, held elections on June 12 for a civilian 
president. But when the vote count showed Abiola, a southern Yoruba, crushing 
his northern, Hausa-speaking opponent, Bashir Tofa, the government canceled the 
vote, throwing the country into an uproar. 

Babangida soon surrendered power to a military-backed civilian interim 
government, which Abacha pushed aside after three months. A year later, he 
jailed Abiola for insisting on his claim to power, and protests have continued 
sporadically since then.
