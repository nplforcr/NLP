A U.S. judge in Texas Wednesday temporarily stayed his year-end
decision that invalidated major portions of the Telecommunications
Act of 1996.
Wednesday's action keeps the telecommunications industry in the
regulatory status it had before Dec. 31, when Judge Joe Kendall of
the U.S. District Court in Wichita Falls, Texas, ruled that local
Bell telephone companies should be allowed to sell long-distance
service without passing a rigorous review by the Federal
Communications Commission.
That process was the cornerstone of the act, and in ruling the
portions forcing the review unconstitutional, the judge threw into
question the entire structure of telecommunications regulation in
the United States.
Now, the Bells, which had hoped to offer long distance early
this year, must abide by the language of the act until the judge's
original decision is considered by courts of appeal _ a process
that could take months or years.
The act says that the Bells, because of their history as part of
AT&AMP;T Corp., must win special approvals from the FCC before they may
sell long-distance service. No Bell has won such approval.
Other large local phone companies, however, like GTE Corp., are
allowed to enter the $80 billion long-distance market without
passing such a rigorous review.
In December, Kendall ruled that the act violated the
Constitution by essentially convicting the Bells _ Ameritech, Bell
Atlantic, BellSouth, SBC Communications and US West _ of antitrust
violations without a trial.
But Wednesday the judge stayed the decision, pending appeal. The
FCC, along with AT&AMP;T and MCI Communications Corp., has petitioned
the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, based in New Orleans, to
hear the case.
Lawyers involved in the case said Wednesday that they did not
expect the appeals court to hear arguments in the dispute for at
least a few months.
The lawyers also said that it was unusual that Kendall did not
explain his reason for granting the stay. The big long-distance
companies had argued that they would suffer irreparably were the
decision allowed to go into effect.
``The Bell monopolies must still comply with the requirements of
the telecom act before they can enter the highly competitive
long-distance market,'' MCI said in a statement.
``Obviously we're pleased that he granted the stay,'' added
Peter Lucht, an MCI spokesman.
SBC Communications, the Bell that originally filed the lawsuit,
played down Wednesday's action. ``The order granting the stay is
not unusual,'' the company said in a statement. `The appeals
process will be resolved quickly, and we are confident that the
ruling will be upheld.''
Kendall declined to issue an injunction specifically barring the
Bells from selling long-distance service. But the stay essentially
keeps the Bells out of the long-distance market for the time being.
Even as he granted the stay, Kendall stood by his original
decision, which he said was important to maintain the separation of
powers among the branches of the federal government.
``Despite all the noise, spin and reams of papers, legally this
case isn't so much about Milt Friedman vs. Kenneth Galbraith as it
is about James Madison,'' he wrote.
Friedman is a free-market economist, while John Kenneth
Galbraith is an economist who generally sees a more positive role
for government intervention in the economy.
