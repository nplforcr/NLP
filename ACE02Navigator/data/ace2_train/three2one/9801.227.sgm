JERUSALEM, Jan. 18-
 


Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu is to arrive in Washington to discuss 
Middle East peace this week after having whittled down expectations so 
insistently that even any sign of progress may be greeted as a ray of hope. 

His conservative cabinet members spent much of the week preced ing the premier's 
departure, set for Monday, elaborating what they would not do to make peace with 
the Palestinians, where they would not do it and according to what timetable 
they would see it not get done. 

For Netanyahu, who has long regarded the 1993 Israeli-Palestinian peace accords 
with distaste -- even though he has pledged to carry them out -- it is nothing 
new that his political opponents accuse him of dragging his feet on peace or 
subverting it. 

What has changed in recent weeks is his government's standing, and his own hold 
on power. Neither seems to bode well for the peace prospects, many analysts here 
say. 

The resignation two weeks ago of Foreign Minister David Levy who, within the 
rightist cabinet was considered a moderate, set the tone for the cabinet moves 
that followed. The departure of Levy, who controls five seats in the Israeli 
parliament, left the government with a 61-59 parliamentary majority and 
significantly more susceptible to hard-line pressure, particularly on the 
land-for-peace formula at the heart of the Middle East peace process. 

Many conservatives in the Jewish state long have been uneasy with the 
land-for-peace trade-off, by which Israel would return Arab territory it 
captured in 1967 in exchange for guarantees of peace from the Arabs, seeing it 
as tantamount to forfeiting security. They say Israel should not withdraw any 
more troops from the West Bank until the Palestinians make significant progress 
on a range of security issues, including a crackdown on suspected terrorists 
operating from the territory. 

"It's become land for war, land for bloodshed, land for terror," David 
Bar-Illan, a top adviser to Netanyahu, said in an interview. 

Guided by that outlook, Netanyahu's cabinet staked out its position in a series 
of actions before his meeting Tuesday with President Clinton. 

First, the prime minister declared that even if the government decided to go 
ahead with any pullback of Israeli troops, it would have to wait -- possibly for 
months -- until the Palestinians complied with previous commitments on security 
and other matters that Israel contends have not yet been met. 

Next, the cabinet published an extensive list of accusations of Palestinian 
noncompliance, further emphasizing that no withdrawal would occur until the 
points were addressed. Finally, the cabinet declared large chunks of the West 
Bank as areas of Israel's "vital interests," suggesting they are nonnegotiable 
in any discussions of an eventual Palestinian state. Today, the cabinet delayed 
a decision on the land plan. 

Moreover, Israeli officials have said Netanyahu will not present Clinton with a 
map of the West Bank indicating from what areas Israeli troops might be 
withdrawn next. The White House has wanted such a proposal. 

The Clinton administration and left-wing critics of Netanyahu in Israel see the 
Israelis' moves primarily as bargaining positions but unhelpful nonetheless. 

Netanyahu "has a policy on the peace process -- to keep putting it off and 
putting it off," said Galia Golan, an activist for the advocacy group Peace Now. 
"He was and is opposed to [the 1993 accords] and believes in the idea of a 
Greater Israel." 

But that did not mitigate the political reality in Israel that has Netanyahu in 
such a bind -- that any Israeli pullback from significant chunks of West Bank 
land could cause hard-liners to bolt from the cabinet, triggering the 
government's collapse. 

"There is now a paradigm of a weak prime minister who claims not to have enough 
power to move in a serious direction and can only move incrementally," said 
Yaron Ezrahi, an Israeli political scientist. 

"And this means the Palestinians and Americans must choose between accepting [a 
small concession] and getting as much as one can get at this stage, even if it's 
contrary to some expectations and a sense of fairness, or trying to force a 
conflict that will either strengthen Netanyahu by making him appear as a hero to 
the Israeli right or destabilize his government with all the uncertainties that 
new elections and a campaign carry. It's a very difficult choice." 

Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, scheduled to meet with Clinton two days after 
Netanyahu, has reacted in generally subdued tones while not hiding his 
frustration with the Israeli government's decisions. At the same time, he has 
characterized the Washington meetings as a last gasp for the peace process, 
warning that failure could provoke a renewed popular uprising by the 
Palestinians against Israeli military occupation. 

That warning has been repeated incessantly in the Israeli media, broadcast along 
with reports that the Palestinians and Israeli forces are covertly preparing for 
new hostilities. The reports are dismaying to Jews and Palestinians here, who 
have been shown by clear majorities in public opinion polls to favor progress in 
the peace process. 

"It's easy to say the Arabs are to blame but they'll just say we're to blame," 
said Mikhail Bykov, an Israeli in the West Bank settlement of Qiryat Arba, south 
of Jerusalem. "There's no alternative to the peace process. If the other side's 
making steps toward peace, there's no reason we can't do the same." 

Mindful of that strand of Israeli public opinion, and its corollary in the 
United States, Netanyahu has taken pains to launch a full-scale public relations 
offensive, insisting that he wants progress on peace -- but not at any cost. 

In his effort to remind people of a need to press the Palestinians on the issue 
of terror, Netanyahu is including as part of his official delegation in 
Washington two relatives of Israelis killed in terror attacks. 

One is the widow of a man stabbed three years ago by a Palestinian who is now a 
police officer in Gaza, according to Bar-Illan, Netanyahu's adviser. The other 
is the mother of a man killed near Jerusalem in 1996 by Palestinians now living 
in Jericho, in the West Bank, he said. In both cases, Arafat's Palestinian 
Authority has done nothing to bring the killers to justice, according to 
Bar-Illan. 

Arafat, meanwhile, will press his own public relations offensive, meeting with 
French President Jacques Chirac, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and other 
dignitaries on stops before he reaches Washington.
