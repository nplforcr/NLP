MOSCOW, Feb. 5-
 


President Boris Yeltsin strongly warned the United States again today against 
using force in Iraq, saying Russia "would not allow" a military strike and 
reiterating that it could lead to "world war." 

The Foreign Ministry added that Russia would not "resort to extreme measures" in 
response to President Clinton's order to increase troop levels in the Persian 
Gulf. 

"We should not allow an armed strike, an American strike, whatever the 
circumstances," Yeltsin told journalists on the eve of a planned visit to Italy 
and the Vatican. "I told Bill Clinton that we would not allow that." He added, 
"The most important thing is that we assumed a firm stand: no to the settlement 
through the use of force. It is impossible; it will mean a world war." 

For months, Russia has tried to broker a diplomatic resolution of the tension 
over Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's refusal to allow international inspections 
of locations where Iraq is believed to harbor weapons of mass destruction. 

But Russia has taken a higher profile in recent days with Yeltsin's blunt, 
public warnings against a military strike, which contrasted with earlier 
diplomatic initiatives that skirted any collision with the United States. 
Yeltsin used the "world war" formulation Wednesday as well, and aides scrambled 
afterward to say that it was not a threat of military retaliation. 

Yeltsin's warnings dovetail with criticism of U.S. actions by Russia's 
nationalists and Communists in parliament. Unlike the confrontation with Iraq in 
1990-91, there are few voices here today arguing for cooperation with the United 
States. 

The Iraqi news agency INA reported today from Baghdad that the National Assembly 
had invited a group from Russia's lower house of parliament, the State Duma, to 
visit some of the disputed sites -- the presidential palaces from which U.N. 
inspectors have been barred. 

Yeltsin said today he saw the crisis easing slightly. "I am an optimist," he 
added. "We still cannot say with confidence that everything is all right, that 
another heightening of tension is out of the question. Nevertheless, the recent 
peak of tension was brought down a little. Tension is on the way down." 

Yeltsin claimed Russia's position had attracted support from France and Italy. 
"Britain is still somewhat hesitant," he said, but he added that Prime Minister 
Tony Blair had promised in a telephone call Wednesday not to send more military 
equipment to the Persian Gulf. 

At the same time, Russia's Foreign Ministry issued a statement saying the threat 
of U.S. military action still exists. Russia believes that "using force in Iraq 
or threatening to do so is extremely dangerous under any circumstances," the 
ministry said. 

Deputy Foreign Minister Viktor Posuvalyuk remains in Baghdad, where he has been 
negotiating with Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister, Tariq Aziz. Earlier this week, 
Russian officials had called his mission a success, saying he had worked out a 
compromise allowing for the conditional inspection of eight sites. Iraq denied 
there was any deal. 

Today, the Interfax news agency quoted a Russian official as saying the process 
of resolving the crisis was "at the start of the road" and that it was premature 
to conclude that Iraq's position had changed.
