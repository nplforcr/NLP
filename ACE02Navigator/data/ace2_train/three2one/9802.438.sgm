National Public Radio President Delano Lewis last week violated the adage that 
there are some things even your best friends won't tell you. 

Lewis told his longtime friend Robert Johnson, founder of Washington's Black 
Entertainment Television Network, that Johnson's offer to buy out the public 
stockholders of BET Holdings Inc. for $ 48 a share isn't good enough. 

The pronouncement surprised investors who had complained that as a hand-picked 
member of BET's board, Lewis was likely to rubber stamp the $ 288 million buyout 
bid made by Johnson and his partners at Liberty Media Group, a subsidiary of the 
cable television giant Tele-Communications Inc.. 

But it was a pleasant surprise for the investors who have complained in a 
shareholders' lawsuit that Johnson's $ 48 offer in November was a low-ball bid 
for stock that could be worth twice that much. 

Because of Lewis's rejection, the betting is that stockholders will get a better 
offer, probably soon. 

Lewis was put on the spot last fall when Johnson appointed him a committee of 
one to evaluate the offer on behalf of BET's board of directors. 

Like board members of most companies created by entrepreneurs, BET's directors 
are not people prone to playing hardball with the chief executive. Since Johnson 
controls two-thirds of the votes of BET's three classes of stock, he picks most 
of the directors. 

For example, BET's board includes Johnson's wife, Sheila; actor Denzel 
Washington; TCI President John Malone; and Liberty President Robert Bennett, as 
well as others with ties to the founder. 

Lewis, a former president of Chesapeake & Potomac Telephone Cos., is the closest 
thing the BET board has to an independent, professional outside director. He 
also is on the boards of Colgate-Palmolive Co., Guest Services Inc. and 
Halliburton Co. 

Asking for an "independent evaluation" or a "fairness opinion" is standard 
procedure when insiders of a company make an offer to buy out the public 
shareholders. Cynicism is the standard reaction to those "independent 
evaluations." Investment bankers in the past have given their stamp of approval 
to many buyouts that were later declared by judges to be unfair to the 
stockholders. 

Whether the decision to reject the BET offer reinforced that cynicism or proved 
that board members really can be independent depends on how you look at it. 

One view is that not even Bob Johnson's best friend could have held his nose and 
proclaimed that $ 48 is a fair price for BET stock. Giving Lewis full credit for 
his professionalism and independence, it didn't take an investment banker to 
suspect the price was too low, even though it was $ 10 a share more than the 
stock was selling for at the time. 

Investors certainly thought so. As soon as the offer was made in September, the 
stock jumped to more than $ 50 from about $ 40 a share, then moved up a few 
dollars a share. Rejection of the Johnson buyout offer pushed the shares to an 
all-time high of $ 55.12 1/2 on Friday. 

Another view is that Lewis was guaranteed to get sued if he went along with the 
$ 48-a-share offer. A favorable fairness opinion simply would have added Lewis 
and the investment bankers at Goldman Sachs & Co. to the list of defendants in 
the shareholders lawsuit, which was filed by a New York attorney who specializes 
in such cases. 

Goldman Sachs was hired by Lewis to crunch the numbers and calculate whether 
Johnson and TCI were offering a fair price. Their conclusion was a terse 
pronouncement that $ 48 "is not adequate." 

Lewis was out of town last week and referred inquiries to Arthur Bill of 
Washington's Freedman, Levy, Kroll and Simonds, who is counsel to the Lewis 
committee. 

The decision doesn't mean the buyout is off, Bill said. "Discussions are ongoing 
between the special committee and the buyers' group," he said. He wouldn't say 
whether Goldman Sachs had placed a value on the stock. 

"All I can say is that Goldman and Salomon Brothers [the investment bankers for 
Johnson and TCI] are going to be engaging in discussions of whether the 
principals can reach an understanding." 

BET's official position is "no comment," said Media Relations Director Michele 
Moore. 

It's typical for players in these games to hold their cards close to the vest. 

One investor who is betting on Johnson to raise his bid is Mario Gabelli, the 
New York money manager who is the biggest outside shareholder in BET. A report 
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission last Thursday reveals Gabelli 
has been methodically buying up BET stock recently. As of Jan. 23 he controlled 
1.74 million shares, or 17.3 percent of BET's Class A stock -- the only kind 
owned by the public. 

"The ball's now in Bob Johnson and Bob Bennett's court," Gabelli said last week. 
"It's up to them to up it or walk away." 

Gabelli's SEC reports show companies he controls own BET stock for clients, and 
they've continued to buy as the stock price has soared well beyond the $ 48 
offer on the table. 

Clearly, he thinks any new offer would have to be higher than that. "Forty-eight 
was too low. Everybody knows that. I'd pay $ 55," added Gabelli, who said his 
calculations value BET at between $ 58 and $ 72 a share. 

Gabelli says that besides a better offer from BET insiders, there are a couple 
of other possibilities. 

One would be that Goldman and Salomon Bros. can't agree on a price, so Johnson 
puts the offer on hold. "In which case," Gabelli said, "my clients are not 
unhappy" because they like owning the stock. 

Or "they come in with a price that is below what I call fair, then I can either 
accept it or go for appraisal rights." Legally, minority shareholders who object 
to a buyout can demand an independent appraisal of the stock, which both sides 
must then accept. 

Gabelli says he's not trying to hold the proverbial gun to Johnson's head. 
Quoting one of the aphorisms that has made him a favorite of financial 
television shows, "Bulls make money. Bears make money. Pigs get slaughtered." 

While Gabelli insists the stock is worth more than Johnson offered, he is not a 
party to the shareholder suit. 

"The shareholder lawsuit is a scam," he said. "These lawyers are ambulance 
chasers. It's like a Madonna concert, they're rushing to get on queue first" so 
they can collect legal fees by persuading the defendants to settle the case 
quickly. 

Some shareholder lawsuits challenging takeovers have merit, he added, "but some 
are filed by pilgrims. You know what pilgrims are? Early settlers." 

Since Johnson made his offer to buy out public shareholders, Gabelli has bought 
an additional 200,000 shares of stock, according to his latest SEC filings. The 
stock, held by half a dozen entities he controls, is worth about $ 83.5 million 
at the $ 48-a-share price on the table. Kick the offer up to, say, $ 55 a share, 
and he'd get more than $ 95 million. 

That price would raise the total cost of the buyback from $ 288 million to $ 330 
million, which Johnson and his partners ought to be able to afford. BET has only 
$ 62 million in debt and generated $ 33 million in cash flow last year, more 
than enough to cover the interest on $ 330 million at today's rates. 

Johnson owns 20.9 percent of the stock, TCI holds 18.2 percent and 6.6 percent 
is under control of Capital Group Cos., a Los Angeles investment firm. 

Besides the common stock, which was sold to the public for $ 17 a share in 1991, 
BET has two other classes of stock that are owned exclusively by insiders. The 
Class B stock is entirely owned by TCI and the Class C stock is all Johnson's. 

Those two stocks have 10 voters per share, compared with one vote a share of the 
common. As a practical matter, the public shareholders have no real voice in how 
BET is run and not much leverage in buyout negotiations. 

That powerless position is all too familiar for Washington investors. Dozens of 
corporations in the region are dominated by the entrepreneurs who started the 
company and then sold a minority interest to the public. Horror stories abound, 
lead by the laments of shareholders held hostage by the Haft family's previous 
domination of Dart Group Inc., the Landover-based holding company for Crown 
Books and Trak Auto. 

Given all the abuses that shareholders in those and other companies have 
suffered at the hands of insiders, BET's stockholders now appear to have a good 
shot at getting a fair shake from Bob Johnson and John Malone. 

They'll need to thank Del Lewis for that. How grateful they'll be depends on 
Johnson's next offer.
