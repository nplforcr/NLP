Snyder Communications Inc. of Bethesda announced yesterday that it has acquired 
Arnold Communications Inc., one of New England's biggest advertising agencies, 
significantly expanding the marketing services it can offer to clients. 

The purchase price was not disclosed, but analysts estimated it was about $ 120 
million in stock. They said Snyder gains a nationally known creative powerhouse 
by buying Boston-based Arnold. Snyder creates targeted marketing campaigns for 
telecommunications, packaged goods and pharmaceutical companies. 

Privately held Arnold, which had about $ 750 million in billings and $ 90.7 
million in revenue last year, handles advertising for such major corporations as 
McDonald's Corp., Volkswagen of America Inc. and Bell Atlantic Corp. Its local 
office in McLean is one of the biggest ad agencies in the Washington area, with 
such clients as the National Geographic Society, the American Red Cross and SAP 
AG, the German software maker. 

Adweek, a trade publication, recently selected Arnold as the New England Agency 
of the Year for the third straight year. 

An increasing number of Fortune 500 companies are turning to a single agency to 
handle all of their marketing and communications needs. Previously, corporations 
would spread their work around -- for example, one firm would handle public 
relations and another would do advertising -- but nowadays they look for a 
single "fully integrated" agency. 

For this reason, analysts said, the Arnold acquisition is a smart move for 
Snyder,. With 900 employees, Arnold operates in several business areas that 
Snyder does not, including advertising, public relations and interactive media 
services. 

Arnold's direct marketing and database management services will complement 
current offerings by Snyder, analysts said. 

"This brings some new clients to Synder and presents some opportunities for 
cross-selling," said Fran Blechman Bernstein, an analyst at Merrill Lynch Global 
Securities. 

Daniel M. Snyder, Snyder's 33-year-old chairman and chief executive, who founded 
the company with his sister in 1987, said the purchase will particularly help 
the firm expand its direct-to-consumer pharmaceutical marketing business. In the 
past few years, drug companies have started targeting their products to specific 
patient groups, in addition to selling to health-care officials. 

Snyder has marketed to patients since its founding. For example, the company 
produces "WallBoards," posters with graphics, information and advertising in 
doctors' offices and other medical facilities. With the acquisition of Arnold, 
Snyder can make television commercials for its pharmaceutical clients, which 
include 16 of the top 20 drug companies. 

"Arnold is a perfect, perfect fit for our health-care areas," Daniel Snyder 
said. 

Snyder said Arnold will still be based in Boston and operate as an independent 
division of his company, with current management remaining in place. He does not 
expect layoffs. 

With more than 6,800 employees, Snyder had $ 333.4 million in revenue last year 
and a net loss of $ 8.2 million. Excluding charges related to various 
acquisitions, the company had net income of $ 26.9 million. Analysts project its 
1998 sales will exceed $ 600 million. 

Also yesterday, the Bethesda company said it acquired Publimed Promotions SA, a 
Paris-based contract drug sales and marketing company, for $ 43 million in 
stock. The purchase adds 925 people to Snyder's pharmaceutical sales force, 
giving the company nearly 4,000 sales representatives. 

News of the two purchases sent Snyder's stock up $ 2.75 to close at $ 46 5/8 
yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange. 

The Arnold and Publimed acquisitions cap a string of such deals for Snyder, 
which spent more than $ 400 million to buy 12 companies in 1997. It has bought 
four companies so far this year. 

Bernstein, the Merrill Lynch analyst, said she raised her earnings-per-share 
estimates from 84 cents to 90 cents this year and from $ 1.25 to $ 1.31 in 1999. 
Her 12-month price objective is now $ 58 a share, up from $ 50 a share.
