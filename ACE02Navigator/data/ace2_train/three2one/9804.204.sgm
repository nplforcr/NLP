Host Marriott Corp., the Bethesda-based hotel owner, will announce today
that it will pay $ 1.7 billion to buy 13 luxury hotels from Blackstone Real
Estate Advisors II L.P., spin off its nursing homes into a separately
traded public company and convert its hotel operations into a real estate
investment trust.

Host's purchase includes such highly prized properties as the Drake Hotel
in New York City, the Ritz-Carlton Amelia Island and the Hyatt Regency
Reston.

The aim of Host Marriott's reorganization is to cash in on Wall Street's
fascination with REITs, broadening the appeal of the company's shares among
investors who in the past had been cool to the stock, said sources familiar
with the deal.

As a REIT, Host Marriott will have better access to less expensive
financing and a lower tax bill, because it will pay out nearly all of its
profits to shareholders in the form of dividends. Shareholders then pay the
taxes on that income. The REIT form of corporate structure has recently
become a popular way for hotel companies to own and operate their
properties.

The Blackstone purchase will give Host 55,000 rooms, or $ 10 billion in
assets, compared with 26,000 rooms when it first became a public company in
1993. More importantly, sources said, the quality of the company's hotels
will improve, with nearly 55 percent of its properties considered luxury,
full-service hotels, compared with only 20 percent five years ago.

Officials from Marriott and Blackstone would not comment on the transaction
yesterday.

Host Marriott's moves also mark a significant turnaround for the company.
It was spun off in 1993 as a separate company from Marriott International
Inc., which now builds and manages hotels. At the time, investors and
analysts were skittish about Host because the company carried massive debt
and had divergent operations, including running food and beverage
concessions for airports and travel plazas.

Host Marriott in 1995 shed the concessions business, which now operates as
a publicly traded company, Host Marriott Services. In the past five years,
the company has reduced its ratio of debt to its total market to 47 percent
from 75 percent. The company's strategy is to improve that to 35 percent by
refinancing debt at lower interest rates through a conversion to a REIT.

The complex deal calls for Host Marriott to pay $ 835 million in cash and
debt, as well as 47 million operating partnership units in the REIT, for
the Blackstone hotels. Blackstone will own about 19 percent of Host
Marriott's outstanding shares. John Schreiber, a partner in Blackstone,
will join Host Marriott's board of directors.

Shareholders can exchange the partnership shares for one share of Host
Marriott common stock, at which time they will have to pay taxes on the
transaction. But sources familiar with the deal said that in 1999, it will
add 26 cents a share on an estimated $ 800 million in funds from
operations, a key measure of financial performance for REITs. Analysts had
estimated Host Marriott would generate earnings of $ 2.15 a share for 1999.

Host Marriott expects to complete its conversion to a REIT by January 1999.
The deal is subject to shareholder approval, even though it will have no
effect on the existing stock ownership. But as part of spinning off the
senior living communities, Host Marriott will repurchase $ 1.55 billion of
outstanding debt securities.

In the new senior living company, which has yet to be named, Host Marriott
shareholders will receive one share of stock for each share they now hold
and a cash distribution of as much as $ 1 a share. It is a taxable
transaction that Host Marriott estimates will range from $ 400 million to $
500 million. The company hopes the cash will help shareholders cover the
taxes on the transaction.

The new company will own 31 luxury retirement facilities in 12 states,
mostly those built and constructed by Marriott International.

Analysts had expected Host Marriott to join a cadre of hospitality
companies forming REITs, including CapStar Hotel Co., which announced last
month that it will merge with American General into a "paper-clipped" REIT.

The Clinton administration in January proposed eliminating the tax-free
status of mergers between "paired-shared" REITs after industry criticism
that that status helped Starwood Hotels & Lodging beat out the competition
in purchasing ITT Corp. and Westin Hotels. A paired-shared REIT operates
and manages properties in a C corporation and a REIT, which trade
separately. A paper-clipped REIT trades as one stock. The "paper clipped"
REIT and Host's conversion to an "umbrella partnership" REIT are less
controversial structures in the industry and among lawmakers than
paired-shared REITs.

Host Marriott's REIT will allow its stock to trade at a higher value,
allowing the company to use its stock to bid more for properties, several
analysts have said. The company will also be more attractive to sellers
because they can receive Host Marriott stock in exchange for the real
estate.

"It fits very cleanly" for Host Marriott to become a REIT, said Mark
Mutkoski, a lodging analyst for Bankers Trust New York. "They have proven
in the past that they can acquire properties for a good price and improve
their cash flow."
