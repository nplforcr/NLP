Maryland Federal Bancorp Inc., a Hyattsville-based thrift, announced yesterday 
that it will be acquired by BB&T Corp. of Winston-Salem, N.C., for $ 265.3 
million in stock. 

The purchase will more than double BB&T's presence in the Washington area, 
furthering a push into the region that began last year with the company's 
announcement that it would buy Franklin Bancorp Inc., a small D.C. bank. 

BB&T, with about $ 30 billion in assets the nation's 31st-largest banking 
company, joins several other major banks that have been gobbling up smaller 
locally based institutions to create or expand their presence in the Washington 
region. 

Analysts praised the deal as a smart way for BB&T to establish itself here, 
saying the combination would benefit shareholders. 

"They have an excellent track record of enhancing the profitability of the 
acquired bank by offering customers a wider array of products and services, as 
well as turning it into a more sales-oriented business," said analyst Ed 
Najarian of Wheat First Union in Richmond. 

John Allison, BB&T's chairman, said in a statement that the acquisition will 
"strengthen our position in one of the fastest-growing markets in the nation and 
establish us in a state that ranks fifth nationally in median household and 
personal income per capita." 

Officials at BB&T and Maryland Federal, however, said the new out-of-town owner 
won't mean the loss of that hometown feel. "BB&T believes in . . . providing the 
highest level of personal service possible," Robert Halleck, Maryland Federal 
president and chief executive, said in a statement. Halleck will become 
president of the new Maryland region. 

Officials said there are no plans to close any of Maryland Federal's 28 
branches. They said layoffs, if any, will be minimal. Maryland Federal, with 
about 225 employees and $ 1.2 billion in assets, is one of the few remaining 
sizable thrifts in Maryland. It has offices in 24 cities in Prince George's, 
Montgomery, Anne Arundel and Calvert counties. BB&T, with about 10,500 
employees, has 506 offices in the Carolinas and Virginia. 

Yesterday's deal values Maryland Federal at $ 37.05 a share, a 17 percent 
premium over Tuesday's $ 31.75 closing price. Based on BB&T's Tuesday closing 
price of $ 62 a share, the exchange ratio will be .5975 of a share of BB&T 
common stock for each share of Maryland Federal common stock. 

BB&T's stock dropped 5/16 to close at $ 61-11/16 on the New York Stock Exchange, 
while Maryland Federal's stock closed at $ 35.75, up $ 4, on the Nasdaq Stock 
Market. 

In December, BB&T said it would pay $ 165.1 million in stock for Franklin 
Bancorp, a Washington-based bank with $ 535 million in assets and nine branches. 
BB&T also recently agreed to buy Life Bancorp of Norfolk for $ 359.2 million in 
stock. After the acquisitions, BB&T will have about $ 5 billion in assets in 
Virginia and the D.C. area. 

The boards of both companies have approved the acquisition. But Maryland Federal 
shareholders and federal and state banking regulators also must endorse the 
deal. The companies expect the acquisition to be completed in the third quarter.
