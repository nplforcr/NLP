ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Amid efforts to crack down on its
longtime debtors, Croatia's state-run oil company Friday
confiscated 30,000 tons of oil products it had provided to a
Bosnian company, the state-run news agency HINA reported.
Officials with the Croatian oil company INA said the move was
done for economic reasons, but it is likely to erode already-tense
relations between the two neighbors.
Bosnia's state-owned oil company, Energopetrol, owes INA dlrs
3.8 million. Friday, INA confiscated 30,000 tons of oil and oil
products it had provided to Energopetrol. The Bosnian company had
not paid for the products stored in the southern Croatian port of
Ploce.
``This was done suddenly, without any negotiations, discussions
or warning,'' said Aziz Tukulj, director of domestic sales for
Energopetrol. ``My personal feeling is that this is pure
bullying.''
Energopetrol owes money to INA, Tukulj said, but wasn't sure how
much. He added that INA owes money to Energopetrol and its parent
company, Energoinvest.
He said contracts between the two companies require negotiations
be undertaken to resolve disputes.
A spokesman from INA could not be reached to confirm Tukulj's
comments.
INA recently announced that it would start punishing debtors
because unpaid bills totaling dlrs 141 million threaten its
business.
Some debtors, like Croatia's electric-power industry, airline
and railway, promised to pay up immediately.
It is doubtful whether Bosnia, whose economy is in ruins after a
devastating war, can pay its debts.
Tukulj said the confiscation will not create shortages in
Bosnia.
But the move is likely to have political consequences.
Bosnia's Muslim-led leadership was outraged by a recent speech
by Croatian President Franjo Tudjman, in which he justified his
support for the wartime Bosnian Croat substate.
Bosnian leaders, as well as international officials, are leery
of Tudjman's intentions towards Bosnia. They interpreted his
remarks as an indication of his continued desire to annex a part of
Bosnia.
In addition, the two countries have failed to agree on terms for
Bosnia to lease part of the Ploce port.
The confiscation by INA ``looks like some kind of (political)
pressure,'' Tukulj said.
