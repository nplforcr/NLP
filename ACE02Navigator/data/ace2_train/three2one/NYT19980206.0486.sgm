The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Feb. 7:
When the subject turns to animals, most politicians turn
irrational. There is no better evidence than bills passed in
Congress dramatically changing public housing policy. Both House
and Senate versions have an avowed aim of giving more control to
the local authorities. But on one issue, both chambers went in the
opposite direction by stripping local housing administrators of the
right to ban pets from their projects.
Large dogs bred for fighting have become a safety hazard in some
projects. Even peaceable animals can turn playgrounds into health
hazards or create misery for an entire floor of tenants by barking
or using the hallways as a bathroom. Animal advocates _ with a big
assist from the pet food lobby _ say these problems should be dealt
with on a case-by-case basis. That might work well in smaller
projects or where ferocious pit bulls are not high-testosterone
status symbols. But in New York City, where more than half a
million people live in public housing, that approach fails.
Except in projects for the elderly, the New York City Housing
Authority theoretically bans dogs. But the authority actually
follows a live-and-let-live policy unless building workers or
neighbors complain that a family is keeping a dangerous or noisy
animal. Getting rid of those bad apples then becomes a long,
difficult and expensive process. The authority has had to initiate
eviction proceedings against 300 families who refused to get rid of
their animals until they were faced with immediate loss of their
apartments.
The authority will never, and should never, waste its time and
resources trying to weed out all the innocuous and beloved family
dogs. But the ban provides useful leverage against people who will
not easily agree to get rid of a pet, no matter how miserable it
makes life for the neighbors. Empowering dog-owning families with a
federal right will make it far more difficult for the authority to
win a case.
This is an issue that is simple to rectify. The legislators who
created this mess, particularly Rep. Carolyn Maloney of New York,
must encourage the conferees to kill the provision and refrain from
bringing the idea up again.
Fighting the pet lobby will not win them any votes. But it is
the responsible thing to do _ the kind of small decision that shows
the difference between a pandering politician and a serious
legislator.
