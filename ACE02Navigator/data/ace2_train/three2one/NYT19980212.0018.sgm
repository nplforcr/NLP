YAMANOUCHI, Japan _ By the time it ended, it should have been
called slushboard, not snowboard.
There was driving rain and lightning, and an official decision
to close off half the spectators' area because the ground had
become too slippery. But unlike those much more recognizable
Olympic veterans, the downhillers, the halfpipe riders spun,
flipped and soldiered on.
The first gold medal in the discipline's history went to
20-year-old Nicola Thost of Germany, who has a gift for
``amplitude.'' The first silver went to Norway's Stine Brun
Kjeldaas, and the first bronze to Shannon Dunn of Steamboat
Springs, Colo.
Dunn was on her way to a gold medal when she lost her balance as
she went into her fifth aerial maneuver and found herself staring
up the edge instead of rising high in the air. Her gaffe did not
spoil her Olympic moment. ``That was so fun,'' she said as she
waited for her scores.
In the men's halfpipe, Gian Simmen of Switzerland won the gold
medal, while Daniel Franck of Norway captured the silver. Ross
Powers of South Loudenderry, Vt., took the bronze.
