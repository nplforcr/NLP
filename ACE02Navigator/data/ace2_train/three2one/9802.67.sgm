Computer Sciences Corp. sued Computer Associates International Inc. yesterday, 
alleging that its top two executives illegally offered Computer Sciences' chief 
executive millions of dollars to support a merger offer that CSC decided to 
reject. 

The lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court as part of CSC's 
counteroffensive against Computer Associates' $ 9.8 billion hostile takeover 
bid, alleged that Computer Associates' CEO, Charles B. Wang, and its president, 
Sanjay Kumar, offered to pay Van B. Honeycutt, Computer Sciences' CEO, more than 
$ 50 million to support the offer. 

CSC also alleged that the two executives promised Honeycutt he would receive 
guaranteed stock options worth at least $ 35 million and a guaranteed seven-year 
contract with an annual base income of at least $ 2.5 million. 

Discussions about potential executive compensation are typical in merger 
negotiations. Indeed, Computer Sciences' board, as part of its takeover defense, 
has voted multimillion-dollar "golden parachute" payments to Honeycutt and 16 
other top executives should CAI win the battle. 

But Computer Sciences' suit characterized the alleged offer by the Computer 
Associates' executives as part of an "unfair, unlawful and fraudulent scheme . . 
. to acquire CSC at less than its value by employing wrongful and illegal 
means." 

A Computer Associates International spokesman said the company could not comment 
because it had not seen a copy of the lawsuit. 

Court papers filed by Computer Sciences detailed a Dec. 18, 1997, visit by Wang 
and Kumar to CSC's El Segundo, Calif., headquarters to meet with Honeycutt. 

At the meeting, according to CSC's lawsuit, they told Honeycutt, "wouldn't it be 
great if we were partners," but Honeycutt responded that CSC was not for sale. 
After some additional discussion, the suit alleged, Wang asked Honeycutt if he 
and Kumar could speak privately for five minutes, and Honeycutt left the room. 

When he returned, the suit alleges, Wang made the offer of a $ 50 million 
payment as well as the stock options and seven-year contract. 

"The conduct of defendants was an intentional, unlawful and corrupt attempt to 
buy Honeycutt's support of a transaction that only benefited CAI at the expense 
of CSC and its shareholders," the suit alleges. It said the executives' conduct 
violates California laws on commercial bribery. 

Computer Sciences asked the court to prohibit Computer Associates from 
proceeding with its proposal to acquire CSC, and from communicating with CSC's 
customers and employees about any proposed deal. 

The California company also asked that CAI be ordered to pay restitution to CSC 
"in an amount to be determined at trial." 

Computer Sciences, which employs 7,300 people at its federal systems division in 
Falls Church, named Wang, Kumar and Computer Associates as defendants in the 
suit. 

Last week, Islandia, N.Y.-based Computer Associates offered to pay $ 108 a share 
for CSC's 85 million shares outstanding, and to assume about $ 700 million in 
Computer Sciences debt. 

CSC sharply rejected the offer last Thursday, saying the deal would make "no 
business sense." 

In a letter to Wang last week, Honeycutt said Computer Sciences had "moved to 
strengthen our protections against your ill-considered and unwelcome attempt to 
force an acquisition" and that the company would "utilize every legal means 
necessary to defeat your attempt." 

Yesterday's action was part of what analysts predict will be a drawn-out 
takeover battle filled with legal maneuvering. 

"Computer Sciences is usually prone to diplomacy, but that's certainly not the 
case here," said Bob Dornan, senior vice president of Federal Sources, a 
McLean-based consulting firm. "If they go down, they're going to go down in a 
blaze of guns."
