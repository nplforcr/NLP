NAGANO, Japan _ An arbitration panel met Thursday to decide
whether to return a gold medal to a Canadian snowboarder or to
uphold the International Olympic Committee's decision to take the
medal away because the athlete tested positive for marijuana.
No decision had been reached by late morning.
Ross Rebagliati of Canada had his gold-medal-winning performance
nullified on Wednesday after the IOC's medical commission voted,
13-12, and the IOC's executive board voted, 3-2, against him.
The Canadian Olympic Association appealed, noting that the rules
of the international ski federation say that a penalty may be
imposed for a positive marijuana test but do not stipulate that a
penalty is mandatory.
``Is, or should, the IOC be a social police force?'' asked Carol
Ann Letheren, an IOC member from Canada. ``That is the question
around this drug.''
There has long been a debate in the IOC about whether marijuana
should be on the banned substances list because it is not generally
considered a performance-enhancing drug, as are anabolic steroids.
``If it's not performance-enhancing, and it's a social drug, you
wonder why it is included,'' said an IOC official who spoke on
condition of anonymity. ``But it's a question of, do you follow the
rules or don't you? How do you tell your children not to use drugs
and then say it's OK if it's a gold medalist?''
The case has spawned wicked humor worldwide and serious interest
by the Japanese police. Kyodo, the Japanese news service, said that
the Japanese police would question Rebagliati and would ask the IOC
to turn over the results of his drug test. Possession of marijuana
can carry a sentence of up to five years in jail, Kyodo reported.
Michele Verdier, a spokeswoman for the IOC, said she did not know
if the committee had turned over the test results to the police.
``I see no reason why the IOC would not cooperate with local
authorities,'' Verdier said.
Letheren said that Rebagliati told officials he had not smoked
marijuana since April 1997 and that he believed the drug had
entered his system through second-hand smoke.
In the Canadian press, the case has spawned ``Up in Smoke''
headlines and such one-liners as ``Oh, Cannabis!''
The rescinding of Rebagliati's medal has also underscored the
chaotic nature of drug enforcement within the various sports
federations that make up the IOC. Not every federation tests for
marijuana. And some believe that the IOC is embarrassing itself by
disqualifying an athlete for a drug that is not considered
performance-enhancing when it does not even have certified tests
for two drugs that are performance-enhancing and are suspected of
widespread use _ human growth hormone and erythropoietin, or EPO.

Mark Fawcett, a close friend and teammate of Rebagliati's on the
Canadian snowboarding team, said: ``This whole thing is a farce.
Nobody can understand what happened. As athletes, we have never
been informed that if we are in a situation where someone is
smoking weed, we should leave.''
Frank Carroll, coach of American figure skater Michelle Kwan,
said: ``I know it is a destructive thing. If you are an athlete,
you have to make a decision. Are you going to do that sort of thing
or be an athlete? I don't think there is room for both.''
The arbitration panel deciding Rebagliati's case is part of the
Court of Arbitration for Sport, an independent body based in
Lausanne, Switzerland, that is set up to decide legal arguments
that arise during the Winter and Summer Games.
Three arbiters deciding the case are Richard Young, an attorney
from Colorado Springs, Colo.; Jan Paulsson of Sweden, and Maria
Zuchowicz of Poland. They were chosen for their experience in
arbitration and sports law.
