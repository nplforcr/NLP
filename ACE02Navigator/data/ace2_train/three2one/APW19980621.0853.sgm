BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The U.N. official overseeing Iraq's
oil-for-food plan said Sunday he wants to speed up implementation
of a new agreement that would let Iraq sell more oil to buy
humanitarian supplies.
``We came to Iraq to discuss ... how to implement the enhanced
distribution plan and how to speed the process of approval,'' Benon
Sevan said as he arrived in Baghdad.
``They say give peace a chance, so why don't we give the
distribution plan a chance,'' he added.
Sevan, a career U.N. officer from Cyprus, said he would meet
Iraq's ministers of trade, health, education ``and all those who
are concerned.''
Iraq has been barred from exporting oil under U.N. sanctions
imposed after its invasion of Kuwait in 1990. The oil-for-food
program allows Iraq to export limited amounts of oil under a
U.N.-monitored program to raise money to import food and other
humanitarian items.
The U.N. Security Council unanimously agreed Friday to allow
Baghdad to spend dlrs 300 million of its permitted revenues to buy
spare parts for its oil industry to meet increased export targets.
Iraq initially opposed this idea, fearing it would make the
program a permanent agreement. But officials now seem ready to
discuss the enhanced program.
The oil-for-food plan permitted Iraq to sell dlrs 2 billion
worth of oil every six months when it first was implemented in
December 1996. That amount was raised to dlrs 5.2 billion this
year.
Hours before Sevan's arrival, a Baghdad newspaper accused U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan of doing nothing to fulfill his
promise to get the sanctions lifted.
Al-Thawra, newspaper of the ruling Baath Party, said in a front
page editorial that Annan had promised to work for the removal of
the embargo in a deal he signed with Iraqi leaders Feb. 23.
The February deal gave U.N. arms inspectors _ charged with
overseeing the elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction _
unconditional access to all sites in Iraq, including presidential
compounds.
The United States and Britain had threatened air and missile
strikes if Iraq did not allow the monitors into President Saddam
Hussein's palaces.
Al-Thawra's editorial reflected Iraq's frustration over the
continuation of the U.N. sanctions. It was the first time that Iraq
had accused Annan of shirking his promises.
