 NEW YORK, April 7

Two more multibillion-dollar deals by financial firms were announced today,
bolstering Wall Street's conviction that this week's marriage of Citicorp
and Travelers Group signals a new bout of merger mania.

Household International Inc., one of the nation's largest consumer lenders,
agreed to buy Beneficial Corp., another giant consumer finance company, in
an $ 8.6 billion deal. And Conseco Inc., a life and health insurer, agreed
to buy Green Tree Financial Corp. in a $ 7.6 billion arrangement.

Despite the financial deals, the overall stock market retreated from the
record high set by blue-chip stocks on Monday.

The Dow Jones industrial average declined 76.73 points, or 0.85 percent, to
8956.50, just one day after it closed above 9000 for the first time ever.
The Standard and Poor's 500-stock index fell 11.83 points, or 1.1 percent,
to 1109.55. The steepest drop came in the Nasdaq composite index, which
tumbled 30.43 points, or 1.7 percent, to 1798.71.

Money managers and analysts attributed part of the drop to fears that
corporate profits are slowing, triggered by Motorola Inc.'s warning that
its sales have been hurt by Asia's economic troubles and competition from
European rivals.

Some investors also are skeptical about the plan to merge Citicorp and
Travelers. Both stocks declined today after big gains Monday, with Citicorp
falling 15 3/8, to 165 1/8, and Travelers declining 4 5/8, to 68 3/8. Other
financial shares also dropped, including J.P. Morgan, which fell 4-11/16,
to 139-15/16.

Although today's mergers are only a fraction of the size of the $ 82
billion Citicorp-Travelers deal, they reflect the same strategic imperative
to grow in size and efficiency or lose out in the fast-changing financial
services industry.

Officials at Household International and Beneficial said in a statement
that their combination will "have the financial strength, portfolio balance
and expanded market presence that will allow us to provide superior returns
for shareholders."

"Our employees and customers will also benefit," the statement said.

Conseco and Green Tree officials said their agreement will ultimately help
secure the "Middle America consumer franchise" by offering a wider range of
insurance and financial services to 11 million middle-class customers
around the country.

"The financial services industry is converging rapidly, as recent events
make abundantly clear," said Stephen C. Hilbert, Conseco's president and
chief executive. "Traditional categories, and traditional companies, are
disappearing."

Analysts agreed, saying the new combinations add to the pressure to
consolidate and grow larger.

"This is the view in the industry, that you must be of a certain size to
remain competitive. . . . 'Bigger is better. Bigger is more efficient. You
must be big to survive,' " said Kathryn H. Bissette, a financial industry
analyst with Sterne, Agee & Leach in Atlanta. "The idea of consolidation is
well underway."

Among the likely candidates for future deals are Chase Manhattan Bank and
Merrill Lynch, which have been the subject of rumors for months. Analysts
also cited J.P. Morgan, PaineWebber and Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter as
companies that likely felt more vulnerable after the announcement by
Citicorp and Travelers.

"That deal changed the definition of 'large,' " said David Hochstim, an
equity analyst at Bear, Stearns.

Hochstim said he expects more consolidations.

"This merger suggests that almost anything can be acquired or merged. . . .
We've had three pretty significant deals in the last two days. What's next?
Four?"
