JAKARTA, Indonesia, Feb. 27-
 


James Riady, the Indonesian businessman who befriended President Clinton in 
Arkansas and became a major contributor to the Democratic Party, today denied 
allegations in a recent draft report by a Senate committee's Republican majority 
that he and his company, the Lippo Group, had ties to a Chinese government 
intelligence agency. 

In a written statement provided at the end of an interview, Riady also sought to 
clarify his relationship with former Democratic Party fund-raiser John Huang. 
The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee spent almost a year investigating many 
aspects of alleged campaign finance abuses in the 1996 presidential and 
congressional elections, including a "plan" by China to influence U.S. 
elections. 

"I did not receive any information from John that I was told was classified, or 
that I believed to be classified," Riady said in the statement. "I did not ask 
John to give me any American classified intelligence, and to the best of my 
knowledge he did not provide me with any such information." 

Riady, who is deputy chairman of the Lippo Group, one of Indonesia's largest and 
most respected conglomerates, also said Huang "did not ask me to channel any 
money to America for the purpose of gaining influence for any foreign country in 
an American election, and I did not do so." 

Huang once ran Lippo's U.S. operations. He served in the Commerce Department 
beginning in July 1994. After a Sept. 13, 1995, meeting between Riady and 
Clinton in the Oval Office, Huang moved over to the Democratic National 
Committee in December that year, where he raised money from Asian American 
donors. The Senate committee said it had "a single piece of unverified 
information" that Huang may have a direct financial relationship with the 
Chinese government. The draft report describes the alleged relationship between 
the Riady family and Chinese intelligence as "based on business interests," with 
the Riadys obtaining Chinese assistance for international business opportunities 
"in exchange for large sums of money and other help." 

Riady spoke in his 21-story office building on the outskirts of Jakarta. The 
ground rules of the interview prohibited questions on American politics or the 
family's alleged links to Chinese intelligence, such as why the family 
contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to Clinton and the Democrats, and 
why Huang was in such frequent contact with his former employers at Lippo when 
he was at the Commerce Department. 

The timing of his statement is important. Riady, an ethnic Chinese, is trying to 
project a stable image for himself and his company at a time of economic and 
social upheaval in Indonesia. 

Riady also would like to improve his image in the United States, a country he 
says he loved and admired. But in the limelight he attracted in his 15 to 20 
visits to the White House, including three to the Oval Office where he discussed 
policy matters with Clinton, he got a taste of American culture that he didn't 
bargain for, he says. 

"American values, I think I must say, have deteriorated," he said. "I think what 
you see in the television forms the image of what the truth is. Actually what it 
has become is, the perception is more important than the truth." 

So far the Senate panel's allegations appear to have left the reputation of 
Riady and his father, Mochtar, as good businessmen intact in Indonesia. Indeed, 
in a country like Indonesia, giving money to influential friends -- in this case 
President Clinton -- simply makes good business sense. 

From his office, where several framed pictures of himself with Clinton decorate 
a bookshelf and desk, Riady portrayed the Lippo Group as one of Indonesia's most 
durable companies, with an American-inspired dream of developing glittering 
shopping malls and residential communities. 

"We like to focus more on the vision that we have, and our eyes are still 
focused on that vision," he said. "We're not quite like America yet, but 
obviously that becomes our target of what we'd like to do." 

It includes expanding business in China and elsewhere. Lippo sources said 
business in China currently represents 5 percent of the company's total assets, 
but company executives predict that in two or three decades that figure could 
grow to 30 percent. 

"We have always felt that China presents extremely good long-term prospects," 
Riady said. "But that's what it is -- prospects." 

"In the short term there are lots of risks, volatility, as the government tries 
to shift and structure its economy from a basically state economy to more and 
more open economy and private enterprise," he said. "During that shift there's a 
lot of uncertainties and a lot of volatility. So what we try to do is try to 
look in the long term, but in the short term try to limit our investments to a 
manageable level." 

Despite his dreams, Riady still has to deal with the short term, namely, 
wrestling with Indonesia's economic crisis. 

A $ 43 billion bailout by the International Monetary Fund is supposed to help 
get the sprawling archipelago back on its feet, but the government has been slow 
to implement reforms. An acute money problem -- the local currency, the rupiah, 
has lost more than two-thirds of its value in the past eight months -- has many 
companies on the verge of bankruptcy because they can't pay their debts. 

In this regard, Lippo has done fairly well. Riady said that in the last two 
years the company has incurred no debt at all. 

But there are cracks in the Lippo veneer. Riady acknowledged that Lippo-owned 
banks had lost 10 percent of their deposits, and that the company's retail 
business is down 20 percent to 30 percent. 

Despite the overall economic problems plaguing Indonesia, and the resulting 
crisis of confidence, Riady still promotes the nation as "the best place for 
investments." And he says it is not true that personal connections determine 
success or failure here. 

"I think in any country connections are important because at the end of the day 
you want to know the policy directions of the government," he said. "So 
relationships and connections are important and are helpful, but I think it is 
unwise to base your business on those connections."
