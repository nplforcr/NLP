Lisbon port denies entry to leaking oil tanker
</HEADLINE>

	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ The Portuguese navy denied a leaking
crude oil tanker permission to enter port in the Azores Islands
Thursday.
	   The Singapore-registered Front Lord sprung a leak from a cracked
hull Tuesday. By nightfall Wednesday, it was trailing an 800-meter
(yard)slick for 15 kilometers (9.4 miles), Portuguese navy Cmdr.
Miguel Oliveira.
	   ``Only when we have guarantees that the leakage has stopped will
the ship be able to come into port(for repairs),'' Oliveira said by
telephone from the Azores Maritime Rescue Coordination Center.
	   The 149,000-ton vessel was in international waters, 250 miles
(400 kilometers) west of the Atlantic archipelago, which lies 1,448
kilometers (900 miles) west of mainland Portugal.
	   It was carrying almost 264,000 tons of Brent Blend crude and
appeared to be leaking oil from cargo tank number 4, according to a
statement from the Environment Ministry in Lisbon.
	   Oliveira said the ship's crew was working to halt the leak by
transferring the crude from the cracked tank into an empty one.
	   The Environment Ministry reported 10-meter (yard)-high waves in
the area and said there was some risk that the tank could split
open, spilling up to 70,000 metric tons of crude into the sea, but
there was no immediate concern of a major spill.
	   ``So far there is no cause for alarm. We are not looking at a
great environmental tragedy,'' Environment Ministry spokesman
Carlos Pires said by telephone.
	   A Portuguese navy corvette was shadowing the Front Lord but was
not in contact with the vessel, according to Oliveira.
	   A Portuguese air force plane left the Azores early Thursday and
was expected to report on the size of the slick later in the day.
	   The ship was heading for the United States, but Oliveira had no
details on its exact destination or the crew.
