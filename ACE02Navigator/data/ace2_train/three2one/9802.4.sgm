President Clinton's latest emissary to Indonesia, Walter F. Mondale, leaves for 
Jakarta today to warn President Suharto against deviating from his pledge of 
economic reforms -- but also to admonish that Indonesia's problems now go far 
deeper than economics. 

The visit by Mondale, the former vice president and ambassador to Japan, comes 
as concern mounts among officials of the Clinton administration and the 
International Monetary Fund that Suharto is reverting to old-style favoritism 
toward cronies and relatives, flouting commitments he made to the IMF in 
exchange for a $ 43 billion international bailout. 

If the Indonesian leader is to lure back the capital that has fled his country, 
these officials argue, he must not only follow the IMF's prescriptions, but take 
political steps to inspire confidence among investors that Indonesia is headed 
on a long-term reform path that will minimize the risk of a social explosion. 
Officials were reluctant to specify what political measures Mondale might 
recommend, but Washington has urged the authoritarian Suharto for years to 
welcome a greater diversity of views in his government and rely less on the 
tight circle that benefits economically from the present system. 

"We want Indonesia to stabilize and grow again," a senior administration 
official said. "But we're also quite convinced that in order to do it, they have 
to recommit, both in word and deed to the IMF program -- and to make sure that 
they are fostering a political situation that can sustain that program." 

But Mondale will have a tough sell, officials admit. Even if Suharto follows 
Washington's advice, it is far from clear that Indonesia will recover anytime 
soon from a crisis that has sent inflation and joblessness soaring, sparking 
violence by resentful members of Indonesia's Muslim majority against the wealthy 
ethnic Chinese minority. 

The 76-year-old Suharto is deeply disillusioned by the failure of the IMF 
bailout to improve the economic outlook, according to officials who have spoken 
with him. Following a visit last month by Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. 
Summers and the IMF's two top officials, Suharto signed an expanded list of 
promises to dismantle monopolies and end subsidies that favor his children and 
tycoon friends. His reward from international investors: The nation's currency, 
the rupiah, plunged to new depths. 

U.S. and IMF officials contend that Suharto is to blame for undermining investor 
confidence. Cartels that were supposed to be eliminated have been revived under 
new guises. The independent-minded central bank governor was fired, and the 
government began considering establishing a "currency board" that would rigidly 
fix the value of the rupiah against the U.S. dollar -- a move Washington 
dismissed as unworkable. 

Another problem is that many ethnic Chinese, who have funneled their money to 
Singapore and other havens, are reluctant to bring their wealth back to 
Indonesia because of the anti-Chinese rioting. So long as the specter of 
violence continues to loom, their lack of confidence in Indonesia may persist, 
regardless of what reform measures Suharto embraces.
