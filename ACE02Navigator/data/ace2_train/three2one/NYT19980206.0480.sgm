NAGANO, Japan _ It has been a long time since the Best Games
Ever were held _ in Lillehammer, Norway, in February 1994, if any
of us can remember back that far.
When Juan Antonio Samaranch proclaimed the 1996 T-Shirt Shack
Jubilee as the greatest Games ever held in Fulton County, Ga., the
damnation by faint praise did not escape the locals.
It is a well-known fact that Samaranch, the president of the
International Olympic Committee, is so multilingual that he can
surely say ``Best Games Ever'' in dozens of African languages,
Mandarin and Cantonese, Iroquois, Finnish and Hindi, and is fairly
aching to bestow these honors in Japanese.
The potentially Best Games Ever were opened Saturday, the
closest to the equator the Winter Games have ever been held, in a
town allegedly with palm trees. However, there is more than enough
snow on the mountains ringing Almost Heaven, West Nagano.
This prosaic and friendly little city, elevated to Olympic
status by the wisdom of the IOC delegates, did its best Saturday on
a warm and sunny morning, with a decidedly Japanese touch that
included sumo wrestlers, ceremonial wooden pillars, and a real-life
emperor and empress.
There was also a shadow hanging over the opening, the threat of
a major military action by the United States against Iraq in the
next week or two unless there is some resolution to the standoff
concerning United Nations inspections of suspected weapon sites.
In the past, Samaranch has made open appeals to ``Please, stop
the fighting,'' to whomever was fighting at the moment. There's
always somebody, isn't there? He used whatever cachet the Olympic
movement has to call for peace in the former Yugoslavia in 1994 as
the Winter Games took place in the peaceful snowy hills of Norway.
Then there were candles flickering along the Storgata, the main
street of rustic Lillehammer and intense Norwegians collecting
signatures, and Samaranch visited Sarajevo, a sister Olympic city.
However, Baghdad is not an Olympic city, and while Samaranch once
again called for peace in the world this morning, he seemed to know
he was not going to talk the United States out of doing whatever it
is going to do.
``Our force is limited, as you know,'' Samaranch said Friday.
``Somebody asked if I contacted President Clinton. The last time we
spoke was during the Atlanta Olympic Games. President Clinton is a
great president, an outstanding politician, and I am sure he will
find diplomatic means to convince Iraq's president to respect
international law.''
In the not-so-distant past, U.S. presidents and Russian
presidents and Cuban presidents have deprived their athletes of the
chance to compete, in order to make some protest or political
stand. Now Samaranch seemed to be saying, ``Please, stop the
politics.'' He was going to run a sporting event with global
ramifications and leave the politics to the bombers and the
bombees.
Samaranch may also be fighting a difficult battle against doping
_ ``a kind of cheating that we cannot afford,'' he called it. The
Chinese seem to be carrying around trunkfuls of
performance-enhancing chemicals, most recently to the world
swimming championships in Perth, Australia, where their stash was
uncovered almost by accident by a customs inspection. This week
Samaranch voiced the hope that customs officials around the world
would aid in the struggle.
However, the Olympic movement has a dilemma with its rigid
testing for performance-enhancing drugs. Samaranch has eagerly
opened the Games up to wealthy professionals who are not policed
particularly strongly in their leagues.
It's merely a personal disgrace when a Ben Johnson loses his
gold medal in the 100 meters for testing positive, but it would be
extremely bad business if a basketball or hockey player should test
positive for something that is not ordinarily supervised in his
league.
Samaranch may have found a battle he can win _ gender equity.
Under his stewardship, the Summer and Winter Games have
consistently been opened to female athletes, and this past week he
made strong demands for more females, even suggesting minimal
quotas, like 10 percent for female officials by the year 2000. In
the meantime, Samaranch and the spectators could only sit back and
enjoy the opening ceremony.
``I remember coming over the hill and hearing the cheers getting
louder,'' recalled Anita DeFrantz, the IOC delegate who won a
bronze medal as a rower for the United States in 1976 in Montreal.
``Then we came into the stadium, and there was a roar.''
There would be another roar Saturday _ at the start of what
everybody hoped would be the Best Games Ever. It has been a long
time.
