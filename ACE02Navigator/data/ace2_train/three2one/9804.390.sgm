 PARIS, April 3

Jean-Marie Le Pen, the leader of France's far-right National Front party,
today said he will appeal a court ruling denying him the right to hold
office for two years, hinting at a government scheme to suppress his
movement when it is showing its latest ripple of strength.

"It's only in totalitarian countries that courts are used to eliminate
political adversaries of the powerful," Le Pen said the morning after a
judge in Versailles ruled that Le Pen had shoved and insulted a Socialist
candidate running against his daughter in last year's national legislative
campaign.

The incident occurred in Mantes-la-Jolie, in a tightly-contested district
near Paris, at a rally for Marie-Caroline Le Pen, the National Front
candidate. Witnesses and video footage indicated that Le Pen and his bodyguards had accosted a group of counter-demonstrators that included
Annette Peulvast-Bergeal, the Socialist candidate and eventual victor in
the district.

"We've had it up to here with you," Le Pen told Peulvast-Bergeal, yanking
the tricolor scarf around her neck and pushing her to the ground, shaking
off efforts to break up the melee. He and his bodyguards also punched and
verbally abused other demonstrators, the court found. Later, Le Pen, 69, a
former paratroop commander in Algeria, was quoted as saying, "That made me
feel younger."

The judge's ruling also stripped Le Pen of the right to vote for two years,
fined him $ 3,800 and gave him a three-month suspended prison sentence. The
judgment could force Le Pen to give up his seat in the European Parliament
and his place on the regional governing council in southern France, where
the National Front's political base is.

Le Pen's status in the European Parliament may not protect him from
prosecution by German authorities for another incident, in Munich last
December, when Le Pen repeated a favored belief that the systematic
extermination of 6 million Jews by the Nazis would be remembered as a
"detail" of history.

The prosecutor's office in Munich asked the German government today to lift
Le Pen's parliamentary immunity so it can prosecute him for inciting racial
hatred. The request is to be referred to the European Parliament, where Le
Pen is one of 11 National Front members.

A French court in December fined Le Pen $ 50,000 for the Munich statement,
which was nearly identical to one he made in France 11 years ago, for which
he was fined $ 200,000. He and other National Front leaders have been
censured frequently by French courts for making antisemitic or racist
remarks.

Le Pen's party, which these days draws 15 percent of the vote in French
elections by espousing a credo of French nationalism and racial purity, has
roiled the political waters here in recent weeks.

The center-right presidents of three regional councils elected March 15
have wrested power from Socialists, the top vote-getters, by accepting the
support of National Front councillors. The controversial deals were the
first concrete admission by the French mainstream right that it may have to
do political business with a party the French Establishment is loath even
to recognize.

President Jacques Chirac, responding to the crisis unleashed by the
National Front's inroads on the regional level, is trying to formulate a
"renewal" of the French political system and, less overtly, a rescue of the
political right that includes his own battered party.

Chirac's ongoing discussions with top political figures across most of the
spectrum do not include any consultations with the National Front.
