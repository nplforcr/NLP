Proceedings about to get under way in 40 minutes from now.
We welcome Michael gerhardt joins us throughout.
Mike and I, seen joined by Jeff Greenfield.
Folks let's talk about the bipartisan we heard talk about.
In the end if this comes down to a straight party vote, the president
wouldn't be convicted and there wouldn't be bipartisanship.
In the end as we saw with Andrew Johnson there were radical republicans who
saved the party by one vote.
What has to happen to get to that model again.
<TURN>
I think as you pointed out radical republicans broke with the party and
voted to acquit President Johnson was a defining moment for that event.
That helps us understand that particular event.
But I think something dramatic, something different, new is going to have
to happen here, that would probably lead to a greater sort of
bipartisanship than we have seen thus far.
<TURN>
My own feeling is that a party line vote will be seen as just that.
And therefore, I'm trying to picture what happens after a certain stage in
this trial.
For instance, after the presentation and prewitness one could imagine 6
republicans the northeast moderates we've heard so much about saying enough
already and voting to adjourn the trial.
The converse, the idea of democrats breaking with the president to convict.
You almost can't imagine that happening without witnesses showing up and
saying something or behaving with demeanor in such a way that democrats who
are disposed to vote with the president suddenly say uo something worse
happened.
The republican move earlier to adjourn and the democratic drift to break
with the president.

Michael let me ask you about expectations for today.
How will this be like a conventional trial, how will it be dissimilar.
<TURN>
Very dissimilar.
It's helpful.
This is different in many respects.
You have the chief justice presiding over this proceeding, he doesn't
proceed over trial-like proceedings.
You have the senators mute.
They are acting as more man just jurors.
This is their proceeding, they are in control of the the direction of this
proceeding.
They can end it or prolong it at any point.
That makes this very different.
Moreover, the house managers and the had thes lawyers will be constrained
in a certain respect with what they can present.
They will be able to present things only to the extent the senators allow
them to present those things this will have a different dynamic.
