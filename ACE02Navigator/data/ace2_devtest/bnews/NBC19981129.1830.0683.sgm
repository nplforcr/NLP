Now to the long fight to arrest and put on trial the two men suspected of
bombing Pan Am Flight 103 ten years ago.
Tonight, the U.N. secretary general is trying to determine whether his
personal involvement can make that happen.

The image is lasting and haunting -- the wreckage of Pan Am
Flight 103, scattered over Lockerbie, Scotland.
270 people, including 189 Americans, many coming home for the holidays,
were killed.
Investigators said a bomb hidden in a radio destroyed the jet at 31,000
feet.
They also concluded two Libyan intelligence agents planted the bomb, but
libya refused to turn the suspects over to either Britain or the U.S. for
trial.
Since 1994, Libyan leader Moammar qadaffi has offered to turn the suspects
over to various third countries, offers America and Britain repeatedly
rejected.
Now, as the tenth anniversary of the Pan Am bombing draws near, a policy
shift.
The U.S. and Britain are challenging Libya to make good on an offer to try
the suspects before a Scottish court in the Netherlands.
And U.N. secretary-general Kofi Annan says he's prepared to meet with
qadaffi if he feels lybia's leader is finally prepared to let the suspects
face trial.

The question has been raised if it would be helpful for me to go there and
bring the issue finally to closure.
I haven't made up my mind yet, but it has not been excluded.

To bert Ammerman, who lost his brother Tom on Pan Am Flight 103,
the idea of the secretary-general mediating a possible handover makes
sense.
<TURN>
Time will tell but I am optimistic that we will finally see justice.

Rosemary wolf, who lost a stepdaughter, disagrees.

I think that we would be playing into qadaffi's hands.
I think Annan would be playing into his hands.
Qadaffi is using the U.N., as well as anybody else that he can get a hold
of, to Foster his own purposes.

The families, who gather every December to mourn their loss, are
united in their grief.
