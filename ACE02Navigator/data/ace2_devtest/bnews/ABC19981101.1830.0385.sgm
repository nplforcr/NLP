President Clinton is not running in Tuesday's election, but he's a factor
in nearly every race.
We asked political reporters and analysts from around the country about the
races to watch.

This Clinton business has really helped both parties.
Hard core republicans and social conservatives are angry at president
clinton over this, and hard core democrats and liberals are angry at
congress over this.
In Illinois, Carol Moseley Braun is in trouble.
She's had a number of ethical issues in her performance in office.
Sometimes when you become the issue in a campaign, it's awful hard to
change the subject.

One of the big stories in the northeast is voter turnout this year.
In Massachusetts, for example, the secretary of state has predicted we're
going to have the lowest turnout since world war II in terms of percentage.
The Senate race pits senator Alfonse D'Amato, republican, against
congressman Chuck Schumer.
It's the first time D'Amato has an opponent who could beat him and that has
enormous repercussion for the Senate.
<TURN>
I think the single most important race out west, anywhere in the country,
most would agree, is the race for California governor.
You have democratic governor Gray Davis running quite far ahead in the
polls against republican attorney general Dan Lungren.
The governor, who is elected on Tuesday, will preside over reapportionment,
the once every decade redrawing of political boundaries.
So for that reason alone, California governor's race is going to have a
Very important and significant impact on the house well into the next
decade.
<TURN>
I think the election of the bush brothers Tuesday night will probably be
the most important signal coming out of the south.
George W. bush appears to be winning in Texas.
If he wins big, that's going to be an impressive victory and put him up for
the republican nomination in 2000.
If his brother, Jeb bush, can win also in Florida, then republicans will
come in control of the two largest states in the south.
And I think that would be the major political event occurring in the south.
