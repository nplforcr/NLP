The script for the remake of the classic Hollywood musical "The King and I"
has been rejected again by film authorities in Thailand. They say the
revised script still contains historical inaccuracies, which are insulting
to the Thai monarchy. The film tells the story of an English woman who
taught the children of a Thai king in the mid-19th century. It's now likely
the film will be shot in Malaysia. From the BBC NewsRoom in London, this
is Pamela McCall with the world.
