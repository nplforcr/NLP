At a time when the volume of foreign news is dwindling, networks
are eliminating foreign news bureaus and newspapers are downplaying
reports from overseas, a dozen news organizations are making
considerable effort to open news bureaus in Cuba.
Even with some increased access in recent years, the press has
been allowed, at best, irregular glimpses into the Western
Hemisphere's only communist society. With the news Friday that the
Cuban government will permit the Associated Press to station a
permanent correspondent in Havana _ for the first time since the AP
was expelled in 1969 _ other news organizations have some renewed
hope of success.
``We've had reporters designated as Cuban correspondents, going
down as often as we can,'' said Ann Marie Lipinski, managing editor
of The Chicago Tribune. ``It's been an ongoing part of our foreign
report. We'd like to make it a permanent dateline.''
In addition to The Tribune, three Florida newspapers, three
national broadcast television networks and the Univision
Spanish-language network, along with The Wall Street Journal, The
New York Times and Cox newspapers have all sought permission to
open bureaus in Havana.
Because of federal prohibitions against U.S. firms' doing
business with the communist regime of Fidel Castro, the news
organizations have sought, and obtained, waivers from the
government allowing them to open Cuban offices.
The hard part is getting the Cuban government to agree. While it
has granted temporary visas to American correspondents for
individual reporting trips, the only American news organization to
win permission for a permanent correspondent has been CNN.
Other news organizations, like The Miami Herald, have provided
coverage offensive enough to the Cuban government that they are
seldom granted even temporary visas. During a two-year visa
drought, The Herald has made do by sending correspondents in on
tourist visas.
``We cover Cuba without physically going there officially _ we
go in surreptitiously,'' Herald Executive Editor Douglas Clifton
said. ``We don't like to, but it's one of the things we do.'' He
pointed out that Miami has ``a massive Cuban population hungry for
news from Cuba.''
That population of first-, second- and third-generation Cubans,
which numbers upwards of 1 million people in Dade, Broward and Palm
Beach counties on Florida's southeast coast, is a rich source of
potential readers for newspapers in the area. The Herald, owned by
Knight Ridder, is vying with the Tribune Co.'s Sun-Sentinel of Fort
Lauderdale for readers north of Miami. Both newspapers are among
those that have received U.S. _ but not Cuban _ permission to open
bureaus in Havana.
Clifton was part of a delegation of American newspaper editors
who last month traveled to Cuba, met Fidel Castro and raised the
issue of new bureaus. ``The answer he gave suggested strongly that
he had no interest,'' Clifton said. ``That it didn't serve their
purposes. That sometimes journalists were not really what they
cracked up to be. Sometimes they were more spies than reporters.
``So we walked away from it feeling it was a bleak outcome,'' he
said.
