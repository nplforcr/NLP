MOSCOW (AP) _ More than 3,250 new cases of HIV have been
registered in Russia this year, and 90 percent of those who
contracted the virus were intravenous drug users, the health
minister said Thursday.
The new cases bring the total number of people with HIV in
Russia to 10,283, including 418 children, Health Minister Vladimir
Starodubov said, according to the Interfax news agency.
More than 220 Russians have died of AIDS since the disease was
first detected here in 1987, including 77 children, Starodubov
said.
Russian officials warn that the actual number of HIV cases may
be up to 10 times higher, as Russia still lacks comprehensive
diagnostic and treatment programs.
While this year's figure appear to mark a decrease in new HIV
cases from 1997, when 4,300 new cases were registered, Starodubov
warned that the virus may spread faster in the next few years if
living standards continue to decline, bringing a rise in drug use
and prostitution.
Officials say more than 90 percent of people testing positive
for HIV are intravenous drug users who have caught the virus
through infected syringes.
