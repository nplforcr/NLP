LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) _ Three of Pakistan's top cricket players
denied taking money to throw matches when they appeared Saturday
before a judicial inquiry into allegations of match fixing.
Leading batsmen Saeed Anwar and Inzamamul Haq and spin bowler
Mushtaq Ahmed told the inquiry that they had no links with
bookmakers.
A judicial inquiry is being held into accusations that senior
Pakistani cricketers, including two former captains, Wasim Akram
and Saleem Malik, fixed matches. The accusations were leveled by
some of their team mates and Australian cricketers.
They have denied the charge.
Anwar said he received two telephone calls from bookmakers who
offered him bribes to play poorly during Pakistan's tour of Sri
Lanka in 1994.
``I refused the offer and reported it to the officials of the
cricket board,'' he said. He also said the bookmakers warned him
against disclosing the offer.
Anwar said he also heard rumors that some cricket players had
links with bookmakers, but he had no information on that. He also
said Malik did not offer him a bribe.
Ahmed, who denied being involved in match fixing, was warned by
the judge: ``If you lie, your career will end.''
Haq contradicted earlier testimony by team manager Intikhab Alam
that he had the players swear on the Koran _ the Muslim holy book _
that they would not throw the matches during a foreign tour.
The judge ordered Haq to return to give more testimony on Nov.
11.
Earlier this month Australian captain Mark Taylor and Mark Waugh
appeared before the tribunal to record their statements.
Waugh told the court he was offered thousands of dollars by
Malik which he turned down.
