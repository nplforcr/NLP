SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Yemen faced criticism Wednesday after its
troops stormed the hideout of Islamic extremist kidnappers holding
16 Western hostages. Four of the hostages were killed.
Two hostages were wounded during the siege near the southern
town of Mawdiyah, about 175 miles (280 kilometers) south of the
capital, San`a.
The remaining 10 hostages were freed unharmed. Three kidnappers
died.
Yemen's Interior Ministry blamed the kidnappers for the deaths
of the three Britons and an Australian, one of whom died later in
in a hospital. It said security forces intervened after the
kidnappers began killing the hostages.
