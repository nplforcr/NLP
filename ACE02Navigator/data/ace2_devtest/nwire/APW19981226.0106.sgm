Primakov hails budget passage

MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov on Saturday
praised Russian lawmakers' speedy initial approval of the draft
1999 budget, calling the vote ``a victory for common sense.''
Russia's lower house of parliament, the State Duma, showed
widespread support for Primakov's government by voting in favor of
the 1999 budget's first draft on Thursday.
Primakov had said the government needed a budget as soon as
possible to turn around Russia's economic slide and begin paying
billions of rubles (dollars) in unpaid salaries.
The budget passage is ``a victory for common sense, a victory
for compromise,'' he said, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
``We are finding a common language, a common approach. And we
will further work intensively with the lawmakers,'' he said.
Still, some lawmakers have serious problems with the draft.
Primakov met with regional governors Saturday, who say the budget
unfairly distributes tax revenue between the regions and the
federal government.
The regional governors make up Russia's upper house of
parliament, the Federation Council, which must also approve the
budget. In the past, the Duma, not the governors, have put up the
strongest fight over the budget.
Primakov sounded optimistic about avoiding a standoff with the
governors, and said the budget now calls for the federal government
to split revenues down the middle.
``We have approached a balance on interests and an optimal
distribution of revenues between the federal center and regions,''
Primakov said, according to ITAR-Tass.
Russia's economy plunged in August when the government stopped
propping up the ruble and defaulted on some of its domestic debt.
State employers haven't paid many wages on time for years, and the
latest crisis only worsened the problem.
When he was selected as Prime Minister in September, Primakov
made paying back wages one of his top priorities. But he has been
unable to overcome the country's mounting salary debts, which total
roughly 80 billion rubles (dlrs 4.1 billion).
``This is the question of questions, and attention to it must on
be lessened,'' he said of the wage crisis on Saturday.
