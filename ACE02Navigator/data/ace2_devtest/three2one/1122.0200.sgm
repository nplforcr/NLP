HEADLINE:  Transit Is on Par With 3 'Model' Systems, Study Finds

While London, Paris and Tokyo are often praised for the quality of their public 
transportation systems, a new report suggests that the New York region fares 
surprisingly well in the efficiency of its trains, buses and subways when 
compared with these cities. 

The report, based on a joint three-year study by groups in the four urban areas, 
concludes that these mass transit systems share many common attributes and 
problems, including highly centralized rail networks, growing business centers 
at their urban cores, huge populations of commuters and severe automobile 
congestion. 

In some respects, mass transit in the New York region compares poorly, 
particularly in the paucity of service to much of its suburban ring, which 
forces suburban residents to rely on cars, according to the report. 

But for New Yorkers who hold to a commonly held view that the largest cities of 
Europe, particularly Paris and London, have model mass transit systems, the 
findings of the four-city study may come as a shock. 

''One thing it shows is that New York has made a good recovery in the last 30 
years in the efficiency of its rail and subway systems,'' said Bill Shore, a 
senior associate with the Institute of Public Transportation, a New York City 
research group that carried out the New York component of the study. 

For instance, the New York region's commuter trains, including Metro-North, the 
Long Island Rail Road and New Jersey Transit, were found to be more punctual 
than those in the other metropolitan areas. (New York's subways, however, proved 
less punctual.) All three New York regional commuter train systems were found to 
be punctual more than 90 percent of the time, while the regional rail network 
around London, long lauded as a model of efficiency, registered only 88 percent 
on the punctuality scale. 

The report, released last week in the form of a thick compendium of charts, 
numerical rankings and other forms of comparative analysis, was the largest 
study comparing what are perhaps the world's most advanced large cities in terms 
of mass transit, its authors say. 

The other groups participating in the study were the London Research Centre, the 
Institut d'Amenagement et d'Urbanisme de la Region d'Ile-de-France of Paris and 
the Tokyo Institute for Municipal Research, all of which received government or 
philanthropic grants in their own countries. 

While providing a broad portrait of the vast transportation systems in each 
metropolitan area and the challenges those regions face from urban sprawl, air 
pollution and other problems, the study provides many reminders of the 
differences in how people commute. 

For instance, more than 500,000 people ride motorcycles into Tokyo each day, 
about 5 percent of its commuting population. But the report found that only 
about 10,000 motorcyclists brave the New York region's highways each day, so 
negligible a number that the report called it zero percent of the total. 

According to the study's authors, far more important conclusions reveal a 
combination of similarities in transit patterns and huge problems that must be 
confronted. 

Among the comparative findings was that New York City subways trailed their 
foreign counterparts in punctuality, with 80 percent of the subways arriving 
close to their scheduled arrival time. By that measure, Tokyo's metro system 
came out on top, with 97 percent of its trains on time. 

The report found a big difference among the four regions in the breadth of their 
mass transit networks. While the New York City subway system has far more 
stations than its foreign counterparts, the report found that its suburban rail 
network had far fewer stations. 

Mr. Shore said his group had concluded that the biggest challenge for the New 
York region, as revealed by the three-year study, was finding ways to lure more 
suburban residents onto trains and other forms of public transportation at a 
time when there is little hope that extensive new suburban rail lines will be 
built. 

Near-term approaches to the problem, he said, may include providing better bus 
connections and more parking at suburban train stations. 

But he said the vast scale of the problem was more likely to require changes in 
land-use planning and the rules governing development. The objective, he said, 
should be to confine development to places already served by mass transit, 
instead of extending the limits of suburban sprawl farther from existing rail 
stations or bus lines. 

''The only solution appears to be in finding a way to better relate housing and 
jobs to existing public transportation,'' he said.
