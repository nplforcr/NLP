President Clinton says there's a serious problem in minority communities,
and he wants something done about it.
He says AIDS is a severe and ongoing health care crisis among the groups.
And today he's unveiling a $156 million program to prevent and treat the
disease.
Louise Schiavone takes a closer look at the problem.

Elsie Carter of Washington has had AIDS for three years.
She's not sure if she was infected through intravenous drug use or
prostitution.
<TURN>
To be truthful, I didn't care.
All I wanted was something that was gonna make me feel better than what I
was feeling.
And I was hurting a lot back then.

Though the road to HIV is paved with intravenous drug use and
unprotected sex, these issues have been taboo subjects in the
african-American culture.
<TURN>
We have a code of silence, and we just don't like to talk about those
things.
And the reality is, silence equals death.

Leaders in the African-American community believe the rapid
spread of AIDS among blacks has created a national health emergency.
<TURN>
What is most striking about this whole situation is that every hour seven
americans become infected with HIV.
Three of those seven Americans are African-American.

That's why political pressure has been brought to bear by the
congressional black caucus, black doctors and others in the minority AIDS
network.
The figures contrast sharply with the 47% decline in AIDS deaths in the
overall population last year.
Leaders say access to health care may not be as big an issue as trust in
the health system, sticking to a medical regimen and changing bad habits.
They hope federal dollars for education, prevention and treatment will be
part of the cure.
Louise Schiavone, for CNN, Washington.
