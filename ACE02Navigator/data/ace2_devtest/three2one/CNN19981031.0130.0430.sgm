President Clinton was in New York Friday to give democratic congressman
charles Schumer a last-minute campaign boost.
Schumer is challenging incumbent republican senator Alfonse D'Amato in a
Heavily-watched contest.
The president urged Americans to vote, saying democrats like Schumer may
mean the difference in whether the government can save social security.
The latest polls show Schumer has a slight lead in a race that has turned
increasingly bitter.
Friday, vice President Gore lashed out at house speaker Newt Gingrich,
accusing him of orchestrating a $10 million ad campaign to exploit the
monica Lewinsky issue.
<TURN>
Personal, partisan attacks aimed at the president of the United States,
written and devised by speaker Gingrich just a few days before the
election, is just a smokescreen to avoid discussion of the real issues.
And I think the American people have served notice that they don't like
that kind of approach, and I think you'll see a reaction.
