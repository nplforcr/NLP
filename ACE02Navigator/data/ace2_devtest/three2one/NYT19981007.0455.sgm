WASHINGTON _ Members of Congress expressed doubts about Russia's
continued role in the international space station Wednesday as NASA
officials defended plans to help Russia finish important components
of the program and reduce future dependence on the cash-strapped
nation in completing the orbiting outpost.
NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin said plans to pay Russia $660
million over four years for equipment and services connected with
the space station were necessary to save the multinational project,
and that additional money would be needed to pay other added costs,
most of them caused by Russia's financial problems.
Goldin told a House Science Committee hearing that Russia was a
valuable partner in the space station program, but that the agency
shared the concerns of many members of Congress that the collapse
of the Russian economy threatened that nation's major contributions
to the project.
``Our reliance on Russian capabilities has to be reduced, not by
eliminating their involvement but by adding layers of protection,''
he said.
The bailout money, $60 million of which is needed immediately,
is necessary to insure that the Russian-built service module, the
crucial third component of the modular space station, is completed
and ready for launching in July 1999, three months after an April
1999 date set earlier this year.
Goldin said the $60 million was not a gift to Russia and would
buy the United States added storage space and research time on
Russian components of the station.
Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., who chairs the committee,
criticized the National Aeronautics and Space Administration for
making Russia a partner in the project and letting the troubled
nation have such a crucial role. Sensenbrenner said NASA had
assured Congress for years that it was taking steps to insure that
Russia would not be in such a critical position in the station
project that its problems would endanger completion of the station.
``The White House does not want to admit that its management of
our relationship with Russia is fundamentally flawed,''
Sensenbrenner said.
``The president promised me in writing in 1994 that we would not
be dependent on the Russians to build the international space
station,'' he continued, ``And now the administration wants to
stick the American taxpayer with the costs of its mistakes, just to
hide the fact that it made them.''
Rep. Tim Roemer, D-Ind., a longtime critic of the space station,
repeated his call to cancel the project. He noted that a recent
NASA audit estimated that each month's delay in the project cost
U.S. taxpayers at least $130 million, and predicted even more
delays because of Russia's money problems.
Judyth Twigg, an expert in Russian affairs at Virginia
Commonwealth University in Richmond, Va., told the hearing that
Russia's problems run deeper than just a lack of money. Since the
breakup of the Soviet Union, Russia has not been conducting
meaningful research and development in space and its industrial
capacity has declined.
White House science adviser Neal Lane said after the hearing
that Russia is experiencing more financial problems than anyone
anticipated when it became a partner in the space station program
four years ago. ``We want to work with them on the problems,'' he
said, adding that the administration was examining requests from
NASA for more money in future budgets to cover increased project
costs.
Goldin said partners in the $40 billion space station project,
including the European Space Agency, Japan and Canada, agreed last
week to stay on schedule for launching the first two parts of the
station. Critics have questioned the wisdom of putting the first
two elements of the project into orbit this year and then having to
wait months for the much-delayed Russian service module.
Russian Space Agency officials announced Wednesday that they
have started launching preparations for the first element, an
unmanned maneuver and storage unit named Zarya. The module, built
in Russia but paid for by the United States, is to be launched Nov.
20 on a Russian rocket. It is to be followed on Dec. 3 by the
launching of the space shuttle Endeavour carrying the first U.S.
element, a connecting module called Unity.
James Oberg of Houston, an expert on the Russian space program,
told the hearing that too many doubts remain about the readiness of
the service module and other Russian-made components to launch the
first elements of the station.
It would be a mistake, Oberg said, to begin launching elements
before re-evaluating options for the program, including one that
excludes Russian involvement.
