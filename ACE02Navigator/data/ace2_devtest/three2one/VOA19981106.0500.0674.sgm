In the United States, an organization known as the Feminist Majority has
launched a campaign on behalf of women in Afghanistan that it alleges are
mistreated by the ruling Taliban. Mavis Leno is a member of the
organization's board and the wife of the popular television comedian Jay
Leno. She spoke with VOA's Tom Crosby and told him that for her, it was the
right time to take up the cause of the women in that country.

A lot of things that I was interested in and felt strongly about coalesced
at one time. I had joined the Feminist Majority because I wanted to
basically make sure of three things. I wanted to make sure that the
advances women have made in America in this century don't roll back, as
they have before. I want to make sure that a new generation of
feminist-oriented young women grow up with help from those of us who were
in the front lines in the '70s. And the Feminist Majority handles both
those issues. And I also had felt for a long time that American women were
in a strong enough position now to look to women in third world countries
and offer them a helping hand. And so when I heard what was going on in
Afghanistan, which I first learned about when I joined the board of the
Feminist Majority, everything fell into place.

Once you got involved in this, did you get any response from the people of
Afghanistan themselves?

It's very difficult to get response from the people inside Afghanistan
because the Taliban have cut off pretty much all the means by which people
could communicate. They don't allow TV, they don't allow foreign observers
in. They really -- if they didn't need money so badly, which they do, they
probably would do what Albania did and just completely sever their links
with the rest of the world. However, I have spoken to many, many people who
are emigres from Afghanistan and are trying desperately to do something
about the plight of their country, and a lot of people that I've spoken to
work with the women in the refugee camps who fled Afghanistan after the
takeover and are now living in camps in Pakistan. And these people honestly
feel, these women, that America, the West, is their last chance. One woman
said in the course of the -- a highly illegal interview that she gave --
anonymously, of course -- that the women of Afghanistan are the walking
dead. So unless we can get them out, there's very little chance for them to
be gotten out.
