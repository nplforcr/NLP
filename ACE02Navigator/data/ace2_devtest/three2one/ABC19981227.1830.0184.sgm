What does it take to keep severely premature infants alive?
ABC's Jamie Floyd spent this day at a hospital unit that specializes in
treating the tiniest human beings.

For the parents of premature babies, a normally happy event can
be an ordeal.
Parents must spend the first few weeks of their babies' lives with doctors,
nurses.
<TURN>
Each baby has team in a 24-hour period probably of eight to ten people who
are taking care of it.
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> Reporter: </ANNOTATION>
And lots of equipment.
<TURN>
It takes medical time and it takes a huge amount of equipment on this baby.
And probably per pound, this is the most expensive patient in the hospital
to take care of.

<ANNOTATION> Reporter: </ANNOTATION>
Dr. Warren rosenfeld is a neonatalogist.
He says the smaller the baby, the harder it is to keep alive.
<TURN>
We're not measuring things in pounds anymore, but in ounces, and each drop
in an once makes the baby usually more immature and the systems within the
baby's body are really not developed.
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> Reporter: </ANNOTATION>
Together, counting odera, the Houston octuplets weighed a little
more than ten pounds.
According to the hospital where odera was born, she was the size of a
Beanie baby.
Doctors call such babies micropreemies.
<TURN>
You can see that this baby would easily fit in the palm of my hand.
And this baby is over two pounds.
This is 3 or 3 1/2 times the size of a baby who weighs ten ounces.
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> Reporter: </ANNOTATION>
These babies face an uphill battle.
<TURN>
We always worry first about the lungs, the second is the brain.
Then we worry about the heart.
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> Reporter: </ANNOTATION>
Doctors have to re-create the environment of the womb outside the
womb.
<TURN>
The uterus is made to hold a term baby of about six to eight pounds.
And when you start crowding more babies into the uterus, the amount of
weight or the size to which the uterus can grow and the babies can grow are
limited.
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> Reporter: </ANNOTATION>
So the surviving chukwu babies face greater challenges than other
premature babies.
<TURN>
We don't have all the answers.
And we're going to need many years more before we have the answer for
ten-ounce babies.
