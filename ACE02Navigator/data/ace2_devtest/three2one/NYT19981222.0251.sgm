At the Container Store, a Dallas-based chain that specializes in
storage products and closet organizers, employees do far more than
ring up sales. They are trained to think of themselves as
counselors or problem-solvers _ whether the issue is a shared
closet that must house one spouse's 34 pairs of shoes or a child's
room spilling over with an unmanageable number of toys.
``We've had customers come up to us and say, `This is better
than a visit to my shrink,''' said Garrett Boone, the chief
executive.
The company, which has 19 stores around the country, considers
customer service a ``core competency,'' not a frill, and trains
sales clerks for 185 hours the first year; the industry average is
below 10. And the company often hires its best customers,
maintaining that people who are not actively looking for a job turn
out to be great employees.
But the Container Store's approach, alas, is a rare exception.
For most of America, customer service frequently remains an
oxymoron, though there are signs that some stores are paying more
attention to the problem. Staffs have been cut in the heat of
competitive battle, and sales clerks who remain are often less than
stellar _ since with joblessness down, good workers have
higher-paying options.
And while this is a year-round problem, it is especially acute
in the frenzied holiday season. At this time of year, hordes of
shoppers confront temporary sales clerks, who may be the least well
trained of all.
Judging from shoppers' stories, many encounters with sales
``help'' turn decidedly sour. When customers do have a good
experience, it must seem like a rarity, for they often feel
compelled to remark on it.
As gauged by a University of Michigan index, customer-service
satisfaction has dropped steadily the last few years. The rate of
satisfaction among the 200,000 shoppers interviewed remains far
below what it was in 1994, said Claes Fornell, a professor of
business administration who oversees the American Customer
Satisfaction Index. ``You have fewer people serving more
customers,'' he said, adding that he has had his own run-ins with
airlines and cable companies, ``and the result is usually worse
service.''
Some stores that have had cutbacks have little to offer workers
in terms of training or pay. Others have apparently failed to
anticipate what customers might need.
``I was at one store that had good service, to the point that
the guy kind of hovered around me,'' said Inna Hagen, an actress
and lawyer in New York City, ``but then they didn't have gift wrap,
which was annoying when you're shopping for Christmas presents.
They charged me $6 for a ribbon.
``I expect good service,'' she added, ``but I think you don't
get it a lot of the time.''
At the Container Store, ``We know we are just wild-eyed fanatics
when it comes to human resources and training,'' said Kip Tindell,
the chief operating officer, who founded the company with Boone 20
years ago. ``It is the most difficult and the most joyous part of
the retail business, and most people avoid it like the plague.''
The company says it makes a hefty profit, too, though it is
privately held and does not make such information public.
Service Intelligence, an Atlanta consulting firm that is hired
to place spies _ or ``mystery shoppers,'' as they prefer to call
them _ in stores to see how well managed everything is, has a Web
site (www.serviceintelligence.com) stocked with horror stories sent
in by consumers. Some of the most outrageous incidents occurred in
retail stores.
``While visiting a department store, I was amazed at how the
only sales clerk in the area was chatting on the telephone,'' a
consumer reported. (Neither shoppers nor stores are named on the
Web site.) ``I roamed around the department near the counter trying
to catch her attention. This didn't work. Finally, I approached the
counter and stood directly in front of her. She refused to make eye
contact and actually turned away from me. At this point, I stormed
out of the store, vowing never to return.''
Much of the deterioration is the result of price wars, which
prompted one executive after another to zero in on customer service
as an expendable luxury. ``It's been a huge mistake for many of
these retailers,'' said Leonard L. Berry, a professor at Texas A&AMP;M
University's Center for Retailing Studies, who is about to publish
a book, ``Discovering the Soul of Service,'' which examines
businesses that have effective customer service.

Many customers said they would often be satisfied with a little
basic information, such as having a sales clerk tell them fairly
quickly how soon they are likely to be waited on.
Some stores manage to maintain their islands of civility. At
Saks Fifth Avenue, sales clerks have been known to write thank-you
notes to shoppers after they make purchases _ even if the purchases
are less than spectacular. Nordstrom maintains a sterling
reputation for going out of its way to satisfy customers.
But those are the exceptions. In many cases, the nation's low
unemployment rate has propelled would-be retail workers into
higher-paying jobs elsewhere, leaving few options for stores that
are hiring. ``The big story this year is the employment crunch,''
said Bruce Van Kleeck, vice president of the National Retail
Federation. ``It's been challenging for three years, but this year
is by far the worst, because this terrific economic situation the
United States has been enjoying has been a double-edged sword for
retailers.''
That does not make shoppers any more sympathetic to sales
clerks. ``The great majority of them are either totally incompetent
or they need complete attitude adjustment because they think they
are better than the customer,'' said Anne Goldrach of New York
City, whose experiences made shopping on the Internet that much
more attractive this year.
Joy Johnson, a Brooklyn College student, has seen the issue from
both sides this month. As a part-time cashier at a Sears store in
New York City, she received four hours of training, which she says
she considered enough for that job. But as a shopper, she has not
always been treated kindly. After buying a set of glasses for her
mother at Macy's and discovering that one was broken, she brought
them back. ``He gave me a hard time,'' she said of the sales clerk,
who eventually agreed to exchange them. ``He said maybe I had
broken it. But I had had it only two days.'' Even so, Johnson rates
her shopping experience this year ``so far, so good.''
A spokeswoman for Macy's, part of Federated Stores, said the
clerk was probably trying to determine whether Johnson wanted a
refund or an exchange. ``We certainly do not train our associates
to tell our customers that they are not being trustworthy,'' said
the spokeswoman, Ronnie Taffet, adding that the main store at
Herald Square has been getting ``some very positive results'' in
its year-old effort to improve customer service.
Peter Gurney, a vice president of Service Intelligence's
research center in Seattle, blames the tight labor market for some
problems but says training is essential, no matter who is brought
aboard. And he thinks companies are starting to realize the need
for better customer service.
``There's a ground swell for bringing it back,'' he said, ``but
a controversy about what people should be doing. Companies can
absolutely differentiate themselves with it. But you can also spend
millions without getting any return.''
Fornell points out that replacing human workers with technology
has helped manufacturing and promoted growth. ``But if you take the
same idea and apply it to the service sector, which is so dependent
on human interaction, it is much more difficult to do,'' he said.
``It's not impossible. It is a question of education and of making
technology better.''
Knowing the products seems to be one of the biggest challenges.
Kurt Barnard, who publishes Barnard's Retail Trend Report, based in
Upper Montclair, N.J., cited an encounter he witnessed in a
suburban mall between a sales clerk and a shopper. ``The lady
wanted to buy one watch, a digital watch, which was $70 or $80,''
he said. ``The salesperson did not know how to set that watch. And
the salesperson did not know the difference between that watch and
another watch that was less expensive, that the customer also
liked.Third, the salesperson didn't know how to light the dial on
the watch. The customer got a little frustrated and said, `Can
anyone help me here?' The sales clerk said, `Let me call my
supervisor,' and then disappeared, never to return. Generally
speaking, this is not unusual.''
But companies that have decided to make sure employees
understand what they are selling say it is a worthwhile investment.
At Peet's Coffee, a chain based in Berkeley, Calif., employees are
taught the subtle differences between various types of coffee and
tea so they can explain them to customers. ``We teach them so that
they can discuss this intelligently,'' said Gerald Baldwin, the
company's founder. ``And our store volumes are much higher than
anyone else's. We like to think it's the way we treat the
customers.''
