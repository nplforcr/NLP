JERUSALEM (AP) _ Saying ``our rifle is ready,'' Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat hinted darkly at armed conflict Sunday,
prompting a sharp rebuke from Israel.
The escalation of rhetoric came as U.S. envoy Dennis Ross sought
to jump start implementation of the latest Mideast peace accord.
A senior adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
said Arafat's comments were a ``declaration of war on the peace
process.'' David Bar-Illan told The Associated Press that Netanyahu
``views such statements with the utmost severity,'' and would bring
them up when his Cabinet meets this week before Israel begins
withdrawing troops from the West Bank.
An Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the government had asked the United States, which mediated the
recent peace agreement, to condemn Arafat's comments.
