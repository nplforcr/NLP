ATLANTA, Oct. 29 -  
This has been the best year of Vijay Singh's career, and today he played one of 
the best rounds of his life. Shooting a brilliant seven-under-par 63 on a 
challenging East Lake Golf Club course where only nine players broke par, Singh 
soared to a three-stroke lead over Billy Mayfair after the first round of the 
Tour Championship. 

It was a machine-like display of ball-striking by Singh, this year's P.G.A. 
Champion, who missed only one fairway and putted with precision on 
lightning-fast greens that invited mistakes. Singh's round was the best 
competitive round in East Lake's history, and it also matched the lowest round 
in Tour Championship history, equaled by Wayne Levi in 1989 and Jim Gallagher 
Jr. in 1993. 

Tommy Barnes holds the course record (62) at East Lake, but the legendary Bobby 
Jones, who learned to play golf at East Lake, never shot better than a 63 on his 
home course. 

Regardless of what club Singh held in his hands today, he felt confident of 
hitting a good shot. Singh made it look easy. But it wasn't. 

''Unbelievable,'' said Singh, whose round included eight birdies and one bogey as 
he avoided the treacherous Bermuda rough. ''I hit the ball probably the best I 
did all year. I drove the ball really long and straight. The longest iron I hit 
today was a 6-iron. 

''Today was an exceptional round for anybody to shoot 63 around here. I think the 
longest putt I had was 18 feet. It's one of the best rounds I've ever had from 
tee to green.'' 

Nobody could keep pace with Singh today, but with three rounds remaining on a 
course this difficult, most players in the elite 30-man field remained within 
striking distance. Mayfair's 66 left him alone in second place, while Tom Lehman 
and Jim Furyk (67) were tied for third place. 

Meanwhile, the competition for the money title and PGA Tour player of the year 
honors could get interesting before the weekend ends. David Duval can clinch the 
money title simply by finishing alone in 24th place or better. But Duval 
struggled to a 75 today, leaving him tied for 28th place with Tiger Woods. 

If Duval finishes lower than 24th, and if Furyk wins the tournament, Furyk can 
snatch the money title from Duval. And Duval is battling Mark O'Meara for player 
of the year honors, but O'Meara did not have a sparkling round today either, 
shooting a one-over-par 71. 

The scores of Duval and Woods, neither of whom had a birdie, showed how 
difficult East Lake is, but Singh was almost too good to notice. He shot a 
five-under-par 30 on the front nine, using his accuracy to set up makeable 
birdie putts. At No. 1, Singh hit a 9-iron approach shot to within six feet of 
the cup. At No. 3, he hit a sand wedge to within a foot. At No. 5, he hit 
another 9-iron to eight feet. At No. 8, he hit a pitching wedge to a foot. Singh 
made all of those ensuing short putts for birdie, then at No. 9, he made an 
18-foot birdie putt, just in case anyone felt that he could not make a long one. 


Singh's momentum continued on the back nine. He birdied No. 11, hitting a 7-iron 
approach shot to six feet, then making the putt. On No. 13, his birdie was set 
up by a sand wedge approach shot that stopped a foot from the hole. Then Singh 
reached eight under par when he birdied the par-5 No. 15, reaching the green in 
two shots, then two-putting from 25 feet. 

The only blemish on Singh's card came at the par-3 No. 18, when he bogeyed by 
three-putting from 40 feet. But it did not spoil his day, or his year. 

Despite all the talk about Duval and O'Meara, Singh is third on the money list, 
and he has won two tournaments (the P.G.A. Championship and Sprint 
International). If Singh were to take home the $720,000 first-place check, he 
would finish No. 2 on the money list, and he would have more victories on tour 
this year than anyone except Duval (four). 

Singh entered this week somewhat overshadowed, but he was not after today. Most 
of Singh's gallery came to see Woods, Singh's playing partner. But while people 
may have arrived talking about Woods, they left talking about Singh. 

''My whole game is getting better,'' said Singh, a 35-year-old native of Fiji, who 
lives in Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla. ''But I was never expecting to shoot anything 
like that. I just said, 'Make sure you play solid, shoot a good number, don't 
shoot yourself out.' It turned out really good for me.''
