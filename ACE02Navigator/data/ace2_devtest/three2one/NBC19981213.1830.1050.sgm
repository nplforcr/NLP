in "focus" this evening, one community's conflict between free speech and
free enterprise.
nbc's kelly o'donnell has our report.

<ANNOTATION> Reporter: </ANNOTATION>
as workmen struggle to ready the city of pasadena for the tournament of
roses -- assembling parade stands, sprucing crosswalks -- a struggle
involving commerce and constitutional rights has landed in the laps of city
officials.
<TURN>
we're here to teach and educate everyone.
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> Reporter: </ANNOTATION>
the battle centers around members of a religious group and what their
sidewalk sermons are doing to local businesses.
<TURN>
that's what you're doing is killing the base here.
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> Reporter: </ANNOTATION>
here is old pasadena, a 20-block-long haven for shoppers -- everything from
national chain retailers to restaurants to movie theaters, and store owners
like sharon arthofer.
she says her pretzel business is off 20% on those sundays when the
religious group shows up.
<TURN>
they need to find a location and preach their message, and people who want
to come listen to them listen to them.
but it doesn't have to be shared in the middle of old pasadena.
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> Reporter: </ANNOTATION>
city officials say they are sympathetic, but that the preachers aren't
breaking any laws.
<TURN>
we've have had meetings and discussed what they're doing, but as far as we
were concerned, from a prosecution, law enforcement standpoint, what they
were doing was well within their constitutional rights.
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> Reporter: </ANNOTATION>
members of the israeli church of universal practical knowledge are based in
this storefront in inglewood, some 25 miles from pasadena.
gregory hamilton, who prefers the title priest zayan ahla, is the group's
leader.
<TURN>
we have a right to be on the sidewalks as long as we're not violating any
laws.
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> Reporter: </ANNOTATION>
the city of pasadena has charged priest ahla with disturbing the peace,
after an incident with one store employee.
in an effort to end the standoff, some new laws are under consideration,
including an ordinance allowing groups a specific number of street
meetings, while charging for any additional gatherings.
members of pasadena's human relations committee now sometimes monitor the
street preachers in an effort to defuse tensions.
<TURN>
we're not trying to take away the freedom of speech, but freedom of speech
has to be weighed with the right of commerce for the business people.
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> Reporter: </ANNOTATION>
some members of the city's religious community believe tolerance should be
shown.
<TURN>
preaching on the street corner some people find annoying and obnoxious, but
they are pursuing their own freedom of religion.
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> Reporter: </ANNOTATION>
but, so far, attempts to mediate this dispute have failed, and both sides
seem to be digging in.
<TURN>
i don't think it's fair to the people that initially built pasadena and
those of us who have invested in pasadena.
<TURN>
to tell you the truth, it really has nothing to do with us.
it has to do with what we're teaching and what we represent.
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> Reporter: </ANNOTATION>
no matter what obstacles come their way, be it new city laws or open
hostility, the members of the church say they plan to return here to spread
their word.
