HEADLINE:  Control of Domain Names Draws Alternative Proposal

WASHINGTON, OCT. 4 -  
The Clinton Administration this week enters the final phase of what has been a 
highly contentious effort by the Government to hand administration of the 
Internet over to an international nonprofit corporation. 

A group led by Jon Postel, a founder of the Internet, presented the Government 
on Friday with its proposal for creating a California-based entity called the 
Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers. ''This organization will be 
unique in the world -- a nongovernmental organization with significant 
responsibilities for administering what is becoming an important global 
resource,'' Mr. Postel wrote. 

The larger significance of the proposal is that it lays out the final 
privatization of the Internet by the Federal Government, which financed decades 
of Internet development as a communication tool for military and academic 
researchers. 

The more immediate issue is forming an equitable plan for creating and 
distributing ''top-level domain names,'' the identifiers like .com and .org that 
identify what type of resource an Internet address is. The .com top-level 
domain, for example, signifies a commercial address. 

Until now, domain names have been administered by the United States Government 
-- at first directly and in more recent years under a Government contract 
granting a registration monopoly to Network Solutions, a corporation based in 
Herndon, Va. 
A number of private companies have demanded that they be allowed to compete with 
Network Solutions in the lucrative business of registering domain names, while 
Europeans and Asian have complained that their interests are underrepresented in 
the development and administration of domain names. 

The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, which is newly 
incorporated, nominated nine interim board members to help finish writing bylaws 
and create a permanent 19-member board responsible for introducing competition 
and a recognition of international interests to the domain registration system. 
Under the proposal, the corporation would also make decisions on how and when to 
add new top-level domains. 

But the long-awaited revamping plan by Mr. Postel's group still has a number of 
critics, and the Clinton Administration has not yet ironed out the details for a 
smooth transition of crucial property and customer records from Network 
Solutions to the new corporation. 

Ira Magaziner, the adviser to President Clinton who has been overseeing the 
transition to private governance of the Internet, had hoped to have a plan in 
place by the time the Government's contract with Network Solutions expired on 
Oct. 1. But a last-minute breakdown in negotiations prompted the Commerce 
Department to extend the old contract for one week. It is now set to expire on 
Wednesday. 

Another extension is likely, since the Government will take 10 days of public 
comments on the plan and two proposed variations before it moves forward. Many 
critics say the Postel plan was hammered out behind closed doors, despite the 
Administration's call for a process that strove for consensus among the 
international groups that have an interest in how the network is governed. 

One contention about the Postel plan concerns whether the new agreement would 
unfairly strip Network Solutions of the lucrative business it has built as the 
monopoly registrar of top-level domains. Company spokesmen declined comment 
beyond saying negotiations with the Government were continuing. 

A larger issue about the plan, though, is whether there would be proper fiscal 
controls and long-term checks on the powers of the proposed new board, whose 
members would be largely appointed by the professional, advocacy and commercial 
organizations that finance the corporation. 

''The substantive problem with it is that it is completely obtuse to questions of 
separation of powers and limits and accountability,'' said Lawrence Lessig, a 
Harvard Law School professor who has been critical of what he sees as a 
secretive process for drafting the proposal. 

''It's a perfect corporation if you trusted the board members,'' Mr. Lessig said, 
''just like any Communist government is perfect if you trust the Communist 
government.'' 

An international coalition of associations representing a range of Internet 
interests has filed its own bylaw proposals, which would make the corporation a 
membership-based organization rather than one whose board members are largely 
selected by the organizations that finance it. 

In another objection, J. William Semich, president and chief financial officer 
of .NU Domain, a registrar of second-level domain names, said that the proposed 
bylaws lacked the proper budget reviews and spending limits. 

In his letter to William Daley, the Secretary of Commerce, Mr. Postel 
acknowledged the continuing opposition to his plan. He said that while the 
organization had been formally incorporated, it had not yet elected a board or 
adopted bylaws and did not plan to do so until the completion of a Commerce 
Department review of the proposal. 

''There are many challenges left for the days and years to come, but the 
consensus that developed around these documents provides considerable promise 
that those challenges can also be overcome,'' he wrote. 

The proposed interim board includes representatives of telecommunications, 
Internet and academic interests from the United States, Japan, Australia and 
Europe.
