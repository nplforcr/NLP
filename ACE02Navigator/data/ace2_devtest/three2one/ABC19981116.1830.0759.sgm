Now our regular report on how the government sometimes misuses your money.
Historically, black colleges have received federal funding to further their
mission of educating young black Americans.
So, what happens when a black college is no longer black?
Here's ABC's Michelle Norris.

<ANNOTATION> Reporter: </ANNOTATION>
This is bluefield state college, one of the nation's 105
historically black colleges -- or is it?
<TURN>
When I go to class, I'm the only black and female in the class.
<TURN>
Till I came here, I didn't even know it was an historically black college.
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> Reporter: </ANNOTATION>
At bluefield it's not just a problem of appearance.
Historically, black colleges automatically qualify for federal funds that
are meant to help needy black students.
That was once the mission at bluefield state, but times have changed.
Today there are few visible signs that the school once served an all-black
population.
And yet the school continues to receive more than $1 million a year in
federal funding earmarked for black institutions of higher learning, even
though the school is now 93% white.
Of the school's 2,300 students, about 200 are African-American.
<TURN>
If you look around, there's not a lot of blacks, there's not a lot of black
staff.
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> Reporter: </ANNOTATION>
In fact, only 2 of the school's 80 faculty members are black.
<TURN>
And how do we define culture?
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> Reporter: </ANNOTATION>
And both were hired just this fall.
One professor has sued bluefield state for collecting millions of dollars
of your money, even though the school is a black college in name only.
<TURN>
Maybe legally they do, but, you know, I don't think morally they have a
Right to those funds.
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> Reporter: </ANNOTATION>
Even the federal government admits there is a problem.
<TURN>
There is a legitimate and serious question about whether they deserve to
continue to receive that funding.
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> Reporter: </ANNOTATION>
But that hasn't stopped the government from doling out handouts
and it hasn't stopped the school from accepting the cash.
There's a limited pool of money.
<TURN>
yes.
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> Reporter: </ANNOTATION>
So if you're getting $1 million, that's $1 million that someone
else is not getting.
<TURN>
But I'm not making that decision on the thing.
I'm just putting through the proposal.
As an institution, we seek out those things that we are eligible for.
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> Reporter: </ANNOTATION>
Whether or not the school remains eligible is a question that
only Congress can resolve.
But until that happens, this historically black, yet predominantly white
college, will continue collecting $1 million of your money each year.
