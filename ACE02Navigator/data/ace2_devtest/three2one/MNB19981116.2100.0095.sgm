First, however, the fallout on the attack that never came after gearing up
U.S. forces, they were given the final sta-down order for you.
And for now, we'll begin with Claire Shipman.
<TURN>
Humanitarian relief workers head back to Baghdad.
Tomorrow, U.N. inspectors will follow.
Saddam Hussein pro claims victory to his revolutionary council.
A familiar scenario, but President Clinton insisted again today this time
is different.
<TURN>
The world is watching Saddam Hussein to see the he follows the words he
uttered with deeds.
Our forces remain strong and ready if he does not.
<TURN>
A threat reinforced by the secretary of defense.
<TURN>
I think he has had more than sufficient warning.
I don't believe that any additional warning is required.
<TURN>
And America's staunchest Ally.
<TURN>
The next withdrawal of cooperation, and he will be hit.
<TURN>
But the question remains -- how can the U.S. and if U.N. inspectors
effectively ghand and measure Iraqi compliance?
Sources tell NBC the inspectors will look for the following early signs --
full cooperation with spot nppingtses of new sites, documents detailing
current and past weapons stocks, one dealing with chemical weapons was
discovered by inspectors but immediately taken back by the iraqs.
<TURN>
We need documents.
If they can provide us documents, that will be an indication they are
serious about cooperating.
<TURN>
And the United Nations would also like an accurate accounting of chemical
and biological stocks, which, the proven inaccurate, could ten be grounds
for punishment.
But the real fear here tonight, of course, is that once again, Iraqi
cooperation will prove superficial, bringing no new answers yet making
military action more difficult.
Claire Shipman, NBC news, the White House.
