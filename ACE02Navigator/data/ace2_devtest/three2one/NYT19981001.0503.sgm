The marketers of Chanel No. 5 will again ask consumers to
``Share the fantasy,'' with a lavish spot that tries to make a sale
with a fairy tale.
The extravagant, elaborate spot, based on ``Little Red Riding
Hood,'' will run initially in the United States, to be shown on
Monday on MTV _ the first time a commercial for Chanel No. 5 has
appeared on that youth-oriented cable television network. The
pitch-cum-fable will be supplemented by advertising in magazines
and in stores that sell Chanel No. 5, and then be introduced in
slightly different versions in Europe.
The commercial was conceived by Luc Besson, the French director
of films like ``The Fifth Element'' and ``La Femme Nikita,'' with
creative contributions from Jacques Helleu, artistic director at
the Chanel couture house in Paris. It features the model Estella
Warren as a grown-up Little Red in a riding hood that Karl
Lagerfeld, the designer of Chanel apparel, created for the
commercial.
The spot, which updates ``Little Red Riding Hood'' by adding
splashes of sophistication and sex, marks a return to the
larger-than-life, surrealistic style of advertising that was
emblematic of the No. 5 fragrance from 1979 through the early
1990s, most notably in Dali-esque commercials directed by Ridley
Scott.
``In a tough world where there are a lot of problems, fantasy is
healthy,'' said Arie Kopelman, president and chief operating
officer of Chanel Inc. in New York, the U.S. unit of Chanel.
The commercial also exemplifies the ambitious efforts by
marketers of venerable brands to keep them fresh as competition
intensifies in categories like fashion that are particularly
vulnerable to the whims of fickle consumers.
The goal is to ``keep an old brand healthy and young,'' Kopelman
said. ``You have to reach out and bring in new users.''
One way to accomplish that is to continually remake campaigns.
For Chanel No. 5, which was introduced in 1921, Chanel has changed
commercials five times in the last 19 years, presenting spiels
centered on such elements as imaginary pools and gardens, Marilyn
Monroe and the art of Andy Warhol.
``For a brand that's over 75 years old, it's hard to convey
modernity,'' said Laurie Palma, vice president for fragrance
marketing at Chanel Inc. ``Advertising helps us keep the brand
modern, not just classic.''
And this time, though the commercial is imbued with many fantasy
elements, there is a harder-selling orientation as evinced by the
appearance of the number five every few moments along with a giant
wall of glowing No. 5 bottles.
``The commercial is a fairy tale for big kids, focused on Chanel
No. 5 in a way we think takes everything we've ever done creatively
full circle,'' Kopelman said.
The spot starts with music from the film ``Edward Scissorhands''
and a shot of Ms. Warren treading a footbridge to an armored door
marked with the ``5'' from the No. 5 logo. She gains entry with an
access code _ yes, 5. Taking a bottle from the wall, she proceeds
to the exit. The Eiffel Tower amid cinematic snow reveals the
setting to be Paris.
``We looked at not having a French element,'' Kopelman said,
``but it's key to remind people that this product, the first
designer fragrance, is after all French.''
Suddenly a black wolf emerges, ready to pounce. But beauty
prevails over the beast, defusing the attack with a tender shush.
As Ms. Warren departs, the wolf howls and the camera pulls back to
show an oversized ``5'' on the floor, which then becomes a bottle
of Chanel No. 5.
The American version of the spot ends with an announcer urging
viewers to ``Share the fantasy.'' The European version omit those
final words and runs longer than the 30-second American version.
The spot will make its debut on MTV as part of the plans to
reach ``a younger audience,'' Ms. Palma said, ``which at one point
was 40-plus but is now 30-plus or even younger.''
``One thing we've learned,'' she added, ``is that young people
increasingly talk about escaping from reality and the stress in the
world.''

Lyle Saunders, vice president for creative services at Chanel
Inc., noted the popularity of extreme sports and computer games
with that demographic group as proof of their burgeoning interest
in fantasy.
In early November, the spot will be shown on two other cable
networks watched by younger consumers, VH1 and E Entertainment
Television. A month later, it will begin on broadcast TV stations
in 38 big markets around the United States.
Chanel Inc. intends to spend more than $3.2 million to advertise
Chanel No. 5 on television in the fourth quarter, Kopelman said,
compared with almost $1.3 million in the corresponding period a
year ago.
The magazine ads will run in titles including Elle, Harper's
Bazaar, Los Angeles, The New Yorker and Vogue. The in-store
advertising will take place at such chains as Bloomingdale's, Lord
&AMP; Taylor, Macy's, Nordstrom, Robinsons-May and Saks Fifth Avenue.
Plans call for the commercial to appear in France on Oct. 16 and
then expand to Germany, Italy and Spain in early December.
And if a red-hooded blonde, a wall of perfume bottles and a
howling wolf are not sufficient to stimulate additional sales for
Chanel No. 5, there is a packaging innovation, too: For the first
time, an eau de parfum spray will be sold in the brand's classic
beveled bottle.
