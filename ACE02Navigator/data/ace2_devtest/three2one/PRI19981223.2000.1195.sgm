This is The World. I'm Lisa Mullins. When a church choir sang "Jingle
Bells," "Silent Night" and the "Hallelujah Chorus" of Handel's "Messiah"
this week on the steps of a cathedral, a crowd of several hundred listened
in rapt attention. But the appeal was based less on nostalgia than novelty.
The performance was in Havana, and it was the first of its kind in Cuba
since Christmas was abolished there in 1970. Last year, president Fidel
Castro granted a Christmas holiday as a one-time favor to Pope John Paul II
before his January visit. Last month, the government decided to make the
holiday permanent. The World's Maria Zareyes tells us about a Cuban
Christmas in Havana.

Sunday Mass is well attended at this church in Havana, particularly as
Catholics here prepared for the upcoming Christmas celebration. The priest
at this parish, Father Jose Fernandez, says he's pleased with the recent
announcements by the Cuban government to reinstate the celebration of
Christmas after three decades of suspension.

I think we'll all enjoy this time of celebration. It's a victory for the
people of faith. We're also happy because the Cuban people in general will
be able to celebrate Christmas, Catholics and non-Catholics alike. I can
tell you that in the past five years, more people have been coming to
Midnight Mass on Christmas Eve. We hope that this year even more people
will come to the church tomorrow.

In the last few weeks, Father Jose Fernandez has been using his sermons to
remind people of the religious meaning of Christmas Day. His church, like
many other churches across the island, have distributed a series of
leaflets explaining the concept of Christmas in very simple terms.

I think by now, most Cubans know that Christmas is the time to celebrate
the birth of Jesus. I believe they also know that the Christmas tree is a
symbol of life, just as Jesus is also life for us Christians.

The celebration of Christmas in Cuba was never explicitly banned by the
Cuban government. But in 1970, the authorities converted Christmas Day,
December 25, from a holiday to a normal working day. Soon, Christmas was
forgotten -- but not by everyone. Nancy is a middle-aged Havana resident
who doesn't want to give her full name. While shopping for ornaments for
this year's tree, she says that Christmas has always been important for her
family.

We have always celebrated Christmas. We have done it with what we've had at
the time. We've eaten what's been available. Those who wanted to maintain
the tradition have done it.

At this shopping center in Havana, only one store sells Christmas trees and
a limited variety of ornaments and decorations. A medium-sized tree can
cost between $60 and $80. The smaller ones are more affordable, but the few
available are all gone by now. Nancy recalls the times when none of the
things were available.

Now we have these things, but before, you couldn't buy them because they
weren't available. As a Christmas tree, we used a dried branch. We painted
it and then decorated it with small boxes wrapped with colored paper. We
also used empty cans painted with different colors to put on the tree. Now
the state shops are selling these things to those who can afford them, of
course, because they're mainly priced in dollars. And as you know, not many
people here can afford dollars.

As the Cubans prepare to celebrate Christmas, buying decorations and the
traditional leg of pork to roast, the Catholic Church is taking the
opportunity to spread its message that Christmas should be a religious and
spiritual celebration and not a commercial feast. For The World, I'm Maria
Zareyes in Havana.
