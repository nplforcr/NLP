chartering a plane for a business trip may sound extravagant . in some cases , it can be the best deal . dan ronan explains in this edition of `` working ahead . '' reporter : microtel chairman mike leven is going to work . today he 's headed to georgetown , kentucky , to oversee the grand opening of the franchise company 's 100th hotel . okay . all right . yeah . applause reporter : leven is based in atlanta . georgetown has an airport . but there 's no scheduled commercial jet service . the solution , charter a plane to fly him and his staff in for the day . commercial does n't go to some of the places we have to go . if it -- if commercial does go , sometimes the schedule does n't work . often times now it 's very close to the same price if you 're taking a lot of people because commercial fares have gone up for business travelers so much . reporter : the cost of flying this charter plane is about $ 3,000 a day . if you were to fly all of the passengers on a commercial jet in first class , it would be a little less . still , if you pay for the charter with a charge card , you 'd accumulate frequent-flier miles . there are nearly 700 airports in the u.s. that can handle commercial jets . but there are nearly 5,500 smaller facilities for general aviation . more companies are finding that , with crowded airports and tight schedules , flying on a charter makes economic sense and improves morale . it 's not an extravagance , it 's as a necessity of business today . and in fact , 84 % of the people who fly on corporate jets are not the top management . they 're engineering teams , they 're people who are traveling in order to get to a factory or something like that . reporter : leven and his team would spend about two hours in kentucky , meeting with hotel investors , employees and residents . the time in the air makes them more efficient . generally , i will take two , three or four people with me on one of these trips . we usually hold a meeting on the plane . it 's a casual , more relaxed atmosphere . you certainly ca n't do that on a commercial airline . so you are using the time that you 're in the air to conduct business . reporter : but this ceo flies regular commercial flights when that is more cost-effective , as he did this day , catching a flight from cincinnati to boston . dan ronan , cnn , cincinnati , ohio .
