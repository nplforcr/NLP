president clinton was in new york friday to give democratic congressman charles schumer a last-minute campaign boost . schumer is challenging incumbent republican senator alfonse d'amato in a heavily-watched contest . the president urged americans to vote , saying democrats like schumer may mean the difference in whether the government can save social security . the latest polls show schumer has a slight lead in a race that has turned increasingly bitter . friday , vice president gore lashed out at house speaker newt gingrich , accusing him of orchestrating a $ 10 million ad campaign to exploit the monica lewinsky issue . personal , partisan attacks aimed at the president of the united states , written and devised by speaker gingrich just a few days before the election , is just a smokescreen to avoid discussion of the real issues . and i think the american people have served notice that they do n't like that kind of approach , and i think you 'll see a reaction .
