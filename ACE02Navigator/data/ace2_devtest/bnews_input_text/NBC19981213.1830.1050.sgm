in `` focus '' this evening , one community 's conflict between free speech and free enterprise . nbc 's kelly o ` donnell has our report . reporter : as workmen struggle to ready the city of pasadena for the tournament of roses -- assembling parade stands , sprucing crosswalks -- a struggle involving commerce and constitutional rights has landed in the laps of city officials . we 're here to teach and educate everyone . reporter : the battle centers around members of a religious group and what their sidewalk sermons are doing to local businesses . that 's what you 're doing is killing the base here . reporter : here is old pasadena , a 20-block-long haven for shoppers -- everything from national chain retailers to restaurants to movie theaters , and store owners like sharon arthofer . she says her pretzel business is off 20 % on those sundays when the religious group shows up . they need to find a location and preach their message , and people who want to come listen to them listen to them . but it does n't have to be shared in the middle of old pasadena . reporter : city officials say they are sympathetic , but that the preachers are n't breaking any laws . we 've have had meetings and discussed what they 're doing , but as far as we were concerned , from a prosecution , law enforcement standpoint , what they were doing was well within their constitutional rights . reporter : members of the israeli church of universal practical knowledge are based in this storefront in inglewood , some 25 miles from pasadena . gregory hamilton , who prefers the title priest zayan ahla , is the group 's leader . we have a right to be on the sidewalks as long as we 're not violating any laws . reporter : the city of pasadena has charged priest ahla with disturbing the peace , after an incident with one store employee . in an effort to end the standoff , some new laws are under consideration , including an ordinance allowing groups a specific number of street meetings , while charging for any additional gatherings . members of pasadena 's human relations committee now sometimes monitor the street preachers in an effort to defuse tensions . we 're not trying to take away the freedom of speech , but freedom of speech has to be weighed with the right of commerce for the business people . reporter : some members of the city 's religious community believe tolerance should be shown . preaching on the street corner some people find annoying and obnoxious , but they are pursuing their own freedom of religion . reporter : but , so far , attempts to mediate this dispute have failed , and both sides seem to be digging in . i do n't think it 's fair to the people that initially built pasadena and those of us who have invested in pasadena . to tell you the truth , it really has nothing to do with us . it has to do with what we 're teaching and what we represent . reporter : no matter what obstacles come their way , be it new city laws or open hostility , the members of the church say they plan to return here to spread their word . kelly o ` donnell , nbc news , pasadena .
