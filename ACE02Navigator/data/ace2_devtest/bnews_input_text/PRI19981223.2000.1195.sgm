spkr : mullins this is the world . i 'm lisa mullins . when a church choir sang `` jingle bells , '' `` silent night '' and the `` hallelujah chorus '' of handel 's `` messiah '' this week on the steps of a cathedral , a crowd of several hundred listened in rapt attention . but the appeal was based less on nostalgia than novelty . the performance was in havana , and it was the first of its kind in cuba since christmas was abolished there in 1970 . last year , president fidel castro granted a christmas holiday as a one-time favor to pope john paul ii before his january visit . last month , the government decided to make the holiday permanent . the world 's maria zareyes tells us about a cuban christmas in havana . spkr : maria_zareyes sunday mass is well attended at this church in havana , particularly as catholics here prepared for the upcoming christmas celebration . the priest at this parish , father jose fernandez , says he 's pleased with the recent announcements by the cuban government to reinstate the celebration of christmas after three decades of suspension . spkr : father_jose_fernandez i think we 'll all enjoy this time of celebration . it 's a victory for the people of faith . we 're also happy because the cuban people in general will be able to celebrate christmas , catholics and non-catholics alike . i can tell you that in the past five years , more people have been coming to midnight mass on christmas eve . we hope that this year even more people will come to the church tomorrow . spkr : zareyes in the last few weeks , father jose fernandez has been using his sermons to remind people of the religious meaning of christmas day . his church , like many other churches across the island , have distributed a series of leaflets explaining the concept of christmas in very simple terms . spkr : father_fernandez i think by now , most cubans know that christmas is the time to celebrate the birth of jesus . i believe they also know that the christmas tree is a symbol of life , just as jesus is also life for us christians . spkr : zareyes the celebration of christmas in cuba was never explicitly banned by the cuban government . but in 1970 , the authorities converted christmas day , december 25 , from a holiday to a normal working day . soon , christmas was forgotten -- but not by everyone . nancy is a middle-aged havana resident who does n't want to give her full name . while shopping for ornaments for this year 's tree , she says that christmas has always been important for her family . spkr : nancy we have always celebrated christmas . we have done it with what we 've had at the time . we 've eaten what 's been available . those who wanted to maintain the tradition have done it . spkr : zareyes at this shopping center in havana , only one store sells christmas trees and a limited variety of ornaments and decorations . a medium-sized tree can cost between $ 60 and $ 80 . the smaller ones are more affordable , but the few available are all gone by now . nancy recalls the times when none of the things were available . spkr : nancy now we have these things , but before , you could n't buy them because they were n't available . as a christmas tree , we used a dried branch . we painted it and then decorated it with small boxes wrapped with colored paper . we also used empty cans painted with different colors to put on the tree . now the state shops are selling these things to those who can afford them , of course , because they 're mainly priced in dollars . and as you know , not many people here can afford dollars . spkr : zareyes as the cubans prepare to celebrate christmas , buying decorations and the traditional leg of pork to roast , the catholic church is taking the opportunity to spread its message that christmas should be a religious and spiritual celebration and not a commercial feast . for the world , i 'm maria zareyes in havana .
