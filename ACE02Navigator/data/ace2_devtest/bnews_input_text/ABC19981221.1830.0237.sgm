in the political tempest that has been the impeachment process , there are several careers that have been changed forever . one of those belongs to dennis hastert of illinois . come january he 'll have one of the most powerful jobs in the u.s. government when he 's the new speaker of the house . dennis hastert , who will soon be 57 , was a high school teacher and a wrestling coach before he was a politician . speaker gingrich , myself and many other members of congress -- reporter : he represents the largely republican suburbs west of chicago . he was a state legislator before he ran for congress in 1986 . he is described as a conservative , but not an ideologue . there 's a big role to play . we need to heal the wounds and we need to reach out across the aisle . reporter : hastert has risen quite high in republican ranks while keeping a fairly low profile . i did n't really seek this at all . it just kind of happened . reporter : so far , at least , a man without obvious enemies .
