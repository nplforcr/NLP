keith : finally tonight , it 's `` the news without . '' two brief sports stories . we 've learned that free agent first baseman mo vaughn has told friends and family he will re-sign with the boston red sox unless the anaheim angels agree to bid against themselves and raise an offer that 's already higher than the offer vaughn has gotten from boston . if that does not make sense , this reminder that vaughn is from new england and previously said he would accept slightly less to stay with the old town team . how much is slightly less and how much is too less ? anaheim has reportedly offered vaughn $ 72 million over six seasons . the associated press reports the red sox have countered at a figure lower than that . we learned it 's apparently close enough that vaughn will take it unless the angels want to go higher still .
