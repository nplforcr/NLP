We'll hear how the impeachment drama is playing overseas in a few minutes,
but our top story today is the crisis in Kosovo where ethnic Albanian
guerrillas have been fighting for independence from Serbia. Today, the
Kosovo Liberation Army declared a unilateral cease fire in its seven-month
battle with Serbian forces. Also today, President Clinton stood by his
promise that the United States will vote to authorize military strikes
against Serbia if its leader, Slobodan Milosevic, fails to withdraw from
Kosovo. We have reports from Belgrade where Milosevic is holding firm, from
London, where six major powers are meeting on the crisis. And leading off
our coverage, from NATO headquarters in Brussels where the world's Margaret
Evans heard some tough talk from the United States.

The pressure on Slobodan Milosevic to end his crackdown in Kosovo has
reached its highest level yet. After talks at NATO headquarters, Madeleine
Albright warned Milosevic that if he doesn't withdraw his ground forces
from Kosovo and stop aggression against the province's majority ethnic
Albanian population, he'll face air strikes in a matter of days. NATO
ambassadors approved the operational plan for strikes, and for the first
time, American officials released details of their expected contribution.
Some 260 NATO aircraft are expected to take part with up to 60 percent of
them coming from the United States. U.S. fighter planes, bombers, and
cruise missiles would be launched from aircraft carriers in the Adriatic
and bases in Germany and Italy. The attacks would involve bombings of
increasing intensity at targets deeper and deeper inside Yugoslav
territory. Albright also decided to send U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke back
to Belgrade to deliver NATO's message in person, but that decision has also
created some confusion. Holbrooke has already been rebuffed by Milosevic at
three previous meetings. Some NATO officials say that should have been
enough to trigger action. It's the issue that's plagued diplomats here all
week long as meetings expected to authorize air strikes have been called
and canceled several times over. For THE WORLD, I'm Margaret Evans in
Brussels.
