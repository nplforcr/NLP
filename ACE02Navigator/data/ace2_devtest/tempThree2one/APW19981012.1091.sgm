BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ As NATO stood poised to approve
airstrikes, a top U.S. envoy left marathon talks with Slobodan
Milosevic on Monday to brief the alliance amid reports a
breakthrough was near to avert airstrikes over Kosovo.
Richard Holbrooke's mission to Brussels, Belgium, came with
Western nations evacuating diplomats from Yugoslavia _ adding to a
sense that a last-minute deal was necessary to avoid intervention.
Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev told journalists in
Moscow that the Yugoslav president had agreed to allow 1,500
international observers to monitor compliance with U.N. demands to
halt the Serb crackdown in Kosovo.
If true, that would represent a key last-minute concession by
Milosevic that came only hours before NATO planned to authorize the
attack against Milosevic's forces.
There was no immediate confirmation of Milosevic's reported
concession. But a statement from Milosevic's office said Holbrooke
would return and hold more talks Tuesday.
It said Milosevic ``has concluded that undoubtedly, necessary
conditions exist for a peaceful political solution to the Kosovo
problem'' _ a position that Western officials previously have
disputed.
In the Kosovo capital Pristina, a senior ethnic Albanian leader
said that if Milosevic agrees to such a force, it ``could prove
useful and provide a way out of the Kosovo crisis without further
war.''
``If Milosevic really accepts an international monitoring force,
it would create a position of equilibrium in which the two sides
can then negotiate,'' said Fehmi Agani, head of the ethnic Albanian
team set up to negotiate with Belgrade authorities.
Milosevic launched his crackdown Feb. 28 to crush the Kosovo
Liberation Army, fighting for independence for the majority
Albanian province, which is part of Serbia, a Yugoslav republic.
The confluct has killed hundreds of driven more than 270,000
people from their homes.
In Kosovo, the ethnic Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center
said two ethnic Albanians were wounded Monday when ``newly-arrived
Serb forces shot at a village'' in central Drenica region.
The center also reported shooting near Malisevo, 40 kilometers
(25 miles) southwest of Pristina, and army troops deployment of 40
vehicles near Podujevo, 25 kilometers (16 miles) north of the
provincial capital.
Serb sources claimed there were no clashes Monday in the
province. None of the reports could be independently confirmed.
Ethnic Albanians represent 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million people
and most want independence or self-rule.
Holbrooke arrived in Brussels as NATO ambassadors were meeting
to approve an activation order _ the last formal step before
airstrikes could be launched.
A NATO official who spoke on condition of anonymity said an
activation order would show NATO's resolve to end the violence in
Kosovo, where hundreds of people have been killed and tens of
thousands uprooted since Feb. 28 crackdown against ethnic Albanian
rebels started.
The order would transfer the command over the airplanes and
military equipment necessary for an airstrike to Supreme Allied
Commander Wesley K. Clark and authorize its deployment over
Yugoslavia.
Clark could then proceed in consultation with NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana all the way to actually ordering
planes and missiles launched.
Sergeyev said Russia, which as Yugoslavia's ally has tried to
broker a deal that would avoid NATO intervention, was prepared to
provide planes for controlling Yugoslav airspace, and consider
participating in the monitoring force.
Earlier Monday, United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan
phoned Milosevic to urge him to comply with U.N. resolutions to end
the Kosovo turmoil.
Milosevic responded that he was ``in the process of complying,
or trying to come into full compliance with the Security Council
resolutions,'' spokesman Fred Eckhard said.
Holbrooke's mission to Brussels followed a flurry of diplomatic
evacuations by Western nations from Yugoslavia. That added to a
sense that intervention was imminent _ barring a breakthrough in
negotiations.
The international diplomats' mission observing events evacuated
Kosovo for neighboring Macedonia, with the Russian members the last
to depart. Sources at the American Embassy in Belgrade said all but
12 foreign staff were being evacuated to Budapest, and an embassy
statement said personnel in ``non-emergency situations'' had left.
A State Department advisory urged all U.S. citizens to leave
Yugoslavia, and Americans in the Serb part of neighboring Bosnia
also were advised to leave. The German, British, Danish and other
foreign embassies closed down Monday.
Holbrooke, who has met with Milosevic seven times in the past
eight days for a total of roughly 50 hours, described his earlier
overnight meeting with Milosevic as ``intense, indeed, and at times
very heated.'' He said the standoff between NATO and the Yugoslav
president ``can only be called an emergency.''
Italy on Monday authorized the use of its military bases for any
NATO raid, while the outgoing German government said it intends to
allow German warplanes to participate in any attack.
In Paris, French Defense Minister Alain Richard said his country
would provide around 40 aircraft for possible airstrikes, which
could last ``several days.''
The major obstacle appeared to be Holbrooke's request that
Milosevic agree to an expanded international monitoring mission to
verify compliance with demands of the U.N. Security Council.
The Security Council demands include an immediate cease-fire, a
withdrawal of special troops in the province, allowing refugees to
return home and beginning talks with independence-minded ethnic
Albanians on Kosovo's future.
The Pentagon was making military preparations if Holbrooke's
mission failed. Six U.S. B-52 bombers arrived in Britain on Sunday
and a contingent of A-10 antitank planes flew from Germany to
Italy.
The positioning of more U.S. planes within range of Yugoslavia
and preparing them for attacks were clearly designed to convince
Milosevic of Washington's resolve to force compliance with U.N.
demands.
