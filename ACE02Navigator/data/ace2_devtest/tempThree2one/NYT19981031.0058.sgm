The European Space Agency labored in obscurity for many years,
achieving dozens of feats in the heavens that were ignored by most
Europeans. Then, in 1983, Europe's first astronaut soared into
space aboard a shuttle. Suddenly, millions of television viewers
across the continent were glued to their sets, watching a
good-looking European explorer risk life and limb on the high
frontier.
Officials at the agency's headquarters in Paris were ecstatic.
Eager for more, they quickly got the same religion as their
counterparts in America, the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, which long ago had mastered the art of promoting
space-age heroism.
Belatedly, the Europeans discovered that public enthusiasm for
sending people into space, a venture steeped in risk and danger,
drama and the right stuff, was a sure way to win political support
for space exploration and its great costs.
``Two years ago nobody would have dreamed of actively pursuing
this kind of program,'' Jacques Collet, the head of long-term
planning for the European Space Agency, said shortly after the
televised coup prompted the agency to plan dozens of astronaut
flights.
Last week the agency's officials turned out in force at Cape
Canaveral, Fla., for another lesson in space-agency showmanship as
NASA skillfully orchestrated both a high-stakes drama and a
world-class nostalgia trip by sending 77-year-old John Glenn back
into orbit.
For Glenn's flight aboard the space shuttle Discovery, NASA
succeeded in drawing to Florida an estimated 250,000 people and one
of the largest contingents of journalists (2,500) ever to cover a
space launching. But even on slow days, the agency has managed to
turn the Kennedy Space Center into a top tourist attraction, with
tour buses and souvenir shops, its attendance somewhere behind that
of Disney World.
NASA's public-affairs and educational arms, with hundreds of
employees coast to coast after 40 years of growth, are the envy of
other federal agencies. They give tours, publish magazines, set up
satellite feeds for television networks, develop course material
for teachers, run Internet Web sites, promote high-tech gadgetry
and regularly hustle out astronauts to meet an admiring public.
Critics say NASA's celebrity culture and love of the
entertainment side of exploration are stifling the more challenging
work of sending humans and robotic probes to study distant worlds.
``This is an agency that's living in the past,'' said Alex
Roland, a former NASA historian who heads the history department at
Duke University. ``They're endlessly repeating the Apollo formula _
sending up astronauts, taking pictures and then sending them out on
lecture tours.''
Yet the shuttle flights always have a hefty dose of legitimate
science. In this case, it is aging research with Glenn, and dozens
of other experiments.
But science aside, NASA is heavy with television crews and
telegenic space voyagers, and it knows exactly how to go about
building a political constituency to support its hefty budget,
which at $13.7 billion this year is down from old heights.
So do a growing number of space agencies around the world that
are happy to follow the leader and grab onto NASA's lavish
coattails; the shuttles alone have cost American taxpayers some $70
billion so far.
Last week at Cape Canaveral, scores of Spanish journalists and
television crews, as well as the crown prince of Spain and other
dignitaries, joined in the frenzy to witness the launching not only
of Glenn but also of Spain's first astronaut, Pedro Duque, 35, an
engineer from Madrid who, according to his NASA biography, enjoys
swimming and cycling.
``It's neat to see everybody jump on the excitement bandwagon,''
said Joel Wells, a spokesman at the Kennedy Space Center, referring
to the journalists, ``and hopefully they'll stay.''
Raising the adrenalin levels of Americans can be difficult these
days because the public has become so blase, especially since the
astronauts do the same old thing _ circle the Earth. Still, as the
Glenn extravaganza suggests, the space agency has some innovations
likely to jack up the thrills and chills _ if not satisfy critics.
As NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin put it delicately in
announcing the senator's flight: The agency is working hard these
days not only to benefit but ``inspire people.''
Of course, the razzmatazz can backfire. A dozen years ago, the
agency wanted to inspire people by enlisting the first private
citizen, Christa McAuliffe, a high school teacher. Among the 2,500
guests NASA invited to the launching of the Challenger space
shuttle were 112 teacher finalists from the competition, two from
each state and territory, who were to fan out afterward to spread
the gospel.
After tragedy struck, killing all seven astronauts aboard the
Challenger, Glenn joined the experts saying the risks of space
flight should bar civilians and celebrities until the shuttle had
proven itself more reliable. ``This is not a Greyhound bus going
from Washington to Columbus,'' he told reporters. ``This is a
research vehicle.''

Today, convinced that the shuttles are safer, NASA is revamping
its star system. When the agency announced the Glenn flight in
January, it also disclosed that Barbara Morgan, an elementary
school teacher who trained as a backup for the Challenger flight,
would get a new chance. Her astronaut class is to graduate in the
year 2000, after which she will be assigned to a flight and no
doubt broadcast lessons to schoolchildren.
Experts agree that the biggest show on the horizon is the
International Space Station, an outpost bigger than a football
field that teams of astronauts are to build, service and repair.
The first supply flight for the station's construction is set for
later this month.
The endeavor will be extremely dangerous for those sent into
orbit, given the station's size, complexity and all the space
walks. The outpost's size alone makes it a huge target for
asteroids and space debris.
But given the thrill factor, and NASA's diplomatic salesmanship,
the space station is already an international hit. Its 16
participants are Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany,
Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Russia, Spain, Sweden,
Switzerland, Britain and the United States. Most of the countries
expect their astronauts to join in a nearly endless series of
broadcasts and dramas from space that could start as early as next
year as the first modules are assembled in orbit.
Some critics fear that the $50 billion project will cripple more
worthy missions, including robotic ones. Others fault it as far too
timid, arguing that manned missions should push for Mars and
beyond, perhaps to the Jovian moon Europa, which shows signs of
harboring the solar system's deepest ocean and perhaps alien life.
Dr. Bruce Murray, a scientist at the California Institute of
Technology and president of the Planetary Society, a private group
in Pasadena that backs space exploration, disagreed. He said the
station, by uniting former enemies and galvanizing worldwide
interest, is a potent political and technical first step toward the
exploration and colonization of other worlds.
NASA's public-relations campaign, he added, should be no
distraction from the serious scientific and technical aims of the
shuttle and station programs, nor from legitimate yearnings.
``The drama of humans going away is terribly appealing,'' Murray
said. ``That's why there's all this interest in Glenn. He's going
out in space. You can't overestimate the significance of that.''
