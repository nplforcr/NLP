The coalition announced agreement on the distribution of cabinet posts, but
will wait until Thursday before announcing who gets which job. The head of
the largest party, Meekali Jurinda of the Slovak Democratic Coalition, is
expected to be the next prime minister. The foreign minister will probably
also be a member of the Slovak Democratic Coalition, or SDK, which, despite
its name, is a single party. The SDK will get nine of the twenty government
posts. The three other parties in the new government are the ex-Communist
Party of the Democratic Left, which will get six seats; the Party of Civic
Understanding, with three; and the Hungarian Coalition Party, which will
have two posts in the new government. The four parties in the new
government won a commanding 62 percent of the seats in parliament, ending
the long and controversial administration of former Prime Minister Vladimir
Metchiar. The September election was seen by many as a referendum on Mr.
Metchiar, who was widely criticized at home and in the west for his
autocratic leadership. His government's policies helped keep Slovokia out
of recent expansion plans of NATO and the European Union. Critics say Mr.
Metchiar failed to honor the rule of law, abused the public trust, and
mismanaged the economy. Although the country has enjoyed a high growth
rate, the political atmosphere has kept foreign investment at a minimum,
and the country is still burdened with many large, inefficient, state-owned
enterprises. The Metchiar government left Slovokia increasingly isolated
from its neighbors in Central Europe -- Poland, Hungary, and the Czech
Republic. The incoming prime minister faces formidable challenges in
turning his country into an effective market democracy. Art Shine, VOA
