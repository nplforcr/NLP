The council held its third consecutive day of discussions on a Security
Council statement proposed by Russia. In the latest meeting U.S. diplomats
propose provisions of two key elements of the statement. Russian diplomats
say they are waiting for further guidance on the issue from Moscow. The
U.S. revisions would remove a sentence expressing regret that force was
used against Iraq. The United States also wants to change the wording of
requests for assistance from UN Secretary General Kofi Annan. U.S.
officials say Mr. Annan is welcome to play a diplomatic role and assist
with humanitarian issues, but they say they do not want him to intervene in
disarmament issues unless specifically asked to do so by the Council. Max
Rustin, VOA News, United Nations.
