LOS ANGELES _ On Saturday night, the Glass House dance club in
nearby Pomona was packed with 800 people enjoying the holidays when
the local police, federal agents and members of a Los Angeles
County hazardous materials team walked in and stopped the music.
It was almost midnight and for the next four hours no one was
allowed to leave.
A few minutes earlier someone had called 911 and reported what
has suddenly become a common threat across the Los Angeles area in
the holiday season: The caller said the lethal bacteria anthrax had
been released in the club.
But like the other half-dozen anthrax threats made this month by
mail and telephone, the report at the Glass House was a hoax.
``It just seems to be the wacko's flavor of the month,'' said
FBI spokesman Frank Scafidi. ``It used to be you called in a bomb
threat. Everybody gets freaked. You shut down the operation. The
perp got his kick. This is just the 1998 version.''
In the last month, nearly 3,000 people were evacuated and
detained for hours after anthrax threats were received at
courthouses, schools, stores and, most recently, the Glass House.
Colorado, Kentucky and Tennessee have also been subject to anthrax
threats in recent months.
Now, Los Angeles authorities are reassessing how they handle
such calls, searching for the best balance between protecting the
public and not wasting time and money on hoaxes. There is talk of
scaling back the response the next time someone calls in and
mumbles he or she has released anthrax into the air. They are quick
to add that each situation will have to be evaluated and treated
individually.
``We're trying to fine-tune our response,'' said Dr. Laurene
Mascola, chief of the acute communicable disease control unit of
the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services. ``We're
trying to treat it like any other hoax.''
Mascola said the authorities may stop their practice of
detaining people for hours while they search a threatened building
and instead send people home if there is no clear evidence of
danger. At the night club, the authorities took the names and
telephone numbers of all the patrons and then handed out pamphlets
on anthrax and the proper way to decontaminate at home.
``That adds to people's anxieties and it's positive feedback for
the people who are doing the hoax,'' she said. Anthrax is not easy
to spread or catch and it is not contagious from person to person.
If it were released there would be plenty of time to administer
medical treatment to anyone infected.
Mascola said she and her staff have had to spend considerable
time answering questions about anthrax instead of concentrating on
less sensational and every day problems.
``Can I sleep with my wife?'' a man asked her after being
detained.
``Can I give it to my horse?'' someone else asked.
Still, finding the right balance between shrugging off a prank
caller and responding to a possible emergency is not always easy.
``You can't afford to ignore one,'' said Robert Blitzer, who
recently left the FBI after directing its section on domestic
terrorism. ``You must attend to each and every one of them even
though you know that most will turn out to be hoaxes. Because the
one time you don't, it might be wrong, and there's no margin for
error.''
So far, the authorities say they believe that the Los Angeles
area threats are not related and appear to be the work of a litter
of individual copy cats.
Steve Ruda, a hazardous waste expert with the Los Angeles City
Fire Department, speculated that anthrax may have been chosen for
the hoaxes because talk of chemical warfare has been in the news
recently.
The first threat came in a letter to a woman, apparently in a
domestic dispute, Ruda said.
``For thirty five cents, the price of a phone call, they're
tying up all this manpower,'' said a disgusted Jim Nishida, a
supervisor in the Los Angeles County Fire Department's hazardous
material division. ``We can't be doing this continuously.''

About 2:30 p.m. Dec. 18, a call was received at the clerk's
office in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Woodland Hills. The caller
said ``there may be anthrax in our air conditioning system''
recalled Dolores Molina, a court manager.
The call was transferred to the U.S. Marshal's Service, which
decided to evacuate the 90 people in the building, including court
staff, janitorial workers, probation department workers and members
of the public.
They proceeded calmly to a parking lot, which was roped off with
yellow caution tape.
No one was allowed to leave until about 10:30 p.m., she said,
while a hazardous materials team took sample of the air in the
building.
As the team worked inside, Ms. Molina and her co-workers were
given blankets, pizza and donuts and a portable toilet was brought
in.
The week before, an old-fashioned bomb threat was phoned in and
Ms. Molina said the workers viewed the anthrax incident as more of
a hassle than a threat.
``Some of the employees,'' she said, ``were saying they were
disgusted they had to go through it.''
Three days later, nearly 2,000 people were evacuated from the
Superior and Municipal Court buildings in Van Nuys after someone
called 911 shortly after 11 a.m.
They were detained until about 4 p.m.
``You have to always treat a threat as real,'' said Mark
Whaling, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Fire Department.
``Monday morning quarterbacking will eat us alive if we make a
mistake.''
