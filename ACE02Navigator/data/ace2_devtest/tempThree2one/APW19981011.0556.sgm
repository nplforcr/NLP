Swisscom: asset-value cuts over dlrs 700,000 in Asia, Europe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland's telephone company
Swisscom said Sunday it has adjusted its books to reflect 942
million Swiss francs (dlrs 725 million) in shrunken values of
investments in Asia and Eastern Europe.
Spokesman Werner Nuber said the company had long since informed
Swiss authorities of the downward adjustments to the value of its
assets over three years, reported earlier Sunday by the weekly
SonntagsBlick.
The main investments affected include those in the European
Unisource alliance, which it has shared with AT and T, Dutch and
Swedish partners; Malaysia's Mutiara Telecom; and India's Aircel
Digilink, the company said.
But Swisscom said it still regards its investments in the
turbulent markets as having long-term promise despite problems from
1995 through 1997.
The government-controlled Swisscom, formerly the
telecommunications arm of Switzerland's postal service, has begun
selling shares to the public, with an initial offering of about 30
percent of the firm's share capital earlier this month.
Nuber refused to characterize the writeoffs as losses and
rejected comparisons with UBS, Switzerland's and Europe's largest
bank.
Last month UBS said market turmoil would cause it an after-tax
loss of up to 1 billion francs (then dlrs 720 million) in the third
quarter of 1998.
