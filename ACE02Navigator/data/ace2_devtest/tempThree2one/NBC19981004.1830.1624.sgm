Finally tonight, America's latest cultural export.
It's a street-smart combination of music, fashion and lots of attitude.
And it's helping young people make a very public statement in a society
very sensitive to tradition.
Here's NBC's kiko Itasaka.

Straight from urban America to the streets of Japan, most
definitely unjapanese.
But for many, hip hop is the happening thing.
This D.J. says it's more than a fad.
<TURN>
It's grounded.
And I thought it was going to fade away.
But it gets stronger and stronger.

Music is just part of it.
Japanese teens are dressing and, yes, even looking the part.
It requires a substantial investment of time and money.
Nine hours, $900.
Some last minute touchups.
Then it's off to Tokyo's hip-hop club scene.
You might ask why this music and dance born in America is so popular.
Hardly anyone speaks English and they can't follow the words.
But they say it doesn't matter because they still get the message.
American dancer Thomas Paul says the rebellious attitude of hip-hop speaks
to young Japanese and helps them to break away from their conformist
heritage.
<TURN>
Everything says do what we tell you.
They're saying, we're tired of this.
With it as it is right now, the Japanese youth are looking for their role.

For this girl it is an escape.
<TURN>
I listen to the music and I feel good when I'm dancing.

This is not the first time American culture has been embraced by
Japan.
But right now, hip-hop is a hot seller, enjoyed by people of various ages.
