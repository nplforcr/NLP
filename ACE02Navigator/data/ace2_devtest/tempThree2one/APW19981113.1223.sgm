SHEFFIELD, England (AP) _ The difference between ``The Full
Monty'' and ``The Full Monarchy'' is elemental: Prince Charles
keeps his clothes on.
But the heir to the throne was a hit nonetheless Friday at a
50th birthday party staged in his honor featuring cast members from
the hit film about unemployed Sheffield men who turn to stripping.
The icing on a birthday cake in the shape of a security guard's
cap proclaimed ``The Full Monarchy.''
Taking a lead from Hugo Speer, who played ``Lunchbox'' in the
1997 film, Charles quickly mastered the steps and joined in
recreating the scene where the men start dancing while waiting in
line at a job center.
``I've even been given a bit of choreography on how to do things
in a queue,'' Charles said.
``He's a cinch _ a natural,'' Speer said of the prince. ``He
asked for a few tips but didn't need them. It looks like he's been
practicing in his bedroom.''
During an earlier visit to a drug rehabilitation center in
Sheffield, Charles encountered a warm admirer in 78-year-old Elaine
Glaza.
``Can I kiss you?'' she asked.
``Absolutely,'' said Charles, and some bystanders shouted ``Go
on, Charlie!'' Mrs. Glaza also gave him cufflinks and a carnation.
Later Friday night, Queen Elizabeth II hosted a glittering party
at Buckingham Palace, attended by royals and VIPs for the worlds of
architecture, science, farming, politics and poetry.
She toasted his ``vision, compassion and leadership.''
``Here Here,'' the guests exclaimed as the palace ballroom
echoed with applause.
Referring to the queen as ``Mummy, coupled with your Majesty,''
the prince replied he did not know how either of his parents had
``put up with'' him.
Charles, who reaches the half-century mark Saturday, began his
birthday celebrations Thursday night with a private party at
Hampton Court Palace.
Camilla Parker Bowles, Charles' longtime love, was among the
guests Thursday, but the event produced no pictures of the two of
them together. She is hosting a party for Charles on Saturday at
Highgrove, his country home.
