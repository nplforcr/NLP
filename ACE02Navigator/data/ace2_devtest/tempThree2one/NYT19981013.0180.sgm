Brooks Brothers is getting into the wine business. But please,
hold the jokes about buttoned-down merlot and pinstriped
chardonnay.
As many charge customers of the venerable haberdasher already
know (a brochure went out recently with the monthly bills), the new
venture is called Brooks Brothers Cellar, and it is strictly a
mail-order business. So no, you won't be able to drop into your
nearest Brooks Brothers store for a pair of socks and an '82
Latour.
It works like this: Send Brooks Brothers Cellar $30 a month,
plus shipping, and it will send you two bottles of wine.
Subscriptions, if that's the appropriate word, are for three, six
or 12 months.
The 180-year-old company is moving into wine cautiously. The
program is available in only three states, New York, New Jersey and
Massachusetts, but there are plans to expand it to about 20 other
states that permit selling wine by mail.
Brooks Brothers Cellar is the latest in a series of moves by the
clothier to attract a newer, younger clientele and update its image
while taking advantage of its famous name. The company recently
licensed its name to a line of eyewear. ``Brooks Brothers is a
slumbering giant,'' said Barbara Barry, a Los Angeles designer
hired to polish the company image.
As Paul Gitter, the Brooks Brothers executive overseeing the
wine program, put it: ``This is a life-style brand. It has immense
possibilities, and we plan to exploit them all.''
Wine clubs like this one are not new. Windsor Vineyards, a
subsidiary of Rodney Strong Vineyards in Windsor, Calif., in Sonoma
County, has sold wine by mail for more than 30 years. Windsor sells
only its own wines, generally priced at $9 to $20. Its specialty is
personalizing the labels for weddings and birthdays.
Mail-order wine is billed as a bargain but rarely is, if for no
other reason than that the customer must pay shipping charges.
Money-saving claims are difficult to back up because many of the
labels are obscure or unknown. Knowledgeable customers can usually
do just as well or better in wine shops.
Wine by mail rarely attracts savvy customers. While some
wine-club clients prefer mail-order wine because of the convenience
or because they have no good wine shops nearby, others are
attracted to it because they know little about wine and prefer
having someone else select it for them.
Brooks Brothers Cellar subscribers can order two bottles of wine
a month for a minimum of three months for a total of $90, or $15 a
bottle. The shipping charge, $6.95 a month, will be waived for the
first month for the store's charge-card holders.
Members can select the color of their wines _ all red, all white
or a mixed order of red and white _ but not the wines themselves.
No need for concern, Brooks Brothers says. Its brochure assures
that ``these are wines to remember; full-bodied, crisp, or
classic.''
How does a clothing business come to address its customers in
wine jargon? It hires someone else to do the job. Brooks Brothers'
program is run by Geerlings &AMP; Wade, a 20-year-old direct marketer
of wine and wine-associated products in Canton, Mass., near Boston.
Geerlings &AMP; Wade sells directly to most of its customers,
attracting them to its own wine club through brochures, catalogs
and telephone sales. It has also run programs like the one it has
set up for Brooks Brothers. ``We've done them for Century 21 and
the Brookstone chain,'' said Jay Essa, the president and chief
executive, referring to the real estate company and the catalog and
retail concern.
Geerlings &AMP; Wade's own customers can buy its wines only in six-
and 12-bottle cases. Prices range from as little as $7 a bottle to
as much as $80 for a wide variety of domestic and imported wines.
The more expensive labels often bear familiar names like Joseph
Phelps, the Napa Valley winery, and the Hospice de Beaune in
Burgundy, but the lower-priced wines often have little-known or
unknown names. In fact, Geerlings &AMP; Wade owns more than 20 names,
which it uses on domestic wines it buys at low prices in the
California bulk-wine market.
Its customers can be excused for being confused by names like
Glass Ridge, J. Krant Cellars, Lapis Lazuli Winery and Vineyards,
Rose Valley and St. Carolyne Winery. These places don't exist; they
are brand names Geerlings &AMP; Wade can use as it sees fit.
Should Brooks Brothers Cellar members be more demanding,
Geerlings &AMP; Wade will almost certainly be ready to oblige them. Its
current catalog offers fine Bordeaux like Chateau Clerc Milon and
California cabernets like Joseph Phelps' Insignia at prices up to
$840 a case, about what they cost in retail shops.
Brooks Brothers is entering wine by mail at a time when the
business is under broad attack from part of the wine trade and from
the government. Wine sales are regulated by a bewildering array of
laws that vary from state to state but generally require winemakers
and importers to sell only to licensed distributors, who are then
required to sell only to licensed retailers. Direct-mail operators
are accused of bypassing this three-tiered system and also of
avoiding state taxes the distributors must pay.
Wine distributors are solidly opposed to any form of wine by
mail and, under pressure from them, many states have been
tightening the rules. Geerlings &AMP; Wade says it conforms to the
system by holding retail licenses for warehouses in 14 states that
are supplied by licensed distributors. It collects taxes in all
states where the law requires it to, Essa said. ``We're confident
that we're in compliance with the laws wherever we operate,'' he
added.
But Brooks Brothers' principal concern is, of course, customer
response to an untried venture. If it works, buttoned-down merlot
may not be so far-fetched after all.
