Sutter Home Moscato 1996, California. About $5.
No that's not a misprint; the price of this wine is $5 _ and
that's the suggested price. You could probably find it somewhere
for even less, but why bother? It's a remarkable bargain at $5.
The Trinchero family, who own Sutter Home, have been making this
remarkable little dessert wine for almost half a century. I first
discovered it at a tasting a few months ago and wondered where it
had been all my life. It has, to me, a citrus bouquet and a
delightful blend of peach and apricot flavors. Most important, it
has the acid it needs to balance the sweetness, so it isn't flabby
or sugary.
If you are seeking a Sauternes-like subtlety, look elsewhere. If
the idea of a delightful, uncomplicated aperitif at a delightful,
uncomplicated price appeals to you, here is the wine.
