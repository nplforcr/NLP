XIAMEN,China, Oct. 10 -  
From the bluffs along the edge of this booming Chinese city, you can easily peer 
into Taiwan's western frontier, a small island only half a mile away. 

From the early 1950's to 1979, artillery here ritually pounded the nearby 
islands of Jinmen, known in the West as Quemoy, and other locations. 

On these same bluffs today stand giant red characters that repeat, for the 
benefit of nearby islanders who might gaze west with binoculars, China's 
proposal for luring ''renegade'' Taiwan back into the fold: ''One Country, Two 
Systems to Reunify China.'' 

Across the water Taiwan, in response, has put up a huge white billboard calling 
for reunification according to the ''Three People's Principles'' propounded early 
this century by the founder of the Republic of China, Sun Yat-sen: nationalism, 
democracy and better livelihood. 

The dueling signs, erected last year, express the continuing test of wills 
between China and Taiwan -- a struggle that will enter a new phase on Wednesday 
with the first high-level contact in five years between the two sides. 

Although Taiwan and China these days exchange symbolic gestures, even smiles, 
rather than artillery shots, the visit of a senior Taiwan official to Shanghai 
and Beijing is so sensitive that the two sides have not publicly agreed on what 
they will discuss. 

Wary officials on Taiwan insist on calling this ''a visit, not talks.'' They may 
agree on little more than to talk again in the future. But because the stakes 
are so high, people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, and in Washington, will 
be scrutinizing every inflection. 

China sees recovering sovereignty over Taiwan as the unfinished business of the 
civil war that brought Communist victory on the mainland in 1949. China 
ceaselessly calls the recovery of Taiwan its overriding foreign policy goal. 

Taiwan, which has created prosperity and democracy, no longer claims, as it once 
did, to house the true government of all China. More and more, its 22 million 
people say they feel an independent identity. 

Taiwan's leaders, mindful of the glowering colossus nearby, still profess to 
want reunification -- some day far in the future, when China, too, is prosperous 
and democratic. For now they insist that China and the world must recognize 
Taiwan as a separate entity. 

In a typical speech on Saturday, the President of Taiwan, Lee Teng-hui, called 
for a ''gradualist approach'' toward unity. 

''We are looking forward to constructive dialogue between the two sides of the 
Taiwan Strait based on the reality of divided rule,'' he said, promising 
continued efforts to break free of the diplomatic strangulation pursued by 
Beijing. 

Visiting China from Oct. 14 to 19 will be Koo Chen-fu, head of the semiofficial 
Straits Exchange Foundation. He is to meet with his Chinese counterpart, Wang 
Daohan, head of China's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait. In 
what is seen as a good-will gesture by Beijing, Mr. Koo is also to meet the 
Chinese President, Jiang Zemin, on Oct. 18. 

Mr. Koo and Mr. Wang held their first, and only, official talks in Singapore in 
1993. Their next scheduled meeting, in 1995, was canceled by China when it was 
angered by President Lee's visit to a class reunion at Cornell University, seen 
as a perfidious effort to bolster Taiwan's independent status. 

The next year, relations became more tense when China conducted missile tests 
near Taiwan during the island's presidential election and the United States sent 
aircraft carriers into the region. 

Since then the United States, worried about being dragged into a conflict, has 
encouraged both sides to resume talks. 

Despite their diverging goals, both sides may feel that their interests are 
served by meeting, said a Western diplomat in Beijing. ''For Taiwan, if China is 
talking it's not attacking, and for China, if Taiwan is talking then it's not 
declaring independence,'' the diplomat said. 

China has called for immediate discussions of the political future, offering a 
deal looser than Hong Kong's in which Taiwan could keep its democracy and even 
its army but come under Chinese sovereignty. Taiwan wants to fend off political 
negotiations, limiting talks for now to practical issues like fishing and 
immigration disputes. 

Complicating the matter, China and Taiwan are increasingly intertwined 
economically and socially, a process China encourages and Taiwan is struggling 
to limit. 

The ties are apparent here in Xiamen, one of China's thriving ''special economic 
zones'' that is host to many Taiwan factories, real estate developments and 
tourists. 

In the last few days, among hundreds of visiting ''compatriots,'' as they are 
always called here, were 24 members of a Taipei golf club who came to play 
Xiamen's three golf courses and sightsee. Also visiting, at the invitation of 
the Elders' Society of Xiamen, were 21 men and women from a Taiwan senior 
citizens' group, who are performing folk songs and dances in several cities. 

More than a million business executives and tourists from Taiwan visit China 
each year, and some 50,000 live here, the Western diplomat said. In contrast, 
Taiwan strictly limits visitors from the mainland. 

Taiwan's investment and trade in the mainland are large and climbing, even as 
its Government tries to enforce its slogan of ''Go slow; be patient.'' 

The Taiwan Government has refused to allow large, showcase investments like 
multibillion-dollar petrochemical and power projects in Fujian Province that 
were planned by the giant Formosa Plastics Group. 

Many Taiwan businesses are chafing at the policy, and the Formosa Group's 
chairman, Wang Yung-ching, has publicly urged his Government to relax it. ''We 
fear we will lose our opportunity'' in China, he said in a recent speech. 

Most important, Taiwan does not allow direct transportation, postal or 
communications links with the mainland. This slows cross-strait business by 
adding costs and forces travelers to spend hundreds of extra dollars looping 
through Hong Kong or Macao. 

Capt. Yao Ming-fu of the Taiwan-owned ship Uni-Pioneer, in Xiamen harbor this 
weekend to pick up cargo that will eventually go to Japan or Southeast Asia, 
expressed the frustrations of shippers and businessmen. 

Taking goods directly from here to Taiwan's main harbor takes about 12 hours, he 
said. But his ship can only carry Chinese-made goods for reshipment onward; none 
can be imported into Taiwan. 

Transporting Chinese goods to Taiwan itself requires a 24-hour boat trip to Hong 
Kong, some bothersome paperwork, then another 14-hour journey to Taiwan, said 
Captain Yao. His parent company, the Evergreen Group, is one of the world's 
largest shippers. 

Taiwan officials have not been able to contain small-scale direct commerce in 
both directions among islands around Xiamen, and people from Taiwan even make 
one- to five-day visits across these waters, say local press reports and 
scholars. 

How long this strange dance between China and Taiwan can continue is unknown. 
China has warned that if Taiwan formally declares independence, it will mount a 
military attack -- a regional catastrophe. Short of such a declaration, what 
action by Taiwan might touch off a harsh response? How long will China's 
patience hold? 

Major agreement in the next three to five years seems unlikely, Fan Xihou, 
director of the Taiwan Research Institute of Xiamen University, said in an 
interview. But after that, he suggested, ''time will be against Taiwan'' as 
China's military and economic strength builds. 

Taiwan, for its part, hopes that it can continue mustering enough strength at 
home and abroad to shape the terms of its future relationship with the would-be 
motherland.
