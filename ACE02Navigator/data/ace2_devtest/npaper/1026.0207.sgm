The number of infant homicides has increased to the point that a baby is killed 
practically every day in the United States, according to the largest study of 
the subject ever undertaken. Though it makes few conclusions about who commits 
these crimes and why, the study suggests how to protect babies at high risk. 

Based on analyses of birth certificates of the nearly 35 million babies born in 
this country from 1983 to 1991 and the death certificates of those who died 
before their first birthdays, the researchers determined that 2,776 of the 
infants were homicide victims. Homicide was the leading cause of death due to 
injury. The infant homicide rate increased to 8.9 per 100,000 births in the 
period from 1988 to 1991, up from 7.2 per 100,000 births in the period from 1983 
to 1987, the researchers found. 

The study, conducted by epidemiologists at the National Institute of Child 
Health and Human Development, is reported in the current issue of The New 
England Journal of Medicine. 

''This study is important for two reasons,'' said Dr. Lawrence S. Wissow, a child 
psychiatrist at Johns Hopkins University School of Hygiene and Public Health, 
whose editorial on the study appears in the journal. ''Infant homicide is a 
subject we don't know very much about. And because this is such a large data 
set, the study brings the subject to public attention.'' 

The two biggest risk factors, the study found, were having a teen-age mother 
and, in particular, being a latter-born child of a teen-age mother. These 
latter-born infants were 10 times as likely to be killed as were infants in the 
lowest risk group: firstborn babies of mothers 25 and older. ''One reason we're 
seeing higher risk in second or later babies is the added stress of taking care 
of more children,'' said Dr. Mary D. Overpeck, the lead author. 

But Dr. Wissow noted that only about 17 percent of the victims had the leading 
risk factors, indicating that other important risk factors were still 
unidentified. He said some of the babies were probably killed by mothers with 
postpartum depression or by mothers, fathers or domestic partners with histories 
of domestic violence. Most of the death certificates did not identify the 
killer. 

But, Dr. Overpeck said, other studies have found that the killer is usually 
either a parent or a stepparent. It is most often the mother when the infant is 
a week old or less, and a male caregiver when the baby is older, she said. In 
her study, 5 percent of the babies were killed the day they were born and half 
were killed by the time they were 4 months old. 

Dr. Overpeck said she did not know why the infant homicide rate was increasing. 
''It's possible that households are under more stress because of more alcohol use 
and drugs,'' she said. ''Some studies of nonfatal child abuse suggest that this is 
the case.'' She noted that the teen-age birth rate leveled off during the study 
period. 

Although there is no proven way to prevent infant homicide, Dr. Overpeck said 
that having nurses visit pregnant teen-agers at home regularly looked promising 
because it reduced the rate of nonfatal abuse, as well as the number of 
latter-born infants, who are at high risk. 

Dr. Wissow said another preventive measure was for obstetricians and other 
health-care givers to identify more pregnant women with a history of depression 
or domestic violence and to help them get the treatment or protection they 
needed.
