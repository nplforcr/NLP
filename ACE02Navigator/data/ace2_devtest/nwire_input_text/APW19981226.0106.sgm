moscow -lrb- ap -rrb- _ prime minister yevgeny primakov on saturday praised russian lawmakers ' speedy initial approval of the draft 1999 budget , calling the vote `` a victory for common sense . '' russia 's lower house of parliament , the state duma , showed widespread support for primakov 's government by voting in favor of the 1999 budget 's first draft on thursday . primakov had said the government needed a budget as soon as possible to turn around russia 's economic slide and begin paying billions of rubles -lrb- dollars -rrb- in unpaid salaries . the budget passage is `` a victory for common sense , a victory for compromise , '' he said , according to the itar-tass news agency . `` we are finding a common language , a common approach . and we will further work intensively with the lawmakers , '' he said . still , some lawmakers have serious problems with the draft . primakov met with regional governors saturday , who say the budget unfairly distributes tax revenue between the regions and the federal government . the regional governors make up russia 's upper house of parliament , the federation council , which must also approve the budget . in the past , the duma , not the governors , have put up the strongest fight over the budget . primakov sounded optimistic about avoiding a standoff with the governors , and said the budget now calls for the federal government to split revenues down the middle . `` we have approached a balance on interests and an optimal distribution of revenues between the federal center and regions , '' primakov said , according to itar-tass . russia 's economy plunged in august when the government stopped propping up the ruble and defaulted on some of its domestic debt . state employers have n't paid many wages on time for years , and the latest crisis only worsened the problem . when he was selected as prime minister in september , primakov made paying back wages one of his top priorities . but he has been unable to overcome the country 's mounting salary debts , which total roughly 80 billion rubles -lrb- dlrs 4.1 billion -rrb- . `` this is the question of questions , and attention to it must on be lessened , '' he said of the wage crisis on saturday .
