frankfurt , germany -lrb- ap -rrb- _ former world war ii slave laborers under the nazis said on thursday they would fight a plan by germany 's government and industry to set up a compensation fund , saying the proposed settlement was an attempt to bypass their claims . `` the survivors are ready to work toward a solution _ but they will not be shut out and the german government can not stop their claims , '' the group said in a statement faxed from their lawyer 's office in the united states . before taking office last month , chancellor gerhard schroeder 's government said a group comprising government and industry will work out a plan to settle back-wage claims from world war ii-era slave laborers . among those participating in the group are the bosses of allianz insurance company , dresdner and deutsche banks , volkswagen , bmw , siemens , krupp , degussa and basf . it will be headed by schroeder 's chief of staff , bodo hombach . the plan is an attempt to `` bargain away our claims , '' survivor paul frenkel said in the statement . he did not elaborate on how that was being done , and the german government has not announced any specifics on a payment plan . an alternative group comprising class action claimants , slave labor survivors , the jewish claims conference , german industry and banks and the german government should meet and agree on a settlement , group lawyer michael witti said in the statement . the survivors called on the german government to recognize their right to settle their claims individually or on a class action basis , pointing to the recent 1.25 billion dollar settlement reached with swiss banks on holocaust victims ' accounts there that had never been settled . new york-based lawyer ed fagan and munich-based witti will accompany representatives of the group on a two-day trip to frankfurt friday and saturday , where they will press their claims . estimates on the number of slave laborers used by the nazis run as high as 9 million , many of the them from eastern europe .
