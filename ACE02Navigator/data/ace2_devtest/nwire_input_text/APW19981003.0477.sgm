riga , latvia -lrb- ap -rrb- _ those who could vote saturday on whether to ease citizenship laws for hundreds of thousands of stateless ethnic russians were often confused , and those who could n't were stony with resentment . a referendum held in conjunction with voting for the country 's 100-seat saeima parliament asked voters if they want to reject liberalizing citizenship law amendments that the parliament passed in june . the amendments were passed after a tense spring in which russia threatened trade sanctions against diminutive neighbor and rained a hot barrage of denunciations , including moscow mayor yuri luzhkov 's characterizing latvia as committing genocide . meanwhile , the west was unhappy with latvia , though its statements were more measured . the organization for security and cooperation in europe urged changes and many officials predicted that the european union , which latvia ardently wants to join , would never let the country in unless it lowered the obstacles to citizenship . but after the amendments were passed , a referendum drive to overturn them began , spearheaded by nationalist politicians who claim latvian national identity is imperiled . after latvia became independent of the soviet union in 1991 , citizenship was granted to ethnic latvians and to anyone who had lived there prior to the soviet annexation in 1940 . that left out the hundreds of thousands of ethnic russians who poured into latvia during soviet rule , and to their children even if born in latvia . today , about 452,000 of the country 's 740,000 ethnic russians are without citizenship . because they ca n't vote , they regarded saturday 's referendum with angry resignation . `` i was born in riga , i live in riga , but i am russian and ca n't vote . i do n't like it here , '' said a young woman who gave her name only as alex , selling cassettes in the vast market that sprawls in and around five old dirigible hangars on the outskirts of downtown . but many people who could vote were annoyed because the referendum question was phrased confusingly : a `` yes '' vote meaning `` no '' to the changes . `` frankly , i did n't understand the issue or the ballot , '' said 79-yar-old dzetins alois , who voted in the parliamentary election but not in the referendum . he was n't alone . the central elections commission said that as of 4 p.m. -lrb- 1300 gmt -rrb- , about 55 percent of the 1.3 million people eligible to vote had cast ballots in the election , but about 52 percent in the referendum . some voting irregularities were reported , including president guntis ulmanis giving a television interview inside a polling station , and a polling place in the city of jurmala failing to stamp about 200 ballots properly . the referendum apparently slowed down voting procedures and elections commission head arnis cimdars said he was concerned the pace might be too slow to have voting completed on time . of the 21 parties and alliances seeking seats in the saeima -lrb- pronounced sigh-mah -rrb- , the right-wing fatherland and freedom party of prime minister guntars krasts was the only major party campaigning to turn down the changes . but even that party 's support on the issue was not universal . harijs vasilievs said he voted for fatherland and freedom party because he liked their economic polices , though he voted against the referendum `` i think russian children born in latvia should be given citizenship , '' the 61-year-old vasilievs said . `` they are not to blame for the situation they have found themselves in . '' on issues other than citizenship , like the need to seek eu and nato membership , there is wide agreement among the parties . there is also broad support for the free-market reforms that have raised latvia up from the stagnant soviet era . voter support for one party or another appeared to depend as much on the personality of leaders as on specific issues . the party that has been no. 1 in most pre-election polls with around 20 percent support is the center-right peoples party , a new party founded by wealthy businessman and a former prime minister , andris skele . skele has said latvia relies too much on transit trade to and from russia , and said policies should also focus on producing goods in latvia for export .
