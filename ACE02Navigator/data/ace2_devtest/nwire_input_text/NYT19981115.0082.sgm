at a time when the volume of foreign news is dwindling , networks are eliminating foreign news bureaus and newspapers are downplaying reports from overseas , a dozen news organizations are making considerable effort to open news bureaus in cuba . even with some increased access in recent years , the press has been allowed , at best , irregular glimpses into the western hemisphere 's only communist society . with the news friday that the cuban government will permit the associated press to station a permanent correspondent in havana _ for the first time since the ap was expelled in 1969 _ other news organizations have some renewed hope of success . `` we 've had reporters designated as cuban correspondents , going down as often as we can , '' said ann marie lipinski , managing editor of the chicago tribune . `` it 's been an ongoing part of our foreign report . we 'd like to make it a permanent dateline . '' in addition to the tribune , three florida newspapers , three national broadcast television networks and the univision spanish-language network , along with the wall street journal , the new york times and cox newspapers have all sought permission to open bureaus in havana . because of federal prohibitions against u.s. firms ' doing business with the communist regime of fidel castro , the news organizations have sought , and obtained , waivers from the government allowing them to open cuban offices . the hard part is getting the cuban government to agree . while it has granted temporary visas to american correspondents for individual reporting trips , the only american news organization to win permission for a permanent correspondent has been cnn . other news organizations , like the miami herald , have provided coverage offensive enough to the cuban government that they are seldom granted even temporary visas . during a two-year visa drought , the herald has made do by sending correspondents in on tourist visas . `` we cover cuba without physically going there officially _ we go in surreptitiously , '' herald executive editor douglas clifton said . `` we do n't like to , but it 's one of the things we do . '' he pointed out that miami has `` a massive cuban population hungry for news from cuba . '' that population of first - , second - and third-generation cubans , which numbers upwards of 1 million people in dade , broward and palm beach counties on florida 's southeast coast , is a rich source of potential readers for newspapers in the area . the herald , owned by knight ridder , is vying with the tribune co. 's sun-sentinel of fort lauderdale for readers north of miami . both newspapers are among those that have received u.s. _ but not cuban _ permission to open bureaus in havana . clifton was part of a delegation of american newspaper editors who last month traveled to cuba , met fidel castro and raised the issue of new bureaus . `` the answer he gave suggested strongly that he had no interest , '' clifton said . `` that it did n't serve their purposes . that sometimes journalists were not really what they cracked up to be . sometimes they were more spies than reporters . `` so we walked away from it feeling it was a bleak outcome , '' he said .
