los angeles _ on saturday night , the glass house dance club in nearby pomona was packed with 800 people enjoying the holidays when the local police , federal agents and members of a los angeles county hazardous materials team walked in and stopped the music . it was almost midnight and for the next four hours no one was allowed to leave . a few minutes earlier someone had called 911 and reported what has suddenly become a common threat across the los angeles area in the holiday season : the caller said the lethal bacteria anthrax had been released in the club . but like the other half-dozen anthrax threats made this month by mail and telephone , the report at the glass house was a hoax . `` it just seems to be the wacko 's flavor of the month , '' said fbi spokesman frank scafidi . `` it used to be you called in a bomb threat . everybody gets freaked . you shut down the operation . the perp got his kick . this is just the 1998 version . '' in the last month , nearly 3,000 people were evacuated and detained for hours after anthrax threats were received at courthouses , schools , stores and , most recently , the glass house . colorado , kentucky and tennessee have also been subject to anthrax threats in recent months . now , los angeles authorities are reassessing how they handle such calls , searching for the best balance between protecting the public and not wasting time and money on hoaxes . there is talk of scaling back the response the next time someone calls in and mumbles he or she has released anthrax into the air . they are quick to add that each situation will have to be evaluated and treated individually . `` we 're trying to fine-tune our response , '' said dr. laurene mascola , chief of the acute communicable disease control unit of the los angeles county department of health services . `` we 're trying to treat it like any other hoax . '' mascola said the authorities may stop their practice of detaining people for hours while they search a threatened building and instead send people home if there is no clear evidence of danger . at the night club , the authorities took the names and telephone numbers of all the patrons and then handed out pamphlets on anthrax and the proper way to decontaminate at home . `` that adds to people 's anxieties and it 's positive feedback for the people who are doing the hoax , '' she said . anthrax is not easy to spread or catch and it is not contagious from person to person . if it were released there would be plenty of time to administer medical treatment to anyone infected . mascola said she and her staff have had to spend considerable time answering questions about anthrax instead of concentrating on less sensational and every day problems . `` can i sleep with my wife ? '' a man asked her after being detained . `` can i give it to my horse ? '' someone else asked . still , finding the right balance between shrugging off a prank caller and responding to a possible emergency is not always easy . `` you ca n't afford to ignore one , '' said robert blitzer , who recently left the fbi after directing its section on domestic terrorism . `` you must attend to each and every one of them even though you know that most will turn out to be hoaxes . because the one time you do n't , it might be wrong , and there 's no margin for error . '' so far , the authorities say they believe that the los angeles area threats are not related and appear to be the work of a litter of individual copy cats . steve ruda , a hazardous waste expert with the los angeles city fire department , speculated that anthrax may have been chosen for the hoaxes because talk of chemical warfare has been in the news recently . the first threat came in a letter to a woman , apparently in a domestic dispute , ruda said . `` for thirty five cents , the price of a phone call , they 're tying up all this manpower , '' said a disgusted jim nishida , a supervisor in the los angeles county fire department 's hazardous material division . `` we ca n't be doing this continuously . '' -lrb- story can end here . optional material follows -rrb- about 2:30 p.m. dec. 18 , a call was received at the clerk 's office in the u.s. bankruptcy court in woodland hills . the caller said `` there may be anthrax in our air conditioning system '' recalled dolores molina , a court manager . the call was transferred to the u.s. marshal 's service , which decided to evacuate the 90 people in the building , including court staff , janitorial workers , probation department workers and members of the public . they proceeded calmly to a parking lot , which was roped off with yellow caution tape . no one was allowed to leave until about 10:30 p.m. , she said , while a hazardous materials team took sample of the air in the building . as the team worked inside , ms. molina and her co-workers were given blankets , pizza and donuts and a portable toilet was brought in . the week before , an old-fashioned bomb threat was phoned in and ms. molina said the workers viewed the anthrax incident as more of a hassle than a threat . `` some of the employees , '' she said , `` were saying they were disgusted they had to go through it . '' three days later , nearly 2,000 people were evacuated from the superior and municipal court buildings in van nuys after someone called 911 shortly after 11 a.m. they were detained until about 4 p.m. `` you have to always treat a threat as real , '' said mark whaling , a spokesman for the los angeles county fire department . `` monday morning quarterbacking will eat us alive if we make a mistake .
