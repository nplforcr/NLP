washington _ members of congress expressed doubts about russia 's continued role in the international space station wednesday as nasa officials defended plans to help russia finish important components of the program and reduce future dependence on the cash-strapped nation in completing the orbiting outpost . nasa administrator daniel goldin said plans to pay russia $ 660 million over four years for equipment and services connected with the space station were necessary to save the multinational project , and that additional money would be needed to pay other added costs , most of them caused by russia 's financial problems . goldin told a house science committee hearing that russia was a valuable partner in the space station program , but that the agency shared the concerns of many members of congress that the collapse of the russian economy threatened that nation 's major contributions to the project . `` our reliance on russian capabilities has to be reduced , not by eliminating their involvement but by adding layers of protection , '' he said . the bailout money , $ 60 million of which is needed immediately , is necessary to insure that the russian-built service module , the crucial third component of the modular space station , is completed and ready for launching in july 1999 , three months after an april 1999 date set earlier this year . goldin said the $ 60 million was not a gift to russia and would buy the united states added storage space and research time on russian components of the station . rep. james sensenbrenner , r-wis . , who chairs the committee , criticized the national aeronautics and space administration for making russia a partner in the project and letting the troubled nation have such a crucial role . sensenbrenner said nasa had assured congress for years that it was taking steps to insure that russia would not be in such a critical position in the station project that its problems would endanger completion of the station . `` the white house does not want to admit that its management of our relationship with russia is fundamentally flawed , '' sensenbrenner said . `` the president promised me in writing in 1994 that we would not be dependent on the russians to build the international space station , '' he continued , `` and now the administration wants to stick the american taxpayer with the costs of its mistakes , just to hide the fact that it made them . '' rep. tim roemer , d-ind . , a longtime critic of the space station , repeated his call to cancel the project . he noted that a recent nasa audit estimated that each month 's delay in the project cost u.s. taxpayers at least $ 130 million , and predicted even more delays because of russia 's money problems . judyth twigg , an expert in russian affairs at virginia commonwealth university in richmond , va. , told the hearing that russia 's problems run deeper than just a lack of money . since the breakup of the soviet union , russia has not been conducting meaningful research and development in space and its industrial capacity has declined . white house science adviser neal lane said after the hearing that russia is experiencing more financial problems than anyone anticipated when it became a partner in the space station program four years ago . `` we want to work with them on the problems , '' he said , adding that the administration was examining requests from nasa for more money in future budgets to cover increased project costs . goldin said partners in the $ 40 billion space station project , including the european space agency , japan and canada , agreed last week to stay on schedule for launching the first two parts of the station . critics have questioned the wisdom of putting the first two elements of the project into orbit this year and then having to wait months for the much-delayed russian service module . russian space agency officials announced wednesday that they have started launching preparations for the first element , an unmanned maneuver and storage unit named zarya . the module , built in russia but paid for by the united states , is to be launched nov. 20 on a russian rocket . it is to be followed on dec. 3 by the launching of the space shuttle endeavour carrying the first u.s. element , a connecting module called unity . james oberg of houston , an expert on the russian space program , told the hearing that too many doubts remain about the readiness of the service module and other russian-made components to launch the first elements of the station . it would be a mistake , oberg said , to begin launching elements before re-evaluating options for the program , including one that excludes russian involvement .
