the marketers of chanel no. 5 will again ask consumers to `` share the fantasy , '' with a lavish spot that tries to make a sale with a fairy tale . the extravagant , elaborate spot , based on `` little red riding hood , '' will run initially in the united states , to be shown on monday on mtv _ the first time a commercial for chanel no. 5 has appeared on that youth-oriented cable television network . the pitch-cum-fable will be supplemented by advertising in magazines and in stores that sell chanel no. 5 , and then be introduced in slightly different versions in europe . the commercial was conceived by luc besson , the french director of films like `` the fifth element '' and `` la femme nikita , '' with creative contributions from jacques helleu , artistic director at the chanel couture house in paris . it features the model estella warren as a grown-up little red in a riding hood that karl lagerfeld , the designer of chanel apparel , created for the commercial . the spot , which updates `` little red riding hood '' by adding splashes of sophistication and sex , marks a return to the larger-than-life , surrealistic style of advertising that was emblematic of the no. 5 fragrance from 1979 through the early 1990s , most notably in dali-esque commercials directed by ridley scott . `` in a tough world where there are a lot of problems , fantasy is healthy , '' said arie kopelman , president and chief operating officer of chanel inc. in new york , the u.s. unit of chanel . the commercial also exemplifies the ambitious efforts by marketers of venerable brands to keep them fresh as competition intensifies in categories like fashion that are particularly vulnerable to the whims of fickle consumers . the goal is to `` keep an old brand healthy and young , '' kopelman said . `` you have to reach out and bring in new users . '' one way to accomplish that is to continually remake campaigns . for chanel no. 5 , which was introduced in 1921 , chanel has changed commercials five times in the last 19 years , presenting spiels centered on such elements as imaginary pools and gardens , marilyn monroe and the art of andy warhol . `` for a brand that 's over 75 years old , it 's hard to convey modernity , '' said laurie palma , vice president for fragrance marketing at chanel inc. `` advertising helps us keep the brand modern , not just classic . '' and this time , though the commercial is imbued with many fantasy elements , there is a harder-selling orientation as evinced by the appearance of the number five every few moments along with a giant wall of glowing no. 5 bottles . `` the commercial is a fairy tale for big kids , focused on chanel no. 5 in a way we think takes everything we 've ever done creatively full circle , '' kopelman said . the spot starts with music from the film `` edward scissorhands '' and a shot of ms. warren treading a footbridge to an armored door marked with the `` 5 '' from the no. 5 logo . she gains entry with an access code _ yes , 5 . taking a bottle from the wall , she proceeds to the exit . the eiffel tower amid cinematic snow reveals the setting to be paris . `` we looked at not having a french element , '' kopelman said , `` but it 's key to remind people that this product , the first designer fragrance , is after all french . '' suddenly a black wolf emerges , ready to pounce . but beauty prevails over the beast , defusing the attack with a tender shush . as ms. warren departs , the wolf howls and the camera pulls back to show an oversized `` 5 '' on the floor , which then becomes a bottle of chanel no. 5 . the american version of the spot ends with an announcer urging viewers to `` share the fantasy . '' the european version omit those final words and runs longer than the 30-second american version . the spot will make its debut on mtv as part of the plans to reach `` a younger audience , '' ms. palma said , `` which at one point was 40-plus but is now 30-plus or even younger . '' `` one thing we 've learned , '' she added , `` is that young people increasingly talk about escaping from reality and the stress in the world . '' -lrb- story can end here _ optional material follows -rrb- lyle saunders , vice president for creative services at chanel inc. , noted the popularity of extreme sports and computer games with that demographic group as proof of their burgeoning interest in fantasy . in early november , the spot will be shown on two other cable networks watched by younger consumers , vh1 and e entertainment television . a month later , it will begin on broadcast tv stations in 38 big markets around the united states . chanel inc. intends to spend more than $ 3.2 million to advertise chanel no. 5 on television in the fourth quarter , kopelman said , compared with almost $ 1.3 million in the corresponding period a year ago . the magazine ads will run in titles including elle , harper 's bazaar , los angeles , the new yorker and vogue . the in-store advertising will take place at such chains as bloomingdale 's , lord andamp ; taylor , macy 's , nordstrom , robinsons-may and saks fifth avenue . plans call for the commercial to appear in france on oct. 16 and then expand to germany , italy and spain in early december . and if a red-hooded blonde , a wall of perfume bottles and a howling wolf are not sufficient to stimulate additional sales for chanel no. 5 , there is a packaging innovation , too : for the first time , an eau de parfum spray will be sold in the brand 's classic beveled bottle .
