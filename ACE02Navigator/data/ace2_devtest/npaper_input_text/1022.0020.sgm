san diego , oct. 21 - brian cashman was still an assistant general manager with the yankees when an official from the oakland athletics raised the possibility of trading scott brosius to new york last fall . '' i do n't think so , '' cashman told billy beane , then assistant general manager for oakland . '' but let me check with my people . '' cashman was negotiating , of course , immediately responding with lack of interest . but cashman had communicated his own instincts as well : no way . he knew brosius was coming off a bad year , and he knew brosius would be in line to make a decent salary . after cashman and bob watson , then the yankee general manager , checked with their scouts , others assured them that brosius was worth having -- and the rest is history . brosius hammered two home runs tuesday night in game 3 of the world series and singled home the third run of the game tonight to help the yankees wrap up their 24th title . it also helped brosius nail down the series most valuable player award ; he finished with 8 hits in 17 times up (.471) , including 2 homers and 6 runs batted in . for the 13-game post-season , brosius batted .383 with 6 homers and 15 r.b.i. when the game ended , a jubilant brosius leaped several times and then joined his teammates , who jumped on top of each other . later , in a joyous clubhouse , he said , '' to come over here like this , i just feel privileged to be a part of this team . '' holding his m.v.p. trophy , he said : '' i do n't know what to do with this thing . it 's bigger and heavier than anything i 've ever gotten . '' brosius batted .300 and drove in 98 runs during the regular season . in the estimation of his teammate derek jeter , he has been the team 's m.v.p. -- a pleasant surprise to club executives , who had hoped only that brosius would play solid defense and contribute a few hits . '' we did n't know exactly what scott brosius was all about , '' said manager joe torre . '' you pick up a press guide and you see numbers , and last year he was n't that good . '' an understatement : brosius was terrible for oakland in 1997 , a year in which '' everything that could go bad did , '' he recalled . '' everything from just at times swinging the bat horribly to other times swinging the bat pretty good and being unlucky , and just not feeling real healthy , either , '' brosius said . '' it was just one of those things that kind of snowballed , and i was never able to come out of it . '' brosius batted .203 with 11 home runs and 41 r.b.i. , with others on the team feeling as if brosius ' quiet intensity hampered him as his slump deepened . he had batted .304 in 1996 , hitting 22 home runs , but given his age of 31 , it was easy to speculate he was in decline . when beane called cashman after the 1997 season and told him the athletics were intent on trading brosius before the nov. 18 expansion draft , cashman had his doubts . but the yankees needed a third baseman , having determined to allow the aging wade boggs to depart as a free agent , and to exile charlie hayes . cashman called ron brand , the yankees ' west coast scout . '' this guy can play , '' brand told cashman , noting brosius ' strong defense and the fact that he always played hard and was well liked by teammates . even if brosius does n't hit enough to be the everyday third baseman , brand told cashman , he could be an exceptional utilityman , because he could play just about any position . today , brand said : '' i heard some guys talk about how he was complaining , but i never saw that in the way he played . i never saw him complaining in the paper . he was always very gracious . he 's a model citizen . i figured he just had an off year . '' the deal was arranged : the yankees sent kenny rogers and $ 5 million to oakland for brosius , who agreed to a $ 2.5 million contract for 1998 . but the yankees wanted protection , as well , and signed dale sveum to a two-year contract ; they knew , too , that the minor leaguer mike lowell could be an option . by the end of spring training , brosius had won the third-base job and torre was talking about how brosius was the best he had ever seen at charging in and barehanding grounders and throwing to first . he batted .263 in april , but on april 22 , e drove in five runs against toronto 's roger clemens with three hits . this is a guy , cashman thought to himself , that can get big hits , and brosius exploded in may , batting .396 . brosius can be a free agent after this season , and his agent had cursory talks with the yankees in june and july . lowell is waiting for his chance , coming off an exceptional season with class aaa columbus , but re-signing brosius appears to be a priority in the off season . -lrb- he figures to be in line for a three-year deal , perhaps for something in the range of $ 4 million to $ 5 million a season , and has indicated he would take less than his market value to remain with the yankees -rrb- . '' i anticipate we 'll knock it out , '' said cashman , who must also negotiate with free agent-to-be bernie williams . '' ultimately , we 'd like to keep him , though we 're protected with lowell coming up . '' inside pitch the yankees will make bernie williams a contract offer that will certainly be less than what other teams offer , and it may be that williams chooses to return . but williams and yankees officials seemed more resigned that he would not return .
