while london , paris and tokyo are often praised for the quality of their public transportation systems , a new report suggests that the new york region fares surprisingly well in the efficiency of its trains , buses and subways when compared with these cities . the report , based on a joint three-year study by groups in the four urban areas , concludes that these mass transit systems share many common attributes and problems , including highly centralized rail networks , growing business centers at their urban cores , huge populations of commuters and severe automobile congestion . in some respects , mass transit in the new york region compares poorly , particularly in the paucity of service to much of its suburban ring , which forces suburban residents to rely on cars , according to the report . but for new yorkers who hold to a commonly held view that the largest cities of europe , particularly paris and london , have model mass transit systems , the findings of the four-city study may come as a shock . '' one thing it shows is that new york has made a good recovery in the last 30 years in the efficiency of its rail and subway systems , '' said bill shore , a senior associate with the institute of public transportation , a new york city research group that carried out the new york component of the study . for instance , the new york region 's commuter trains , including metro-north , the long island rail road and new jersey transit , were found to be more punctual than those in the other metropolitan areas . -lrb- new york 's subways , however , proved less punctual . -rrb- all three new york regional commuter train systems were found to be punctual more than 90 percent of the time , while the regional rail network around london , long lauded as a model of efficiency , registered only 88 percent on the punctuality scale . the report , released last week in the form of a thick compendium of charts , numerical rankings and other forms of comparative analysis , was the largest study comparing what are perhaps the world 's most advanced large cities in terms of mass transit , its authors say . the other groups participating in the study were the london research centre , the institut d'amenagement et d'urbanisme de la region d'ile-de-france of paris and the tokyo institute for municipal research , all of which received government or philanthropic grants in their own countries . while providing a broad portrait of the vast transportation systems in each metropolitan area and the challenges those regions face from urban sprawl , air pollution and other problems , the study provides many reminders of the differences in how people commute . for instance , more than 500,000 people ride motorcycles into tokyo each day , about 5 percent of its commuting population . but the report found that only about 10,000 motorcyclists brave the new york region 's highways each day , so negligible a number that the report called it zero percent of the total . according to the study 's authors , far more important conclusions reveal a combination of similarities in transit patterns and huge problems that must be confronted . among the comparative findings was that new york city subways trailed their foreign counterparts in punctuality , with 80 percent of the subways arriving close to their scheduled arrival time . by that measure , tokyo 's metro system came out on top , with 97 percent of its trains on time . the report found a big difference among the four regions in the breadth of their mass transit networks . while the new york city subway system has far more stations than its foreign counterparts , the report found that its suburban rail network had far fewer stations . mr. shore said his group had concluded that the biggest challenge for the new york region , as revealed by the three-year study , was finding ways to lure more suburban residents onto trains and other forms of public transportation at a time when there is little hope that extensive new suburban rail lines will be built . near-term approaches to the problem , he said , may include providing better bus connections and more parking at suburban train stations . but he said the vast scale of the problem was more likely to require changes in land-use planning and the rules governing development . the objective , he said , should be to confine development to places already served by mass transit , instead of extending the limits of suburban sprawl farther from existing rail stations or bus lines . '' the only solution appears to be in finding a way to better relate housing and jobs to existing public transportation , '' he said . copies of the report , published by her majesty 's stationery office in london , are available for $ 110 through bernan associates , 4611 f assembly drive , lanham , md. 20706-4391 .
