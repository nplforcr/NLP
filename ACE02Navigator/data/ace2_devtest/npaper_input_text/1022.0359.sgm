in the rehearsal hall , the dialogue was sliced tart and true from the life and times of monica s. lewinsky , with no less than three actresses taking a crack at the ultimate ingenue 's role in the inescapable national melodrama that has no copyright , perchance no ending . the actors as much as the audience seemed mesmerized by the hourlong experiment at the new dramatists playhouse , a scene of grand jury inquisition about sex and love , pride and president and all the attendant folderol that , inevitably , has raised the question of whether this stuff of life can offer something more meaningful through the theater . '' i 'm an insecure person , '' declared the first monica , culver casson , reading the line of grand jury dialogue most sadly in explaining why she seemed so often to be there on those presidential rope lines . '' i would go early and stand in the front . '' the second monica , emme shaw , played it far less for pity than with a kind of savvy innocence . '' can you guys call me monica ? '' she suddenly asked the grand jury amid all the testimony about gifts and stains and embarrassment . '' i 'm just 25 . please . '' and the third monica , abigail rose revasch , a study in wide-eyed , free-fall anxiety , provided a confessional rush in telling of haphazardly falling in love with , well , the president of the united states : '' i thought , i thought : he had a beautiful soul . '' her spotlighted monica was all at sea . '' i do n't know what the truth is anymore , '' she keened . '' i do n't know if it 's based on him being an actor , '' she said of the president , threatening the rehearsal hall , on west 44th street in manhattan , with a play within the play . the strong applause and vigorous audience discussion that followed the reading by the band of 10 actors on wednesday night marked the evening as something more than a stunt . it seemed closer to '' a response to this public distress that we 're in , '' as todd london , the artistic director , put it in his welcome to new dramatists , which has been developing playwrights for 50 years . the evening at least suggested that no plot line is too far-fetched , nor has the nation ever been more provoked to catharsis . with her grand jury chorus compulsively curious but finally empathetic , the young woman chattily described a flirtation suddenly exploding into a huge criminal investigation of the president . no less did the performance feature ludicrous moments , the audience guffawing at the true-from-life notion of the president on crutches being lewdly , hurriedly serviced by the office intern . '' oh my god , this is so embarrassing ! '' said ms. lewinsky as a helpful grand juror gently coached , '' you can close your eyes . '' since the sound of ms. lewinsky has not actually been heard in public despite all the months of washington scandal-traipsing , mr. london rotated three monicas through the dialogue as a sample of the possibilities , and he reduced the grand jury to five members . the transition from the enacted scene to the discussion among the 75 people in the hall seemed well cued by one compassionate grand juror 's troubled line to ms. lewinsky : '' i ca n't figure out why you keep going after things that are n't free . '' or , as the problem was analyzed by moira driscoll , a grand jury actress finally speaking for herself : '' she did n't think through the thong moment . '' far more than that famously impulsive display of undergarment , ms. lewinsky did n't think many things through , the gathering agreed , always wondering why . '' she definitely wanted to be forgiven and to be loved , '' said kate robin , a playwright in the audience . '' and she wins ! the grand jurors loved her . '' they offered her a bouquet at the end , '' she noted of their parting gift . '' it was because she was so honest . '' instantly , another playwright , barry jay kaplan , disagreed . '' no , no , no , '' he said . '' it 's because she has spent a lifetime learning how to do that , how to please . she 's really good at it . '' the now familiar lewinsky effect swept the audience , the inability by all sorts of well-resolved americans not to discuss the tale even as they pronounce it too pathetic for words . '' what about him ? '' came one writer 's question about the president , somewhere far offstage amid ms. lewinsky 's predicament . '' he 's not in this scene , '' another professional dismissively replied , savoring some of the good lines ms. lewinsky gave herself . -lrb- '' inherent in a secret is a lie . '' -rrb- the evening 's director , sabrina peck , a specialist in verbatim dialogue drama on topics like the bosnian refugee tragedy , admitted to doubts about the lewinsky tale 's gravity . '' we 're all disgusted on one level by the whole thing , but maybe there 's some usefulness , '' she said , finally delighted by the strong audience reaction and teased by the advice to '' make the second act linda tripp . '' comic relief continued to the closing lines . the audience laughed at the 12-step parody in a grand juror 's avuncular advice , '' monica , none of us in this room are perfect . '' by then the third monica of the night was weeping in farewell as she was asked if she had anything at all to add to her performance . '' i 'm sorry , i 'm really sorry for everything that 's happened , '' she apologized . then , interrupting her sobs , she added , '' and i hate linda tripp ! '' most mercifully , the audience 's closing burst of laughter suggested the whole thing may prove more of a comedy than a tragedy .
