hardly anyone realizes it yet . but this country may spend the first months of 1999 -- as many as six months -- with the president on trial before the senate . for six days a week , under the rules , the 100 senators would be in their seats on the floor . chief justice william rehnquist would preside . congress , the president and the supreme court would be seriously disabled . that is where the right-wing republicans who are effectively running the impeachment process in the house are taking us . most americans do not want to go there . indeed , they assume that impeachment is a dead issue . but the house may vote next week to impeach the president . how can that be ? henry hyde , who as chairman of the judiciary committee is the formal manager of the process , is widely respected in the house . moreover , he has a strong feeling for our political institutions . yet he is driving toward an impeachment that would damage the presidency and arouse public contempt for congress . why ? some who know henry hyde well say that , on partisan issues , he does not like to stray from the republican line . and the line on impeachment is being set by the republican right . with speaker-to-be robert livingston silent , the commanding voice is that of tom delay of texas , the majority whip , a hard-line conservative . other forceful figures are bill mccollum of florida and bob barr of georgia , who has been demanding president clinton 's impeachment on one ground or another for years . many conservatives have a visceral dislike for bill clinton . they reason that , even if he was acquitted in the senate , impeachment would mark him as not even president nixon was marked . mr. mccollum said the other day that impeachment would satisfy those who '' believe the president should be branded and given the scarlet letter . '' the right is affirmatively opposed to what many people favor : censure instead of impeachment . it would rather lose on impeachment and then use the negative votes of moderate republicans to try to purge them in primaries . republican moderates are under heavy pressure from the right . when representative billy tauzin of louisiana let it be known that he might consider censure rather than impeachment , the far-right magazine human events denounced him as '' pro-perjury . '' his office got thousands of calls . the moderates are also said to have been put off by what mr. delay called '' lawyerese '' in mr. clinton 's reply to 81 questions from the judiciary committee . anyone facing a prosecutor who wants to put him in prison -- as kenneth starr plainly does the president -- will be advised by his lawyer to say as little as possible . even so , mr. clinton could no doubt have been more forthcoming . but what should be in the minds of the republican moderates -- and for that matter conservative democrats -- is history . specifically , the two notorious impeachments in our history : of supreme court justice samuel chase in 1804 and president andrew johnson in 1868 . chief justice rehnquist published a book in 1992 on those two impeachments and trials , '' grand inquest . '' both , he said , were highly political . president jefferson and his supporters went for justice chase because they did not like his judgments . president johnson was attacked by the radical republicans of his day because he wanted to temper harsh policies toward the south after the civil war . if either had been convicted , chief justice rehnquist wrote , '' a long shadow would have been cast '' over the independence of the courts and the presidency . but enough jeffersonians in the senate voted to acquit justice chase . and president johnson was acquitted by a single vote -- that of a republican senator from kansas , edmund g. ross . senator ross was ostracized and impoverished because of his vote . but john f. kennedy listed him in '' profiles in courage , '' saying his '' heroic '' act '' may well have preserved ... constitutional government in the united states . '' the accusers of bill clinton have abandoned all the potentially serious charges : whitewater , campaign finance , filegate . what remains , however ingeniously framed , is lying about sex . to impeach him for that would trivialize a grave constitutional process and cast a lingering shadow on the presidency .
