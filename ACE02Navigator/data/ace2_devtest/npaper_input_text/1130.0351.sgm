mexico city , nov. 30 - the newest danger awaiting motorists on the mean streets of mexico city comes from revolver-waving bodyguards in speeding unmarked cars , who swerve from lane to lane to make sure no one gets close to the chauffeur-driven limousines they follow . a bump from one such escort car almost sent humberto cantu and his humble ford sedan careering into a tree . mr. cantu , a radio disk jockey on his way to work , caught up to the bodyguards at the next stoplight to berate them . one of them pointed a pistol at his nose . '' relax , buddy , '' the man told mr. cantu . '' ca n't you see that we 're working ? '' in the last two years , violent crime in the capital and other major mexican cities has surged out of control while police forces , disabled by decades of corruption , have all but collapsed . so rare is it for the capital 's regular police officers to stop a crime that they often make newspaper headlines when they do . as a result , frightened citizens who need help to defend their loved ones or their property have turned to private security guards , legions of them . the huge growth of private security is a new complication for mexico 's efforts -- so far in vain -- to subdue a tidal wave of crime , especially robbery and kidnapping . most guards are armed but few are trained or licensed , and the authorities acknowledge they have little control over them . abuses against unsuspecting passers-by grow more frequent every day , as do violent crimes by crooks posing as private policemen . '' we have allowed a bunch of fly-by-night security companies to arm a huge number of people , basically an entire army , '' said victor manuel soto camacho , a mexico city councilman from the opposition party of the democratic revolution who is an expert on local crime . '' in many cases our citizens , instead of getting security , are getting more danger . '' in affluent neighborhoods , the bodyguards seem to rule the streets . they strong-arm pedestrians , charge through red lights and brandish weapons , all in the name of defending '' the boss , '' whoever that may be . '' who has not been insulted or threatened ? '' arnoldo kraus , a newspaper columnist , wrote . '' all because we deign to travel on the same street as them . the aggression of those wardens of 25-year-old rich kids and their mercedeses and bmw 's is downright degrading . '' nationwide , 200,000 mexicans are employed as guards by some 3,000 private companies , industry figures show . only 275 companies are properly registered with the government . as many as 90,000 private guards work in mexico city , 11,000 more than the number of uniformed policemen . the tradition of private bodyguards is not new in mexico , which even contributed its own word for them to the spanish lexicon : '' guaruras , '' a term handed down from the aztecs . its original meaning is not known , but the current one , according to a standard dictionary of mexican phraseology , is unambiguous : '' a strong and overbearing individual ready to draw his weapon , who is in charge of protecting another person . '' in past decades only the most powerful politicians and conspicuous tycoons had their own security guards . now practically any office building , middle-class neighborhood or prominent business executive needs protection . even homero aridjis , a leading intellectual who is the president of the writers ' group international pen , travels with burly men at his back since he received telephone death threats late last year . '' we live in a culture of fear , '' mr. aridjis said . '' and we do n't really know if the men watching out for us are good or bad , honest or criminal . '' the guaruras ' style is unmistakable . they gather in forbidding clusters outside business conferences and power-elite restaurants during mexico city 's late-afternoon lunch hour . their vehicles of choice are either a chrysler spirit or a dodge stratus , with hubcaps removed and four doors for quick exit . a heavy black steel grate , known as a burro-bouncer , shields the front fender so the driver can ram other cars without denting his own . subtlety is not a feature . the guaruras all seem to wear shiny suits , black ties and dark glasses . their belts hang heavy with beepers and cellular phones and their jackets bulge with barely concealed handguns . they ride four to a car , each one peering warily out his window . and mr. cantu , the disk jockey , is an example of what happens to the unwary driver who wanders in between them and their clients . '' a professional bodyguard should be discreet , '' said ramon requeijo abad , president of the mexican branch of nutronica , an international security company that is one of the few to fully screen and train its guards . '' but in this country they love to make a show of their arrogance . if there is a fight , they jump in and make it worse . '' most guards are not personal escorts but lowly watchmen , standing duty in stores and building lobbies . often they make less than $ 50 a week , so the incentive is for them to commit crimes rather than prevent them . over the last year the city police have seen a rash of break-ins that appear to be inside jobs by doormen and night watchmen . police chief alejandro gertz manero opened a campaign in mexico city recently to impose tight supervision on the security industry . he wants all guards to be registered and to pass drug , psychological and weapons-handling tests as well as undergo criminal-background checks . mr. gertz started the crackdown after he noticed two police patrol cars escorting a private vehicle , a practice that is prohibited . after stopping the patrol cars himself , he quickly discovered that they were private vehicles illegally painted with the colors of the police force . '' everyone has the right to seek protection for himself , '' mr. gertz said . '' no one has to the right to offend or humiliate others . ''
