in the first ruling of its kind , an appeals court in oregon ruled yesterday that the state constitution gave homosexual government employees the right to health and life insurance benefits for their domestic partners . '' this is , to my knowledge , the first time a court has said it 's unconstitutional not to give benefits to the domestic partners of gay and lesbian employees , '' said matt coles , director of the lesbian and gay rights project at the american civil liberties union . '' and there is no state in the country that provides domestic partner benefits to all government employees . '' but oregon does already provide benefits to the domestic partners of its employees : while the case was on appeal , the state voluntarily began offering such benefits to its direct employees . the employer of the three lesbian plaintiffs in the case , oregon health sciences university , has also voluntarily begun offering such benefits , although it is no longer part of the state , but a separate public corporation . while the ruling today involved only that university , mr. coles said , the decision would apply to every employee of a governmental entity in oregon , expanding the benefits to thousands of teachers , police officers and others who work for local government . robert b. rocklin , the assistant attorney general who argued the case , said he was not so sure . '' i do n't know yet if we 'll appeal , and it 's hard to say exactly what the impact of the ruling would be , '' mr. rocklin said . '' the court dismissed the state defendants because o.h.s.u. is no longer a state entity . it 's not completely clear to me whether it would apply to all government employees in the state . '' the ruling , by a three-judge panel of the state court of appeals , upheld a 1996 trial ruling in the case , finding that the denial of benefits to the three plaintiffs , all nursing professionals in long-term relationships who had applied for medical and dental insurance for their partners in 1991 , violated a section of the state constitution similar to the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment of the united states constitution . in a provision that is echoed in other states , the oregon constitution provides that '' no law shall be passed granting to any citizen or class of citizens privileges or immunities , which , upon the same terms , shall not equally belong to all citizens . '' the three lesbian couples said they were members of a class of citizens , homosexual couples , that was being denied the privilege of insurance benefits . the university argued that it was not discriminating against the class of homosexuals , since it denied insurance benefits to the unmarried partners of all employees , heterosexual and homosexual alike . '' that reasoning misses the point , however , '' the court said . '' homosexual couples may not marry . accordingly , the benefits are not made available on equal terms . they are made available on terms that , for gay and lesbian couples , are a legal impossibility . '' in recent years , many private companies and local governments have voluntarily decided to offer benefits to domestic partners . and new york and vermont , like oregon , provide benefits to domestic partners of their own workers , but not to those who work for local or county governments . while the oregon case is apparently the first in which courts have ordered such benefits , as a constitutional matter , several courts , in new jersey and elsewhere , have rejected the kind of argument that prevailed in oregon . '' this is still a new area of law , and there 's a similar case pending in pittsburgh , '' mr. coles said . '' but when i look at this decision , i think what a difference a decade makes . ''
