hoping to recapture the new york region 's pre-eminence as america 's center of medical and biological research , mayor rudolph w. giuliani is expected to announce today that the city will commit $ 12 million to a major research study on cancer that will involve 300,000 residents whose health and lifestyle will be tracked for two decades . the study , called the new york cancer project , is the first major initiative of a newly created consortium of the region 's 25 leading medical schools , hospitals and academic institutes . they have been longtime rivals but are now eager to take advantage of a boom in federal grant-giving and to lure the nation 's best scientists to the region . during the last 15 years , new york state has slipped from its perch as the top recipient of grants from the national institutes of health , the country 's largest and most prestigious source of biomedical research money . new york is now third behind california and massachusetts . new york city is second behind boston . new york 's turf-conscious medical and academic establishment for years paid little notice to the decline . but it was jolted into action when the federal government recently announced that it would double the n.i.h. research budget during the next five years . '' for the first time , '' mayor giuliani said , '' the city is providing seed money that will launch a major cancer research project that will bring together the unparalleled resources of new york city 's medical community in the fight against cancer . '' officials said every member of the consortium would play a role in the cancer project , with each institution contributing its expertise . '' it is the perfect project to ask for the cooperation and collaboration of all the institutions because it 's quite clear that no one institution could accomplish the ambitious goal they have in place , '' said dr. arnold levine , president of rockefeller university , which will work on the identification of new genes that predispose people to cancer and develop ways to prevent the cancer . the cancer project , which appears to be the largest population-based study in the nation , is unique among such studies because of its size and scope , officials said . the study will include the collection of blood and urine samples , extensive face-to-face questioning of participants about their health behavior and an intensive public education campaign about cancer . '' that sounds very big to me , '' said dr. brenda edwards , the associate director for cancer surveillance research at the national cancer institute , which is part of the n.i.h. and sets aside 80 percent of its budget for external grants . '' i would think they are positioning themselves to be very competitive . '' the new york cancer study is one of a number of long-term , population-based studies under way across the country . others have recruited a smaller number of people . a model for the new york project is the framingham heart study , which has followed the health of more than 5,000 residents in a middle-class boston suburb for 50 years , and in doing so , advanced the nation 's knowledge of heart disease . with cancer expected in a few years to overtake heart disease as the leading cause of death , the new york study will follow residents to see which ones develop cancer and which ones do not . because of the city 's richly diverse population , the project is expected to yield new findings about the genetic and environmental factors related to various types of cancers and other diseases , and lead to better methods for early detection and treatment . '' we will be able to look at whatever cancers are most prevalent in ethnic groups and try to understand why that 's the case so we can ultimately develop treatment , '' said dr. maria k. mitchell , the president of the consortium and a former chairwoman of the health and hospitals corporation board . '' historically , a lot of research has been done in more homogeneous groups . '' the project will take place in two stages , with the first phase seeking to recruit 5,000 healthy new york city residents for an initial two-year period . the project will then grow to include 300,000 new yorkers . the huge volume of information from study participants , whose ages will range from 35 to 64 , will be overseen by the consortium , which was formed a year and a half ago as amdec , for the academic medicine development company . the date will be kept at the various institutions . one of the biggest challenges will be finding recruits and keeping them involved for 20 years , dr. mitchell said . residents , who will receive a $ 50 stipend for signing up , are to be recruited through employers , health care centers and community organizations . city officials anticipate that the cancer project will have substantial economic benefits to the city , generating $ 500 million over the life of the 20-year project . the city 's investment of $ 12 million from the economic development corporation for a two-year pilot project is likely to lead to $ 200 million from the federal government to finance the full term of the project . in addition , hundreds of millions of dollars in financing is expected from philanthropic foundations , businesses , large drug companies and venture capital . the hope is that the project also will reverse trends that have led to only 86 of the top 1,300 biotech companies calling new york state home , and resulted in new york city having the lowest growth rate in biomedical research financing of any of the nation 's top 10 metropolitan areas . in new york city alone , the biomedical sector directly employs 32,000 people , with 16,600 new yorkers employed elsewhere throughout the state .
