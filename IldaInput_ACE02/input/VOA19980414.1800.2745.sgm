 Inspectors and workmen are checking Yankee Stadium to make sure that
 there are no more structural problems after a steel beam in the upper
 deck collapsed Monday afternoon. The first two of three games between the Yankees and
 Anaheim Angels had to be postponed after the two hundred twenty-seven kilogram
 steel beam crashed into the seats. Sonny Hyeth, the Director of Stadium Operations,
 says the beam was part of the original structure built seventy-five years ago.

 We believe that this was an isolated uh incident. It was a piece of the
 stadium that was built in nineteen twenty-three. w- So far we've not been able
 to uncover any other parts of the stadium that have a similar type of expansion
 joint, but we are going to check every one of the joints in the stadium.

 Nearby Shea Stadium will now be quite busy on Wednesday. The Yankees
 will play an afternoon game against Anaheim in the home of the New York
 Mets. And the Mets will play a night game against the Chicago Cubs.
 The mishap is likely to fuel speculation that the Yankees should move
 from the Bronx to a new stadium. New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani says
 both teams are entitled to new facilities.

 Both the Yankees and the Mets are entitled to new baseball fields. I've
 said that over and over again. The uh the best reason for it is that the cities
 that have new baseball fields are substantially out drawing the Yankees
 and the Mets. And these are th- two of the best teams in baseball in the
 largest city in America.

 Yankees' owner George Steinbrenner has often said he wants to move the

 Built.
