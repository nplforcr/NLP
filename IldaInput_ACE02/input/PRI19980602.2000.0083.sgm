 Californians are going to the polls today in what's turned out to be the
 most costly and volatile of primary races. Voter turnout is expected to be
 high. NPR's Kerry Kahn reports.

 The largest number of voters in twenty years is expected to cast ballots in the
 state's first ever open primary. Election officials are hoping for a forty-two percent
 turnout. Topping voter interest is a three way competition for the
 democratic gubernatorial race. At one point in the lively primary
 contest, each of the three leading candidates have held the first and last
 place positions in the polls. Currently lieutenant governor Gray Davis is
 the front runner as voters appear to be turning to his decades of political
 experience over the self-financed campaign of millionaire Al Checchi, and
 trailing in third is congresswoman Jane Harmon, who has apparently been
 unsuccessful in her attempts to tap into the gender gap. Voters will also
 decide on nine ballot initiatives, including one that would curtail labor
 unions' political activities and another that would end the state's
 thirty year old bilingual education system. Kerry Kahn, NPR news, San Diego.
