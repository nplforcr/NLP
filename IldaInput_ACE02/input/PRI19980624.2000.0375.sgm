 On the eve of President Clinton's trip
 to China, there's been further pressure on Beijing to come clean on its
 human rights record, but Chinese authorities are doing all they can to
 ensure there'll be no dissent when the president and his entourage arrive. Today
 it was reported that the former Chinese party leader, Zhao Zujang, has
 written to Chinese communist leaders calling on them to admit it was a
 mistake to use troops to quell the Tiananmen Square uprising. The World's
 Rob Gifford in Beijing says no one was surprised by Zhao's statement that
 Chinese government owes its people an apology.

 Well, I think uh he would say that, wouldn't he, is what many people would
 say. um And uh inevitably he was the party leader who was forced to step down in
 may of nineteen eighty-nine for siding too much with the students during the
 demonstrations, but I think what it does show is that there are still
 people who are willing to speak out, people with some clout like Zhao
 Zujang. And if this letter can be confirmed, which is obviously very
 difficult in Beijing at the moment, some people have said he could emerge as
 something of a figure head in any opposition movement that were to arise in
 future, but it must be said that in the current uh circumstances, I don't see
 that that is uh seen as a likelihood by many people.

 Another sign that people are looking at today is the uh detention of uh a fellow
 named Li Zhao Long who apparently is a dissident there. Tell us who he is and what the
 significance of his detention is.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="465.526" endTime="508.268">
 Well there are people like Mr. Li. A lot of people have said that with the uh eh- g- the
 sending of
 and Wei Jing Chung into exile uh within the last few months,
 uh that all political opposition has been quashed o- or sent out of the country.
 There are people who continue to speak out who are not such high profile
 dissidents, uh so like m- this Mr. Li. But I think the important point here is that
 people like Li, at the moment whatever they say, whatever anybody says,
 that might rock the boat ahead of Mr. Clinton's arrival is being clamped
 down on. So the government is so keen for nothing to cause problems for this
 summit, that if anybody makes a squeak that even seems like dissidence, uh they're
 going to be stamped on.

<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="508.268" endTime="519.476">
 What else is the government doing along those lines, Rob? After all, a lot
 of people are going to be watching what the president does, what kind of
 controls is the government exercising over uh their ability to hear and see
 that?
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="519.476" endTime="566.172">
 Well, as usual, it's going to be very uh high security in Tiananmen Square
 itself, but one of the things that has been reported, again not confirmed,
 is that uh is that American officials hav- uh have complained to the Chinese about uh the
 screening of President Clinton's uh remarks after President Clinton and Mr.
 Jiang meet in the great hall of the people on Saturday. That uh there are reports
 that there's going to be a twenty-second time delay uh so that anything that is too
 overtly pro human rights or too anti-China in any way can be edited out so
 the Chinese people won't see it. I think the ordinary man on the street,
 he's not going to get to see much of Clinton. And to be honest, there seems
 to be more interest in the soccer world cup at the moment than there is in
 the visi- visit of President Clinton.
