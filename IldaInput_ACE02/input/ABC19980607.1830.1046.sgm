 The leaders of the countries that grow illegal drugs and the leaders of the
 countries that use them will meet at the United Nations tomorrow. It's

 Every year, almost five thousand tons of opium, more
 than three hundred thousand tons of coca for cocaine and an estimated one million pounds of
 marijuana and hashish are produced globally. Now the United Nation's drug

 suppliers in ten years.

 Critics say the plan is unrealistic.
