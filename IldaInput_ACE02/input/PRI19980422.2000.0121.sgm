 Human rights groups are protesting Rwanda's plans to execute more than twenty
 people involved in the nineteen ninety-four genocide. Amnesty International says the
 executions scheduled for Friday will not serve the interests of justice and
 will further brutalize Rwandan society. Jose Luis Herrero of the UN
 commission on human rights in Rwanda agrees.

 The UN discourages application of the death penalty, and in that sense,
 this new development that confirms the intention of the government of
 Rwanda to carry out the executions is not seen positively. But at the end
 of the day, it's a sovereign decision of the Rwandan government.

 Rwanda says the executions will show people the judicial process really
 is working. The authorities say justice must be seen to be done.
