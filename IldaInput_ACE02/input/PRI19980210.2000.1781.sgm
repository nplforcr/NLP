 Well, in an unrelated development with an unrelated species, an
 unnamed rat managed to ground a Swiss Air passenger plane at
 Zurich airport for two days.
 The plane had been scheduled to fly to Vienna, home of the
 schnitzel, when a crew member spotted the alleged stowaway
 onboard.
 Passengers were moved to another plane and after a two day hunt
 the furry little gourmand was found, dead, in a trap baited
 with bacon.
 No comment on whether he had managed to enjoy any of the
 inflight snacks.
