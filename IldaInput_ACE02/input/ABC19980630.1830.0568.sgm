 For all the attention we pay to the weather and to the climate, we can't do
 much about it, though the urge to do so is sometimes very strong. Case in
 point California. For years, Los Angeles has been getting half of its
 water from the Owens Valley, about two hundred miles away. And the Owens Valley has
 never been the same. ABC's Jane Clayson is there.

 A clear day can be deceiving in the Owens Valley, because when the wind
 rolls over this dried out lake bed, it whips up the worst air pollution in
 the country, a dust storm that turns this into this. Air so dense you
 can't see across the street. Forty thousand people are affected. But the
 tiny town of Keeler gets the worst of it.

 This is a blight on California that should not exist. It's like a big dust
 pile, a hundred square miles of dust.

 I mean, you can't breathe it. And if you breathe it, you die.

 That's no exaggeration. Three hundred thousand tons of naturally occurring
 toxic pollutants fly off the lake bed every

 Owens Lake was once the center of a fertile farm and mining community. But
 eighty-five years ago, the newly developing city of Los Angeles, some two hundred miles
 away, built an aqueduct to divert the Owens River, which fed Owens Lake. The
 lake dried up, and the Owens Valley was stuck with the dust while the river
 water still flows to LA dirt cheap.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="663.309" endTime="672.088">
 This is environmental justice . It's just wrong for the people of the
 Owens Valley to have their health harmed so the people in Los Angeles can
 pay less for water.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="672.088" endTime="694.309">
 And so, Los Angeles is under intense pressure to put some of its water back
 into Owens Lake. One plan would divert up to fifteen percent of the city's
 water supply every year.
 That may be too much for the big city to swallow. But Los Angeles is
 offering to return some water which, along with gravel and vegetation
 planted on the lake bed, might control the dust.

 We are not agreeing to go up there and just throw money at it. We are
 willing to e- spend what it takes in effective measures to clean it up.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="703.604" endTime="718.33">
 But nobody's holding their breath, until the next dust storm, when the
 big city and the small town go at it again in one of the longest running water
 wars in the West. Jane Clayson, ABC News, Owens Valley, California.
