 A day where the investigation of the new allegations against President Clinton have taken some very interesting and startling turns. 
<time sec="72.731">
 Independent counsel Kenneth Starr's office is interviewing other members of Monica Lewinsky's White House intern class.
<time sec="79.139">
 So far, two have been contacted by the FBI. 
<time sec="82.701">
 Agents apparently want to learn if Lewinsky ever discussed a relationship with the President.
<time sec="87.109">
 The incident intruded into a White House photo opportunity today with Palestinian authority leader Yasser Arafat.
<time sec="92.935">
 The President is sticking fast to denials he ever had any improper relationship with Lewinsky.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Bill_Clinton" spkrtype="male" startTime="99.139" endTime="134.803">
 There are a lot of other questions that are I think very legitimate. You have a right to ask them. You and th- the American people have a right to- to get answers.
<time sec="106.119">
 We are working very hard to comply, get all the requests for informations up here.
<time sec="110.660">
 ah And e- we will give you as many answers as we can, as soon as we can, at the appropriate time, consistent with our obligation to also cooperate with the investigations. 
<time sec="120.425">
 And that's not a dodge, that's really what I've, what I've I've talked with our people.
<time sec="124.884">
 I want to do that.
<time sec="126.435">
 ah i- I'd like for you to have more rather than less, s- sooner rather than later. So we'll work through it as quickly as we can and get all those questions out there to you.

 Just moments ago, the President's close friend and adviser and attorney Vernon Jordan spoke with the media. 
<time sec="140.323">
 Jordan told reporters he helped Lewinsky look for work in the private sector, arranging interviews for her with American Express, Revlon, and Young and Rubicam, a New York PR firm. 
<time sec="149.996">
 Jordan also said he helped Lewinsky obtain legal counsel after she was subpoenaed. And he denied reports of an affair between the former White House intern and the President and of any cover up.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Vernon_Jordan" spkrtype="male" startTime="160.456" endTime="195.578">
 I want to say to you absolutely and unequivocally that Ms. melin- welinsk- Ms. Lewinsky told me in no uncertain terms that she did not have a sexual relationship with the President.
<time sec="184.048">
 At no time did I ever say, suggest or intimate to her that she should lie.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Chuck_Roberts" spkrtype="male" startTime="195.578" endTime="227.149">
 On yet another front, CNN has learned the independent counsel Kenneth Starr planned to have the young woman wear a recording device in order to tape record conversations between her, and the President, and Vernon Jordan. 
<time sec="207.435">
 Starr apparently hoped to record Jordan first and then, based on that result, decide whether to record the President.
<time sec="212.945">
 But CNN has learned the plan was abandoned when it became clear the investigation was going public.
<time sec="218.313">
 Starr made a brief appearance before a frenzied crowd of reporters and photographers outside his Washington office.
<time sec="224.313">
 He says the truth is out there.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Kenneth_Starr" spkrtype="male" startTime="227.149" endTime="261.749">
 Our job is to gather facts and to evaluate those facts and to get at the truth.
<time sec="233.599">
 I have a very strong belief in facts and in truth, and that the facts will come out and the truth will come out, eventually, again consis- consistent with the presumption of innocence.
<time sec="244.394">
 Let's, let's bear in mind that each individual in our country enjoys a presumption of innocence. I think that's very important in terms of fairness.
<time sec="252.639">
 That's why confidentiality, which is very hard to maintain now, but we're doing our very best to maintain confidentiality because of individual reputations.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Chuck_Roberts" spkrtype="male" startTime="261.749" endTime="339.721">
 Monica Lewinsky talked about her alleged relationship with the President in many conversations recorded with coworker, Linda Tripp. 
<time sec="268.782">
 Some of them were purportedly taped by Tripp wearing an FBI wire. 
<time sec="272.599">
 All this set up by Kenneth Starr. And Newsweek magazine reports Lewinsky said, and we quote,
<time sec="278.068">
 Maybe we should just tell the creep don't ever talk to me again, now you have this information, do whatever you want with it.
<time sec="284.109">
 And at the same time Lewinsky also declared, I have lied my entire life.
<time sec="288.782">
 CNN confirms the President admits having an affair with Gennifer Flowers, while he was Arkansas governor.
<time sec="294.149">
 Sources say the revelation came during his deposition last weekend in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case. 
<time sec="299.190">
 During the ninety-two campaign, the President flatly denied having an affair with Gennifer Flowers. 
<time sec="304.374">
 A majority of Americans believe the allegations against Mr. Clinton are true.
<time sec="308.986">
 In a new CNN USA Today Gallup poll, fifty-four percent of those surveyed believe he had an affair with Monica Lewinsky. 
<time sec="316.048">
 Thirty-seven percent don't believe it, forty-nine percent believe he lied under oath. Forty-three percent say the allegation is false. 
<time sec="323.048">
 Fifty-one percent do not believe the President tried to obstruct justice, thirty-nine percent say he did. 
<time sec="328.639">
 A majority of Americans surveyed believes allegations Mr. Clinton had an affair while he was President are not relevant.
<time sec="334.782">
 But most also believe allegations he lied under oath and obstructed justice are relevant.
