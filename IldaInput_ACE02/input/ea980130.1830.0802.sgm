 Tonight, we are going to take A Closer Look at something that really appears to bother many of you and, in some respects, bothers some of us, anonymous sources. Sources say is a phrase that's been around for the history of journalism.
<time sec="816.122">
 But during this challenge to the President, which has so many incendiary parts to it, the reporting from sources who wish to remain unidentified is at a pretty high level. First, here's ABC's John Cochran on the art of anonymity.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Sam_Donaldson" spkrtype="male" startTime="834.826" endTime="836.708">
 ABC News has learned from sources that
</turn>
<turn speaker="spkr_1" spkrtype="male" startTime="836.708" endTime="838.366">
 A highly placed source says those
</turn>
<turn speaker="spkr_2" spkrtype="female" startTime="838.366" endTime="840.877">
 We've been told that the President was calling friends today
</turn>
<turn speaker="spkr_3" spkrtype="male" startTime="840.877" endTime="844.065">
 As one senior aide told me this morning, it's a meltdown at the moment.
</turn>
<turn speaker="John_Cochran" spkrtype="male" startTime="844.065" endTime="859.331">
 Whoa, hold on. Who are all these unnamed people talking, these sources? What are sources? Who might a White House source be? Although it could be the President or the First Lady, that would be rare. But aides and friends are not shy about speaking, anonymously.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Dan_Rather" spkrtype="male" startTime="859.331" endTime="864.203">
 Friends of First Lady Hillary Clinton have told CBS News, quote She's in full battle mode.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Linda_Douglass" spkrtype="female" startTime="864.203" endTime="867.045">
 One described her as being in full battle regalia.
</turn>
<turn speaker="John_Cochran" spkrtype="male" startTime="867.045" endTime="894.091">
 In any White House, a senior source could be any of a dozen top aides who, in order to stay out of trouble, is willing to say more privately than in public. They usually talk to push the White House line. 
<time sec="877.968">
 Sometimes that gives reporters information or a lead they can use to get other information. But sometimes, according to former press secretary Marlin Fitzwater, leaking can be downright evil, such as trashing the President's opponents. Did Fitzwater ever do that himself?
</turn>
<turn speaker="Marlin_Fitzwater" spkrtype="male" startTime="894.091" endTime="897.917">
 Well, I did it a few times, much to my ah shame.
</turn>
<turn speaker="John_Cochran" spkrtype="male" startTime="897.917" endTime="900.923">
 Many leaks in this case have not come from the White House.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Phil_Jones" spkrtype="male" startTime="900.923" endTime="904.218">
 Two sources familiar with the independent counsel's investigation tell
</turn>
<turn speaker="John_Cochran" spkrtype="male" startTime="904.218" endTime="929.290">
 That phrase, sources familiar with the investigation, could mean several things. It could mean the independent counsel himself or someone on his staff, trying to put pressure on potential witnesses or just trying to impress the reporter with how much he knows. 
<time sec="918.014">
 It's the same with lawyers trying to help their clients. And reporters are willing to conceal a source's identity in return for information. Media critics say reporters should give you some clues.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Marvin_Kalb" spkrtype="male" startTime="929.290" endTime="936.923">
 Give some idea of where the person is coming from, whether that person has a very special agenda that he or she may be pushing.
</turn>
<turn speaker="John_Cochran" spkrtype="male" startTime="936.923" endTime="952.040">
 Information from unnamed sources is often accurate. Still, remember the warning The New York Times gives in this reporters handbook. The best source is the source that is identified by name. John Cochran, ABC News, the White House.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Peter_Jennings" spkrtype="male" startTime="952.040" endTime="976.576">
 Here, here. The most famous anonymous source in the modern history of political journalism was Deep Throat, the key source for the Washington Post during their reporting of Watergate and President Nixon's downfall. Ben Bradlee Ben Bradlee ran the Post then, and we talked to him in London today.
<time sec="970.234">
 You relied at a tremendous level on unnamed sources. Did you have to?
</turn>
<turn speaker="Ben_Bradlee" spkrtype="male" startTime="976.576" endTime="977.775">
 uh Yes, we did.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Peter_Jennings" spkrtype="male" startTime="977.775" endTime="978.397">
 Why?
</turn>
<turn speaker="Ben_Bradlee" spkrtype="male" startTime="978.397" endTime="1000.321">
 uh Because uh he would not allow us to name him and uh because uh we couldn't eh uh initially find anybody else. uh He steered us uh in various directions, and he called he called us back in what he thought were blind alleys, but uh uh we had to use him because he was what we had.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Peter_Jennings" spkrtype="male" startTime="1000.321" endTime="1002.984">
 What's the problem with unnamed sources?
</turn>
<turn speaker="Ben_Bradlee" spkrtype="male" startTime="1002.984" endTime="1041.616">
 The unnamed sources problem is simply this, they could take you for a ride, or they could certainly try to. But I don't think the public understands that uh everybody who talks to a journalist has an agenda. 
<time sec="1016.060">
 uh They don't talk to you out of the goodness of their hearts. They want to get a special message across. A good journalist, y- you know this, uh understands that, and therefore puts everything from that source through a special filter.
<time sec="1031.474">
 That is so as- uh elementary in our business that uh people talk to you for a reason, and that your first job as a reporter is to know that reason cold.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Peter_Jennings" spkrtype="male" startTime="1041.616" endTime="1049.897">
 Give us the Ben Bradlee lesson on what people should watch for most when they're reading you or watching us.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Ben_Bradlee" spkrtype="male" startTime="1049.897" endTime="1071.004">
 Well, when, w- uh if if the source is unidentified, take a minute to uh figure out, A, why the person won't talk, and that will add suspicion to what he says. Then figure out who uh uh has a s- uh a uh an interest in this particular version of the talk, and then see if you can't figure it out.
