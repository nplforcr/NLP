 But first we are breaking a story out of Pakistan today.
 US intelligence sources say the country is prime to test its nuclear
 capability.
 Here's a late update from Jamie McIntyre at the Pentagon.

<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="64.739" endTime="122.17">
 Having been caught flat footed by India's nuclear blast two weeks ago,
 the United States has been spending a lot of time monitoring what is going
 on in Pakistan.
 And now US intelligence sources tell CNN that Pakistan has taken all the
 steps it needs to in order to be ready to conduct a nuclear blast soon.
<time sec="84.781">
 Sources say that using US spy satellites and other means, the United
 States has determined that Pakistan is technically ready to conduct a test
 almost any time it wants.
 uh One US official said that if it was not ready now, it would be ready
 pretty soon.
 Of course, the United States has been lobbying Pakistan heavily not to go
 ahead with that test in response to India's nuclear test two weeks ago.
 uh This intelligence assessment means the diplomatic activity will increase as
 the United States continues to press the case.
 Jamie McIntyre, CNN, the Pentagon.
