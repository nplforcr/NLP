 In urban schools, teachers have low expectations of their students and the
 kids seldom exceed them.
 That's according to a report complied by education week newspaper.
 It shows students in urban schools scored lower in standardized tests than
 students in other areas.
 Only nineteen percent of the teachers surveyed said their students had skills
 required to do well in college.
 And forty percent said a high school diploma is no guarantee that a student has
 learned the basics.
