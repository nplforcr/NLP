 This weekend's big NASCAR race is the Goodies five hundred in Martinsville,
 Virginia.
 Which means quite simply that Goodies headache powder is the sponsor. At
 Goodies, they're very much looking forward to all of the commercial
 exposure that they will probably get this weekend.
 In fact, when you think about it, have you ever seen a NASCAR
 anything that wasn't plastered with somebody's advertising? ABC's Robert
 Krulwich tonight on selling at high speed.

<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1524.765" endTime="1529.513">
 Great crowd on hand. Glad to have you with us here for today's Goodies
 five hundred.

<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1529.513" endTime="1535.983">
 Once upon a time, stock cars were supposed to be just like the cars you
 would find in stock in any showroom.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1538.168" endTime="1547.286">
 But, your car does not have a seven hundred
 horsepower engine in it, and your car does not have writing on it here,
 here, here, here, here, or even here.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1547.286" endTime="1552.328">
 This is a billboard. This great big old race car is out there, and it's
 getting on television.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1552.328" endTime="1574.464">
 Which is why every available surface is covered with, There's Miller. There's
 Mobil. There's Valvoline, Ford, Bosch, Cummins, Goodyear on TV. Which
 brings us to a guy named Bob in Michigan. He is paid to watch TV tapes of
 every NASCAR race and keep track of every second a sponsor's logo appears
 on television.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1574.464" endTime="1578.925">
 So this sign here and this sign here and this sign here?
 Yes, as well as what's on the hood.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1580.269" endTime="1594.975">
 Bob's calculations are published in something called the sponsors report,
 which tells each sponsor the total time its logo was seen on TV during a
 race and compares the total to the cost of a television commercial in the
 same race.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1596.488" endTime="1622.748">
 For example, in this race, the report claims Valvoline got twenty eight
 minutes and seventeen seconds of exposure. That is worth over four hundred
 seventy five thousand dollars. And the
 fans? Well, they love the sponsors for supporting the sport. For example,
 watch this.
 I'm going to name a driver. What I'd like you to do is, in unison, tell me
 the product that they represent. The driver is Dale Earnhardt. What's his
 product?

<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1627.328" endTime="1634.639">
 Not only can these fans connect all the drivers with their products, if
 they
 like the driver, they will buy the product.

 I use Tide because they sponsor.

 That is Rusty Wallace in the car number two. The Miller Genuine Draft Ford
 Thunderbird.

<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1646.025" endTime="1651.864">
 But the true test for a driver is whether he has the stamina to survive the
 hat dance.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1656.128" endTime="1664.696">
 The winning driver owes every one of his sponsors a picture of
 the team wearing each sponsor's hat. So, forty sponsors, forty hats.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1664.696" endTime="1667.175">
 Everybody put your Goodies hat on!
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1667.175" endTime="1670.747">
 Even the hat man wants TV exposure. He has a hat.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1670.747" endTime="1671.545">
 Would you like to wear it?

<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1671.545" endTime="1672.595">
 No. I want you to

<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1672.595" endTime="1673.478">
 I don't wear hats.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1673.478" endTime="1688.94">
 All right, I'll wear it.
 All right. I will now wear Bill's hat on TV for nine and a half seconds.
 The Bill Brodrick hat, which will earn him how much in TV exposure? This
 much. Robert Krulwich, ABC News.
