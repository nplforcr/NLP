 A visit by British foreign secretary Robin Cook to the proposed
 site of an Israeli settlement in Jerusalem has drawn a harsh reaction from
 Israeli officials. More from the BBC's Barnaby Mason in Jerusalem.

 , the British foreign secretary was jostled by Israeli demonstrators
 shouting Robin Cook go home, and accusing him of anti-semitism.
 Despite this he succeeded in meeting local Palestinian representatives at
 the site.
 That provoked a formal protest from the Israeli government which
 regards the area as permanent Israeli territory.
 Mr. Netanyahu then canceled the dinner he was to have held with
 Mr. Cook, a notable snub not only to Britain but to the European
 Union, on whose behalf the foreign secretary is making his
 Middle East tour.
 Perhaps the most remarkable feature of the affair is the
 outspoken remarks made by British officials who preferred not to be
 identified.
 They described the cancellation of the dinner as a fantastic
 overreaction, asking whether a hand shake could be so dangerous.
