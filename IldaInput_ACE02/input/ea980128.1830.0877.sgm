 We're going to take a closer look tonight at a real predicament which has come up as a result of the President's problems. What are the consequences when members of the Secret Service
<time sec="885.111">
 are asked to testify against the persons they are supposed to protect? As we reported earlier, the independent counsel Kenneth Starr
<time sec="893.049">
 will soon do just that, issue subpoenas to one or more Secret Service agents assigned to the White House who might have information about the President
<time sec="901.947">
 and Monica Lewinsky. First, here's ABC's John McKenzie.
</turn>
<turn speaker="John_Mckenzie" spkrtype="male" startTime="906.458" endTime="930.049">
 They are often visible but rarely heard. They're the ones with the ear pieces and the walkie-talkies at the President's sleeve.
<time sec="914.723">
 Secret Service agents are with him virtually everywhere he goes, not only at these public rallies, but in the privacy of his car or outside his office. They are the President's shadow,
<time sec="926.233">
 and whatever they see and hear is supposed to be confidential.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Tim_McIntyre" spkrtype="male" startTime="930.049" endTime="937.927">
 You can't accomplish your job well unless you convince him that his uh his activities will be treated with confidence.
</turn>
<turn speaker="John_Mckenzie" spkrtype="male" startTime="937.927" endTime="966.662">
 Secret Service agents have testified before. During the Watergate investigation, agents answered questions about President Nixon's taping system. Agents also testified after the assassination attempt on Gerald Ford
<time sec="949.947">
 and, six years later, on the shooting of Ronald Reagan. But it was never about a president's private behavior.
<time sec="956.560">
 Recently, a few agents volunteered to talk about life in the Kennedy White House, but only because they thought they were being asked to stand by while laws on prostitution were being violated.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Lawrence_Newman" spkrtype="male" startTime="966.662" endTime="978.804">
 It was the most elite assignment in the Secret Service. And uh you were there watching an elevator or a door because uh the President was inside with with two hookers.
</turn>
<turn speaker="John_Mckenzie" spkrtype="male" startTime="978.804" endTime="1003.029">
 Fellow agents were outraged by the disclosures. The director of the Secret Service, Lewis Merletti, issued a stern reminder to all three thousand agents.
<time sec="986.682">
 Any aspect of the personal lives of our protectees has a negative impact.
<time sec="991.600">
 This is a confidence that should continue forever.
<time sec="994.845">
 But some now worry that confidence could be severely strained if agents are subpoenaed to testify about President Clinton and his personal life.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Hamilton_Brown" spkrtype="male" startTime="1003.029" endTime="1011.825">
 We don't want to be politicized. We don't want to be caught in the middle of a political football. And we would prefer to be left alone to do our jobs.
</turn>
<turn speaker="John_Mckenzie" spkrtype="male" startTime="1011.825" endTime="1022.172">
 Secret Service agents already complain that it's difficult to protect presidents. If now forced to testify about the President's personal behavior, 
<time sec="1019.682">
 they fear he would push them even farther away.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Hamilton_Brown" spkrtype="male" startTime="1022.172" endTime="1034.355">
 If we are are put into the th- the position where we're
<time sec="1026.104">
 we're forced back from the President because he doesn't trust us, then we're putting the President's life in jeopardy. And that is not our mission.
</turn>
<turn speaker="John_Mckenzie" spkrtype="male" startTime="1034.355" endTime="1045.437">
 Few doubt that, if subpoenaed, the agents will testify. The question is whether a president has the legal authority to stop them.
<time sec="1042.363">
 John McKenzie, ABC News, New York.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Peter_Jennings" spkrtype="male" startTime="1045.437" endTime="1069.151">
 So this is a difficult question whether Secret Service agents should be obliged to testify in a criminal case.
<time sec="1050.600">
 Joining us is Ronald Noble, professor of law at New York University. Professor Noble, who used to be the Treasury Department official who supervised the Secret Service during
<time sec="1059.274">
 at least one part of the Clinton administration.
<time sec="1061.498">
 First of all, your thoughts on how difficult it would be for their relationship with the President if they were obliged to testify?
</turn>
<turn speaker="Ron_Noble" spkrtype="male" startTime="1069.151" endTime="1087.090">
 I think it would undermine their relationship with the President. They're required to maintain his confidence. They're required to protect him. In order for them to do that, he has to trust them. 
<time sec="1078.335">
 If they're going to disclose confidences that they might have overheard or witnessed, he's not going to be able to trust them. But not just this president, every president and every visiting head of state as well.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Peter_Jennings" spkrtype="male" startTime="1087.090" endTime="1092.519">
 Now, you just heard one Secret Service official say it is a confidence that should continue forever. Do you really believe that?
</turn>
<turn speaker="Ron_Noble" spkrtype="male" startTime="1092.519" endTime="1109.886">
 I really believe it, Peter. I really believe it. I've talked to these agents. I've gone to funerals of these agents. I can tell you that they care deeply about their job, and they care deeply about the mission of the Secret Service. 
<time sec="1103.131">
 And if they're required to be people telling confidences of the president, I think that confidence and that relationship is going to be undermined
 immeasurably.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Peter_Jennings" spkrtype="male" startTime="1109.233" endTime="1120.825">
 Let
 me take up the other side, though, because it came up with the Secret Service agents looking after John F Kennedy.
<time sec="1115.009">
 They are law enforcement officers. What if they are witness or become aware that the law has been broken?
</turn>
<turn speaker="Ron_Noble" spkrtype="male" startTime="1120.825" endTime="1132.458">
 If they are witnesses to criminal activity, then they have an obligation to report criminal activity.
<time sec="1125.927">
 We're not talking here about the allegations that they're witnesses to criminal activity. We're talking about allegations that they're witnesses to private conduct.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Peter_Jennings" spkrtype="male" startTime="1132.458" endTime="1144.866">
 But that is less the issue when, for example, they might know, at the moment, this is all hypothetical. They might know
<time sec="1138.519">
 that the President has committed perjury by denying a relationship with Monica Lewinsky. They might know that not to be the case. What should they do?
</turn>
<turn speaker="Ron_Noble" spkrtype="male" startTime="1144.866" endTime="1168.111">
 Yeah, but what we're talking about here is speculation. I mean, if we follow this to its logical conclusion,
<time sec="1149.315">
 the independent counsel should be able to subpoena every Secret Service agent who's ever protected the president at any point in time to see whether they heard or didn't hear or saw or didn't see something. And I think it would just be a farce,
<time sec="1159.192">
 and it's something that we should stop. I think someone's got to draw the line and say we are not going to try to take
<time sec="1163.682">
 down the institution of the Secret Service 
<time sec="1165.376">
 just simply to see whether or not we have an additional fact witness.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Peter_Jennings" spkrtype="male" startTime="1168.111" endTime="1169.743">
 Professor Noble, thanks for your point of view.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Ron_Noble" spkrtype="male" startTime="1169.743" endTime="1170.304">
 Thank
 you.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Peter_Jennings" spkrtype="male" startTime="1170.049" endTime="1174.733">
 Professor
 Noble, professor at New York University.
<time sec="1172.264">
