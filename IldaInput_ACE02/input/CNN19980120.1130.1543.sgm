 I think it's two things.
 One, it's Leonardo DiCaprio.
 He's really cute if you're about sixteen years old, and they all saw him in
 Romeo and Juliet and got a big crush and they're going to go back and back

 But two, you've got a big sweeping love story, and boy, when you're a
 teenage girl there's nothing better.

 The focus of these two characters is is what the audience is into for the

 what develops between these two people.
