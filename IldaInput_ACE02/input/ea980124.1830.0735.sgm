 More on the widening crisis at the White House, specifically its impact on the vice president. Al Gore and Bill Clinton are good friends, but in this crisis 
<time sec="743.218">
 they may very well find themselves on different sides of the fence. As we reported at least one Democrat is already talking about an early Gore presidency,
<time sec="751.871">
 as ABC's Karla Davis reports.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Karla_Davis" spkrtype="female" startTime="754.790" endTime="776.422">
 There was no press access to the Vice President when he arrived at the White House late this afternoon. And Mr. Gore said nothing about the latest scandal in his public speeches this week. But his demeanor at a White House photo-op with the President on Thursday said enough.
<time sec="770.708">
 Fallout from the latest allegations about the President is hitting the second in command as well.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Stuart_Rothenberg" spkrtype="male" startTime="776.422" endTime="785.014">
 It does not do the Democratic party any good, it certainly doesn't do the vice president any good. 
<time sec="782.035">
 And anything that hurts the President hurts his number two.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Karla_Davis" spkrtype="female" startTime="785.014" endTime="791.239">
 Inside the Beltway, advice to Gore is to remain loyal to his long time friend and political partner.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Kiki_Moore" spkrtype="female" startTime="791.239" endTime="798.545">
 Well he's not distancing himself from the President. And there's no reason to. And nor should he from a b- b- 
<time sec="796.157">
 blatantly political point of view. He shouldn't. 
</turn>
<turn speaker="Karla_Davis" spkrtype="female" startTime="798.545" endTime="823.688">
 Gore told a group of newspaper columnists this week quote the President has denied the charges, and I believe it.
<time sec="805.851">
 Otherwise, Mr. Gore has not gone out of his way to comment on this scandal. His schedule is unchanged, including a dinner here tonight at his residence
<time sec="815.198">
 with House minority leader and one time Clinton opponent, Richard Gephardt. Karla Davis, ABC News, Washington.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Forrest_Sawyer" spkrtype="male" startTime="823.688" endTime="838.504">
 This current crisis has turned into a defining moment for the President. More and more, his critics are calling on Mr. Clinton to say exactly what he means, 
<time sec="833.239">
 and to mean exactly what he says. Here's ABC's Michel McQueen.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Jim_Lehrer" spkrtype="male" startTime="838.504" endTime="840.382">
 Mr. President, welcome. 
</turn>
<turn speaker="Michel_Mcqueen" spkrtype="female" startTime="840.382" endTime="847.586">
 Adding fuel to the President's current crisis is the kind of artful dodging over a simple question that has long enraged his critics.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Jim_Lehrer" spkrtype="male" startTime="847.586" endTime="851.463">
 No improper relationship. Define what you mean by that.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Bill_Clinton" spkrtype="male" startTime="851.463" endTime="860.484">
 Well, I think you know what it means. It means that uh that there is not a a sexual relationship, an improper sexual relationship or any other a- kind of improper relationship.
</turn>
<turn speaker="spkr_8" spkrtype="male" startTime="860.484" endTime="862.096">
 He's so quick. He's so glib. 
</turn>
<turn speaker="spkr_9" spkrtype="male" startTime="862.096" endTime="873.892">
 oh I mean, that's why they call him Slick Willy. I mean,
<time sec="864.137">
 w- w- an- they asked him about about the Gennifer Flowers incident, I mean, his his re- his response was no, it's not true. And I guess he was referring to the fact that maybe it wasn't twelve years, maybe it was eleven years.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Michel_Mcqueen" spkrtype="female" startTime="873.892" endTime="886.096">
 And according to sources who have heard the tapes of Monica Lewinsky's phone conversations,
<time sec="877.749">
 the President's denial of the affair may hinge on his belief,
<time sec="880.831">
 allegedly described by her in the tapes, that oral sex does not constitute adultery.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Bill_Clinton" spkrtype="male" startTime="886.096" endTime="887.443">
 I have no memory of that.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Michel_Mcqueen" spkrtype="female" startTime="887.443" endTime="895.419">
 It is part of a pattern of nuanced responses to everyday moral dilemmas that has characterized Mr. Clinton's career.
<time sec="893.831">
 From questions about drug use
</turn>
<turn speaker="Bill_Clinton" spkrtype="male" startTime="895.419" endTime="908.055">
 The answer to that question is I've never broken the state law. 
<time sec="898.402">
 And that when I was in England, I experimented with marijuana a time or two, and I didn't like it, 
<time sec="905.198">
 and didn't inhale, and never tried it again.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Michel_Mcqueen" spkrtype="female" startTime="908.055" endTime="910.361">
 To decisions about military service.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Bill_Clinton" spkrtype="male" startTime="910.361" endTime="913.341">
 I did not dodge the draft. I did not do anything wrong.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Elizabeth_Drew" spkrtype="female" startTime="913.341" endTime="923.850">
 Whenever there are press conferences, you're left with a little sort of funny feeling that he wasn't leveling, he
<time sec="921.504">
 he was fudging over something.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Michel_Mcqueen" spkrtype="female" startTime="923.850" endTime="933.218">
 And remarkable to some, although the pattern has held throughout his presidency, Mr. Clinton has not only survived but thrived. A tribute to his political skill.
</turn>
<turn speaker="spkr_14" spkrtype="male" startTime="933.218" endTime="935.463">
 I didn't smoke up. 
</turn>
<turn speaker="Michel_Mcqueen" spkrtype="female" startTime="935.463" endTime="949.667">
 And very likely in part because many of his generation have engaged in the same kinds of rationalizations about drugs and sex.
<time sec="942.218">
 Including for example, Virginia Senator Chuck Robb,
<time sec="944.851">
 who when accused of infidelity also said he had not quote slept with the other woman.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Debra_Haffner" spkrtype="female" startTime="949.667" endTime="960.810">
 For many people, sex is intercourse. um There's this high school mentality that
<time sec="954.749">
 people my age and Bill Clinton's age grew up with, which was that you could do everything but, and it didn't count.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Michel_Mcqueen" spkrtype="female" startTime="960.810" endTime="972.137">
 But Mr. Clinton seems to take the evasions a step further than other politicians. If the story continues, it will be the ultimate test 
<time sec="967.586">
 of his verbal gymnastics. Michel McQueen, ABC News, the White House.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Forrest_Sawyer" spkrtype="male" startTime="972.137" endTime="984.606">
 We will have more on the crisis tomorrow morning on This Week with Sam and Cokie, White House reaction to the crisis from one of President Clinton's closest advisors, Paul Begala. Plus the lawyer representing Monica Lewinsky, William Ginsburg.
