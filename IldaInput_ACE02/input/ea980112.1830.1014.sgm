 So since it is such a mess in Asia, the question is what can the United States do to fix it, if anything. The International Monetary Fund wants to provide a one hundred billion dollar bailout. And the IMF is asking the United States for about nineteen billion dollars to replenish its funds. Many members of Congress do not want to ante up. ABC's Cokie Roberts joins us from Capitol Hill tonight. Cokie, good evening.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Cokie_Roberts" spkrtype="female" startTime="1037.590" endTime="1038.387">
 Good evening, Peter.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Peter_Jennings" spkrtype="male" startTime="1038.387" endTime="1046.206">
 This is an interesting coalition that the uh opponents have put together between conservatives and liberals. How did it come together and why?
</turn>
<turn speaker="Cokie_Roberts" spkrtype="female" startTime="1046.206" endTime="1075.510">
 Well, we've seen that kind of coalition before on some foreign policy matters. And what you have is conservatives who don't want to spend that much money and also don't want to give President Clinton the win if he asks for this. And you have liberals who say why should be we bailing out big banks? Those aren't our people, and there're problems here at home, why should web- we be helping Asia? So you get those two groups together, and then the President finds himself having to go vote by vote by vote trying to put together the bailout
 package.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Peter_Jennings" spkrtype="male" startTime="1074.805" endTime="1081.190">
 And i- is it a
 coalition do you think can hang together, or is the President likely to have his way as he did ultimately with Mexico?
</turn>
<turn speaker="Cokie_Roberts" spkrtype="female" startTime="1081.190" endTime="1107.988">
 Well, you've got uh you've got members of Congress heading for Asia now. There'll be lots of hearings at the beginning when Congress comes back into session, and uh they will try to educate people about these things. But uh I think the President will probably eventually get it because of the concern about American companies like we've just seen. But uh he's might have to give up some other big ticket items for that, Peter, like special trading authority and uh the UN dues payments.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Peter_Jennings" spkrtype="male" startTime="1107.988" endTime="1138.994">
 Okay, Cokie, thank you very much. Cokie Roberts on Capitol Hill tonight. As said, there's a very serious debate already about whether a bailout will work. The argument goes if they manage to blow it on their own, why should the United States give them more money to make it even bigger, the mess, that is. Joining us this evening is Todd Buchholz, an expert on the market and a former economic advisor to President Bush. Todd, the argument, as I understand it, goes this way. You bail out these economies. The American taxpayer basically helps countries that will not reform themselves. What's the counter argument?
</turn>
<turn speaker="Todd_Buchholz" spkrtype="male" startTime="1138.994" endTime="1161.549">
 Well, Peter, it's a little bit like paying protection money to the Mob. If you're a shopkeeper, you feel awful about doing it, but you wonder whether you'll feel worse if you don't. uh The US government and the IMF uh are effectively making out checks to these east Asian governments because we want to keep their financial and stock market problems far away from our own.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Peter_Jennings" spkrtype="male" startTime="1161.549" endTime="1170.180">
 Now, the same argument goes that the United States is going to help out American banks who have made unwise, risky investments and that if you do so, they won't be discouraged from doing it again.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Todd_Buchholz" spkrtype="male" startTime="1170.180" endTime="1199.639">
 Well, and I think that argument has a lot to it. uh In fact, if these governments permitted bankruptcies, if even American investors who bought uh who bought bonds or stocks in those companies suffered losses, they would think twice and realize that this market, any market, any legitimate market, that is, has ups and has downs, and it's not all about profits. There are losses, and we must keep the system honest, and that means permitting some bankruptcies.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Peter_Jennings" spkrtype="male" startTime="1199.639" endTime="1206.153">
 Okay, Todd Buchholz, thanks very much. An argument that will continue in the next several days. We'll have more news from today in just a moment.
