 Ever since the country learned as much as it did about
 President Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky, the crucial
 questions
 were, what did they do together, if anything, and what did he ask her to
 say
 about their relationship, if anything? And has the President told the
 country the truth or broken the law?
 From the beginning, Miss Lewinsky's attorney has insisted she would
 certainly not talk to a grand jury unless she were given immunity from
 prosecution. ABC News has now learned that her lawyer has lost an
 important battle. We go to Washington and ABC's Jackie Judd.

 For weeks, the case involving Monica Lewinsky and President Clinton has
 been
 in virtual limbo while the judge considered what the ground rules would be
 for Lewinsky's testimony. Her lawyer, William Ginsburg, had gone to
 federal
 court arguing that Kenneth Starr had reneged on a deal to shield Lewinsky
 completely from prosecution in exchange for her cooperation.
 Sources say Lewinsky was prepared to admit that she did have a
 sexual relationship with the President, but not that he encouraged her to
 lie about it under oath. Now, lawyers familiar with the investigation have
 told ABC News that Judge Norma Johnson has ruled against Ginsburg. There
 was no deal. Ginsburg and prosecutors declined comment.
 Starr now has several options. He could force Lewinsky to appear
 before the grand jury with limited immunity. That would still give him the
 ability to prosecute her based on evidence provided by others. Or Starr
 could bypass the grand jury altogether and indict her as a means of
 presenting evidence involving the President.
 Lewinsky has an option, as well. If she is brought before the grand
 jury, she could refuse to testify, although that could land her in jail for
 contempt.
 It's high stakes for the central character in this scandal. And the next
 move is up to Starr. Peter?

 Jackie, if I understand it correctly, a grand jury in Arkansas today heard
 the testimony that Mrs. Clinton gave on videotape on Saturday. Current
 questions or old questions?
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="187.980" endTime="207.925">
 Old questions. No Lewinsky-related questions. Questions relating to the
 mid eighties when she was a lawyer, when Mr. Clinton was the governor of
 Arkansas. Her lawyer said today Mrs. Clinton refused to answer two
 questions about conversations she'd had with her husband, the President,
 citing spousal privilege. That is, a husband and wife cannot be compelled
 to testify against each other.

 Okay, many thanks. Jackie Judd in Washington.
