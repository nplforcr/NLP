1. Introduction

This file contains documentation on the ACE 2005 Multilingual Training
Corpus, Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) catalog number LDC2006T06 and isbn
1-58563-376-3.

This publication contains the complete set of English, Arabic and Chinese
training data for the 2005 Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) technology
evaluation. The corpus consists of data of various types annotated for
entities, relations and events was created by Linguistic Data Consortium
with support from the ACE Program, with additional assistance from
LDC. This data was previously distributed as an e-corpus (LDC2005E18) to
participants in the 2005 ACE evaluation.

The objective of the ACE program is to develop automatic content extraction
technology to support automatic processing of human language in text
form. 

In November 2005, sites were evaluated on system performance in five
primary areas: the recognition of entities, values, temporal expressions,
relations, and events.  Entity, relation and event mention detection were
also offered as diagnostic tasks.  All tasks with the exception of event
tasks were performed for three languages, English, Chinese and Arabic.
Events tasks were evaluated in English and Chinese only.  The current
publication comprises the official training data for these evaluation
tasks.

A complete description of the ACE 2005 Evaluation can be found on the ACE
Program website maintained by the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST): http://www.nist.gov/speech/tests/ace/

2. Annotation
2.1 Tasks and Guidelines
Data contained in this release has been annotated for the following tasks:

  - Entities
  - Values (including TIMEX2 objects)
  - Relations between entities, including relation timestamps
  - Events, including event timestamps
  - TIMEX2 normalization for English data

The latest annotation guidelines for each language can be downloaded from
LDC's ACE website:
  http://projects.ldc.upenn.edu/ace/annotation

2.2 Annotation Process

Training data files for all languages are dually annotated for all tasks by
two annotators working independently.  The first pass (complete) annotation
is called 1P; the independent dual first pass (complete) annotation is
called DUAL.  For both 1P and DUAL, a single annotator completes all tasks
(entities, values, relations & events) for a file.  Files are assigned via
an automated Annotation Workflow System (AWS), and file assignment is
double-blind.

Discrepancies between the 1P and DUAL version of each file are then
adjudicated by a senior annotator or team leader, resulting in a
high-quality gold standard file.  The gold standard adjudicated file is
known as ADJ.  After adjudication, TIMEX2 values are normalized for English
only.  This task is known as NORM.  

Note that this annotation process differs substantially from previous years
in which data was first passed (1P) by a single junior annotator, then that
person's work was second passed (2P), or reviewed for completeness and
accuracy, by a senior annotator; and then additional quality control (QC)
spot-checks were conducted by the team leader.  This annotation process
should result in a final corpus of ADJ data that is higher quality and more
consistent than in previous ACE corpora.  Note however that due to time and
funding constraints, most but not all files have been adjudicated or indeed
dually annotated. The corpus also includes additional quality control
checks conducted by team leaders on the ADJ files.

The full annotation process for 2005 is represented below:

1P: entities	    DUAL: entities
    values                values
    events                events
    relations             relations

3. Source Data Profile
3.1 Data Selection Process

A new feature of 2005 ACE training corpus is careful, targeted data
selection.  Rather than choosing files at random for annotation, this
year's task requires a certain density of annotation across the corpus.
The established target, agreed upon at the Fall 2004 ACE Workshop, is 50
examples of each entity, relation and event type/subtype within the
training corpus for each language.  Note that the "50-example threshhold"
is simply a target and not a hard and fast requirement of the corpus.  LDC
has made a concerted effort to identify at least 50 examples of each
type/subtype, but has likely fallen short of the goal in some cases.  What
follows is a brief description of our data selection process.

First, a pool of documents substantially larger than the target dataset
was quickly labeled by ACE annotators as "good" or "bad" for ACE annotation.  
The good/bad determiniation was based on the document content including 
number and type of entities, relations and events. Annotators then reviewed 
the "good" documents and produced a rough estimate of the number of each 
type/subtype of entity, relation and event mentioned in the document.  In 
practice for most genres this involved a binary yes/no distinction of 
whether a given subtype appeared in each document. Documents were then
algorithmically selected from this set to maximize the overall count of
each type/subtype. This process was supplemented by manual keyword 
searching focused on the rarest annotation types.

3.2 Training Data Sources and Epochs

Below is a description of the data sources and epochs for each language,
along with a rough percentage of each data type to be expected in the
complete (final) training corpus.  Some of the source data is drawn from
previous LDC publications including TDT4 Multilingual Text and Annotations

5. Data Directory Structure

The data are organized by language, data type and annotation status as
follows: 

fp1: data subject to first pass (complete) annotation
fp2: data also subject to dual first pass (complete) annotation
adj: data also subject to discrepancy resolution/adjudication
timex2norm: data also subject to TIMEX2 normalization

So for instance, if a source file has been dually annotated, you will find
an .apf.xml annotation file in each of "fp1" and "fp2".

The "FileList" files contain information about the word (for English and
Arabic) or character (for Chinese) counts and annotation status for each
file in the release.

6. File Format Description

   Each directory contains files of the following formats.  For most
   users, the most important files are the .sgm files and .apf.xml
   files.

   Source Text (.sgm) Files

      - These files contain the source text files in an SGM format.
	These files use the UNIX-style end of lines.  All .sgm files are
	in UTF-8.

   ACE Program Format (APF) (.apf.xml) Files

      - These files are in the official ACE annotation file format.  See
        section 8 for more details.

   AG (.ag.xml) Files

      - These are annotation files created with the LDC's annotation
        toolkit.  These files have been convetered to the corresponding
        .apf.xml files.

   ID table (.tab) Files

      - These files store mapping tables between the IDs used in the
        ag.xml files and their corresponding apf.xml files.


7. Data Validation

Below is a description of the sanity checks and other format validation
steps applied to annotation files created by LDC.  (Note that files created
by Valorem have had only two sanity checks applied: validation of .xml, and
self-scoring using NIST's ACE scorer, ace05-eval-v11.pl.)

    -- Extents stripped of all spaces and punctuation at front and back
    -- GPE mentions without roles were fixed
    -- For non-GPE mentions with roles, roles were removed
    -- All non-complex entity mentions have heads.  For APF, this means
       that all entity mentions have heads
    -- No English passages are annotated in non-English files
    -- All relation mentions have exactly two non-timex2 arguments
    -- All relation arguments are contained in the extent of the 
       relation mention
    -- All event mention arguments are contained in the extent of the
       event mention
    -- All NAMPRE and NOMPRE GPE mentions have GPE as their role
    -- No relations have mentions from the same entity as their only
       non-timex2 arguments
    -- All files have exactly one timex2 annotation in the DATETIME field
    -- No annotation extents overlap without nesting (entity mention, 
       relation mention, event mention, value mention, entity mention head, 
       event mention anchor)
    -- There are no annotations inside of sgm tags
    -- There are no instances where an entity and an event share exactly 
       the same head/anchor
    -- All relation arguments have types that are allowed for their 
       argument position based on their entity/value type
    -- All event arguments have types that are allowed for their
       role based on their entity/value type
    -- All entities, values, relations, events have permissible type-subtype 
       pairs
    -- All files successfully convert to APF
    -- All APF files validate against DTD
    -- All APF files can be scored against themselves
    -- All instances of cross-type metonymy manually reviewed
    -- All instances of co-extensive entity mentions with the same heads
       manually reviewed
    -- Check for event mentions whose anchor is the full extent of the
       mention
    -- Manual scan of all PRO extents for outliers in adjudicated files
    -- Manual scan of all NOM heads with different entity type/subtype
       values in different parts of the corpus (adjudicated files only)
    -- Manual scan of all NAM heads with different entity type/subtype
       values in different parts of the corpus (adjudicated files only)
    -- Manual scan of all relation mentions by relation type/subtype
       and argument type/subtype for outliers in adjudicated files
    -- Manual and automatic scans of mention extents by patterns to identify
       inconsistencies in adjudicated files
    -- Search for untagged pronouns (English, Arabic)
    -- Search for English Building-Grounds mentions containing "Airport" or
       "Airfield"
    -- Search for untagged relative clauses (English)
    -- Search for demonstratives tagged as WHQ (Arabic)
    -- Search for relation arguments in violation of the Blocking Rule as
       defined in the annotation guidelines
    -- Search for non-Verbal, non-Other, co-extensive relation mentions
    -- Search for relations with frequently-confused types based on argument
       types (in particular, PHYS.Located vs. ART.UOIM and ORG-AFF.Employment
       vs. GPE-AFF.CRRE)
    -- Search for co-extensive, co-related event mentions
    -- Scan entities whose mentions appear more than once in the argument 
       structure of a single event mention.
    -- Scan all clitic pronoun mentions that are not participants in the
       event whose anchor they are attached to (Arabic)
    -- Scan all unannotated common TIMEX2 triggers (English)
    -- Manually examine and correct or describe all fatal errors and warnings
       generated by the most recent version of the scorer

8. Notes About Scorer Warnings

The current version of the ACE scorer (v11) still generates warnings for a
handful of the files included in this distribution for both Chinese and 
English. The LDC has manually reviewed these annotations and determined
that the annotation is as correct as possible given this year's annotation
guidelines. The warnings the remain are as follows:

English
    Warning: "appear to be redundant mentions"
    Description: Two mentions of the same event in the same extent may 
        have access to the same arguments by the Typeable

9. Notes About APF

   - Offsets

     APF uses the offset counting method traditionally used in previous
     ACE evaluation programs: 1) Each (UTF-8) character, not byte, is
     counted as one.  2) Each newline character is counted as one.  (The
     .sgm files use the UNIX-style end of line characters.)  3) SGML
     tags are *not* counted towards offsets.  (Please note that the AG
     files included in this release do count SGML tags in offsets.)

   - TIMEX2 (new this year)

     The timex2 element represents TIME2 timex expression annotations.
     Its optional attributes, such as "VAL" and "MOD", represent the
     TIMEX2 normalization values.  Note that LDC is creating timex2
     annotation on all files, but not performing timex2 normalization of
     all of the files.

     Timestamping in relations and events are represented as references
     to timex2 annotations in relation_arguments and event_arguments (and
     as references to timex2_mention annotations in
     relation_mention_arguments and event_mention_arguments).  These
     timestamp arguments have roles that start with "Time-".

   - Extent and Scope in Event Mentions (new this year)

     In response to requests made at the 2005 mid-course correction
     workshop, the extent of an event_mention is now an automatically
     generated minimum string that includes its anchor and its
     event_mention_arguments.  The "ldc_scope" element stores the scope
     marked in the LDC's annotation process.

   - REFID (new this year)

     The REFID attributes used in relation_argument and event_argument
     refer to entity, value or timex2 IDs.  The REFID attributes used in
     relation_mention_argument and event_mention_argument refer to
     entity_mention, value_mention or timex2_mention IDs.

   - TYPE, LDCTYPE and LDCATR in entity_mention

     The TYPE attribute of entity_mention store the official ACE entity
     mention types, and the LDCTYPE and LDCATR attributes store the
     attributes used in the LDC's annotation process.

   - "Unspecified" TENSE for "Other" MODALITY in relations (new this year)
 
     If the MODALITY attribute of a relation is set to "Other", the
     TENSE attribute is automatically set to "Unspecified".  This is not
     true for events.

   - name in entity_attributes

     The "name" element in entity_attributes stores the heads of
     "NAM"-type mentions as in the previous years.  In response to
     George Doddington's request, we have added the NAME attribute to
     the "name" element.  The NAME attribute stores slightly normalized
     versions of the names where:

     - \n is replaced with a space
     - multiple spaces are reduced to one space
     - " (double quote) is removed

     - Example:

     <entity_attributes>
        <name NAME="United States">
           <charseq START="4242" END="4254">United
     States</charseq>
        </name>
     </entity_attributes>

   - Nickname metonymy

     Nickname metonyms are indicated with METONYMY_MENTION="TRUE" in
     entity_mentions.  "NAN"-type entity mentions marked as nickname
     metonymy do not give rise to name elements.

   - Cross-type metonymy

     "Cross-type" metonyms are represented with relations of the type
     METONYMY.  The METONYMY type relations do not have
     relation_mentions.
