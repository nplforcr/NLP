<SUBJECT> Degradation of nuclear weapons </SUBJECT>

Suppose somebody has a nuclear fission weapon, how long would it take
before the weapon starts to degrade because radioactive isotopes decay.

When would you reach the point where the weapon doesn't work any longer
because it has lost its critical mass. Could this occur within a few
years time or would it require several thousand years? In all
computations you've to assume that the nuclear core including its
harnass don't lose their structural integrity.

Also, we are not talking about degradation of chemical or electronic
components in the high explosive shell that surrounds the nuclear core.
Actually, I suspect that these parts will degrade first.

This depends on the weapon type used.

Plutonium 239 decays to U-235 (with much bigger critical mass) with
half-life of 24 000 years. This is accompanied by buildup of helium.
That would cause expansion of core. Granted, He-4 is not a neutron
poison and may actually improve the criticality by moderating neutrons,
but moderated-critical assembly is much slower and therefore explodes
at low yield.
Pu weapons also have to rely on implosion and well-timed neutron
injection at the right moment because they have high neutron
background. Of the principal neutron sources, Pu-238 decays with
half-life of 87 years, Pu-240 with 6400 years and Pu-242 lasts hundreds
of thousands of years.

The artificial neutron injection devices may rely on alpha-n reactions
with alpha emitters of various half-life or on accelerators dependent
on tritium whose half-life is 12 years.

Uranium-235, by contrast, has a half-life of 700 millions years,
leading to inert Pb-207. As HEU has a low neutron bacground, it is
possible to make designs that have low insertion speeds, so that in
case of predetonation, they have low fizzle yields (in the order of a
comparable mass of chemical explosive) but if there is no
predetonation, they stay in highly critical shape despite failure of
neutron initiation until a spontaneous fission does initiate a
high-yield explosion.

Tritium has a half-life of around 14 years. That will make a difference
on time scales of a few years. Plutonium has a half-life of 24,000 years.
You won't have to worry about that.

I don't know whether the chemical explosives decay significantly.

This is fine for weapons in the 20 KT class.

If however you are thinking of larger weapons, your design will
use tritium which as a very short half life (7 years IIRC).

So basicly you need to resupply the tritium at about 1-2 year
intervals.

Even if you keep with low yield weapons, your life is not
limited by the radioactive halflife of the fissioning material.
rather it is limited by the slow chemical
decomposition/degradation of the explosives. Explosives over 50
years old are downright unsafe and unreliable. Erratic
explosives can make the difference between a nuclear yield of 1
ton vs 20 kiloton.

A few kiloton weapon that could fit in a suitcase is a dangerous toy on
the black market. Quite likely the design would be Pu based with an
implosion mechanism. But from all that I read the critical parts are
then the neutron generator based on tritium and the core itself. This
means that suitcase A-weapons are probably not anymore functional since
they were produced in the former USSR. (Some of them were apparently
lost, whether this is real is another story). It also means that anyone
who possesses nuclear weapons should have the tools to upgrade the
weapon. Otherwise you soon end up with a useless weapon that could still
be used as a dirty bomb.

Some unexploded shells found at the site of the Battle of Verdun (The
Great War) are still potent enough to kill. They have be exploded by
experts.

There are still UXB (unexploded bombs) found from WW2 in England and
Germany. They still are capable of exploding.

Landmines are forever, it would seem. There are landminde from WW2 that
still kill and maim.

Point is that Pu based nuclear weapons rely on a very well timed
chemical explosion to create a symmetric implosion of the nuclear core.
Any defect in the chemical would cause an asymmetric situation and the
weapon will simply not work.
