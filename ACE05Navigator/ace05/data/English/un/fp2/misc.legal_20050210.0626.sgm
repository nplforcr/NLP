<SUBJECT> GOOGLE TO BE SUED by 2 Australians </SUBJECT>

Two Australians, Lionel Lauer and Douglas MacDonald, have announced
their intentions to sue Google because they were flamed (insulted) in
Usenet newsgroups. MacDonald made the official announcement in a
photography newsgroup, and Lauer agreed to join him in the suit later
in the thread.

Do you think they have a shot??

Google only collates information. It has no emotions; just a 'bot'
forwarding people's thoughts and connecting them...

...but the case might be interesting...

probably, which is unfortunate.

Its like someone you dont know insulting you in a crowded shopping center
and then you taking the shopping center to court for 'allowing anonymous
and defamatory speech to occur within their facilities'

I just dont want Australia to be like the US, where everyone is sueing
everyone else for every possible reason they can.

No. A good example would be if the shopping center handed copies of a
transcript of the defamatory speech to everyone who queried the shopping
center for any word in that speech.

That's not true. Litigation is not ridiculous when it's your only
option to make people back down and do the right thing.

Get more informed on the suit. Both parties requested that Google
remove the offending posts from their archive. Google refused. So
therefore they are supporting the posts contents.

Don't agree, it ain't the 19th century any more. Google is merely a
recording instrument for usenet, the posters are those that should be
taken to task, not the recorder.

There's an uncountable number of posts slandering me recorded there, I'm
not enough of a pansy to give a shit.

The law says differently. If Google knows or believes that the
information is defamatory they have a duty to remove it.

If you ring up talkback radio and say (name here - a politician for
example) is a peadophile and the radio station does nothing to explain
to listeners that it is false the radio station will be sued and
rightfully so. Google has a duty to inform readers of the truth. Maybe
Google will be more careful in future on what news posts they publish,
same as radio, newspapers, etc. are now when they broadcast/publish
calls/letters.

so when the minutes are taken in court from the reading of these archived
transcripts, and the transcripts can be gained through freedom of
information, is the court then able to be sued as well?

Nah, I am pretty sure that the courts and Parliament are exempt.

    -Wrong with US law.

But these 2 men are from Australia. Remember the Australian's court
case against the New York Times? He won for defemation, even though
under US law the paper was fine. But the Australian court decided that
even though the NYT did not violate US law, it violated Australian law
and was read in Australia, so the paper was required to pay
compensation. Of course with that the US authorities would have to
enforce it, which I'm sure they did.

These posts are read in Australia though. It violates Australian law
so if Google wants to continue the way they are they should block
Australian's from accessing it.
