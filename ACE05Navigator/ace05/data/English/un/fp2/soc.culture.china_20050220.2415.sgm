Japanese Imperial army is joining tje US military to get recognition of
the Japanese Imperial rights to the Taiwan property , of Course the US
wants japan to defend Taiwan for the US military.

That is why , it is very dangerous to the world for the Japs to join
the UN security Council.

The US wants to japs to put up money for the defence of Taiwan , in
exchange for something which we don' t know .

The best response is to explode in secrete pplaces biological weapons
inside Japanese unfer ground systems ,like the Aum movements ,
or to place other biological weapons inside the Japs cities , so that
Japs will remember paints which they have inflicted on the Chinese
people.

japs will never learn any lessond , even though they pretend to
understand Nuclear weapons. Chinese must plant biological weapons
inside japan , either through thge North Koreans, or through other
agents.

But Chinese thsi time , must be serious about planting biological
weapons inside Japan.  Chinese must not threat , because thsi will be a
joke .

Chinese extremists must truelly act adn plant biological weapons inisde
Japan , so to show that Chinese are not like before , Chinese must use
biological weapons inside Japan, so to show that Chinese are too
civilised as a nation , Chinese must become agressive Barbarians , if
Chinese do not show the Banarians manners , the Japs will attack China
again.

This century , Chinese must act agressively, in order that Chinese can
show the world , that China is not afraid of wars.

Chinese in this century must show the Japs that China wants wars , if
Chinese continues to show a peaceful stupid passive attitude , US and
japan will attack China in thsi century.

China must show the Japs that China is looking forwards to wars in the
sea of Japan .

The only way to show Americans , is to prove to the US military ,that
China dares to fight the US in the China Sea.
If China shows peaceful attitude, the Japs will attack China again.

China must prove China wants to be agressive, if not, the US will act
in an agressive way towards the Chinese nation.

Make sure to read "China" in this story as "the Chinese Communists" in
order not to be misled.

    - BEIJING (AP) - China expressed 'serious concern' Sunday about military
    - cooperation between the United States and Japan, attacking a recent
    - joint statement on Taiwan as an unwelcome intrusion into Beijing's
    - affairs.
    - U.S. and Japanese officials meeting in Washington on Saturday listed
    - ''the peaceful resolution'' of the Taiwan issue as a strategic objective
    - and reaffirmed the two countries' security arrangements. Washington and
    - Tokyo said in a statement that they put ''the peaceful resolution of
    - issues concerning the Taiwan Strait through dialogue'' on a list of 12
    - strategic objectives.

    - Until now, Japan has left it to the United States to deal with China's
    - threats to use force against Taiwan, which Beijing views as a renegade
    - province that must be reabsorbed by the mainland.

    - The U.S. security alliance with Japan has formed the backbone of
    - American foreign policy in Asia since the 1960s. But the two allies
    - have long disagreed about how to deal with China's claim over
    - self-ruled Taiwan, which split with Beijing amid civil war in 1949.

    - Washington has indicated it would intervene if China was to try to take
    - Taiwan by force, while a cautious Japan traditionally has sought to
    - avoid involvement.

    - The Chinese Foreign Ministry said on its Web site that the
    - U.S.-Japanese statement about Taiwan ''concerns China's sovereignty,
    - territorial integrity and national security, and the Chinese government
    - and people firmly oppose it.''

    - China also called U.S.-Japan military cooperation a relic of the Cold
    - War that ''should not go beyond the bilateral scope.''

    - ''The Chinese side expresses serious concern,'' it said.

    - Beijing added that any concerns about a military buildup were unfounded
    - since it pursues a peaceful foreign policy.

    - Beijing eyes Japan with deep and bitter suspicion in light of Tokyo's
    - World War II aggression against China and a centuries-old rivalry for
    - dominance in east Asia.

Japan said that if the communist try to invade Taiwan, it would provide
logistics assistance to its American allies.

That is not remotely like "moving towards wars".

BTW, this is not new policy. The "newness" is the frank way that it is
expressed.
