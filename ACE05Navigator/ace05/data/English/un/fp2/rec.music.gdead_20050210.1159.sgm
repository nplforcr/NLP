    -Perhaps that should read:

    -''...the bombs are protection against an increasingly hostile
    -President/Administration of the United States''

    -Theresa

    -P.S. And why is it OK for the US of A to have nuclear weapons, but no one
    -else, hmmmm?
    Because

America would only ever use her powers for good and NK is part
of the axis of evil.

I'll agree that we'll use our nuclear power for good only, but NK is
indicating their withdrawl from the talks and their admission regarding
nukes has a lot to do with Bush's 'no-tyranny/no terror' agenda so stated
in his SOTU in January. I kind of like the idea that NK is drawing a line
in the sand (or rice paddy) and standing up against Bush and his rationale
for invading Iraq.

Perhaps the US should apply our nukes-for-good-only policy to our military
actions as of late (like since 2003).

This post is a joke, right?

You're a good gal, so I won't go off on you.

I will suggest you hit the library or internet to read up on Kim Jong Il,
his family background, the state of his people today (dropping dead in the
streets from cold and starvation-worse than the Leningrad famine of WWII),
and his history in the world of diplomacy. There's a lot of info out there
free for the asking. You could start with the first person eyewitness
accounts of refugees who have fled to China and S. Korea. That stuff will
tear your heart out.

Hopefully you won't be surprised by the fact that his actions have less than
nothing to do with anything Bush has ever said or done, but instead you will
be glad you took the time to discover what the most anti-freedom, anti-human
rights, anti-compassion, anti-environment government in the world is all
about. The biennial "I have the bomb" extortion ploy has only worked once
so far (when Clinton gave them some nuclear technology and some of the food
needed to keep their scientists upright long enough to get some work done),
and most rational observers understand that the lunatic killer is just
playing the same old game he's always played.

Someday he really might come up with a working bomb, so any US President has
a responsibility to take that seriously. But he doesn't have one now, and
Bush isn't invading. Why not? Because.............

Organization and Disposition

With over a million active-duty personnel, the Army has eight conventional
infantry corps, four mechanized corps, an armored corps, an artillery corps,
and a Capital Defense Corps that provides defense for Pyongyang during
wartime operations.

Weapons and Equipment

The ground forces are by far the largest and most formidable of North
Korea's military forces. In the 1980s, Army force structure became
increasingly mobile and mechanized, with a steady increase in tanks,
self-propelled artillery, armored personnel carriers, and trucks.

North Korea has some 3,500 medium and light tanks, which include about 2,000
T-54/55 main battle tanks, and an estimated 175 Chinese Type 59 tanks (an
upgraded version of the T-54). The T-54, produced in the Soviet Union from
l947 to l981, has a 100-mm rifled main tank gun. Since the late l970s, North
Korea has produced an estimated 600 T-62 tanks, the Soviet Army's main
battle tank in the l960s. North Korea also has fielded light tanks,
including the indigenously produced M-1985, the Soviet P-76, and the Chinese
Type 62 and 63 variants.

North Korea continues to rely on massive quantities of artillery systems to
support ground operations. The North Korean Air Force's perceived
vulnerability contributes to this reliance on field artillery as the major
combat multiplier for combat operations. Consequently, Pyongyang has
deployed about 8,400 artillery pieces and over 2,000 multiple rocket
launchers. North Korea has at least 3,000 towed and 5,400 self-propelled
guns and howitzers. In the l980s, North Korea produced a significant amount
of self-propelled artillery by mating towed artillery tubes with chassis
already in the inventory. North Korean ordnance factories produce a variety
of self-propelled guns, howitzers, gun- howitzers (ranging from 122-mm to
152-mm), and the new KOKSAN gun first noted in a 1985 parade. North Korea
also manufactures at least four models of multiple rocket launchers --
107-mm, 122-mm, 140-mm, and 240-mm -- and mounts many of them on heavy
trucks.
Although the Army's major elements are infantry forces, it has about 4,000
armored personnel carriers. The Army has a significant number of
well-equipped mechanized units. These mobile forces have Soviet, Chinese,
and indigenously produced armored personnel carriers. They also provide
Pyongyang with a capable, well-trained exploitation force that could
capitalize on breakthroughs in South Korean and US defensive lines.

****************************** ****************************** 

Keep in mind that North Korea's million man and woman military (out of a
total population of 22 million) is almost as large as the US military; we
have somewhere around 2 million service people (out of a population of
almost 300 million) and ours are spread all over our country and the world.

Since the North Korean military would all be crammed into a few square miles
while defending any invasion casualties would be stratospherically enormous.
While most North Koreans are under 5 feet 2 (caused by childhood
malnutrution) and while most presumably would be unable to think well on
their feet and lack the ability to improvise (most North Koreans suffer from
brain damage caused by childhood malnutrition) the threat of a murdered
family and the promise of an extra bowl of rice, coupled with the slavish
devotion to their leader surely held by at least some soldiers, leads most
experts to believe that most would actually fight, unlike the Iraqis who
dropped their guns and ran at the first bullet.

The only way to win a war with them would be to literally kill all of them,
an option totally unacceptable to S. Korea and Japan.

Sadly, the only hope for a permanent peace with that nation and the only
hope for any kind of human life for its people is for the regime to
collapse. That will happen only if there is no longer enough meager rations
to keep the military on its feet, which means starvation on a scale larger
than is already occurring. Otherwise the only possibility is if the leader
were to die and a some semi-moderate general (along the lines of
Stalin---far more moderate than the current leader) seized power and said
"enough is enough" to the rest of the world.

Meanwhile, back in North Korea, its is now unpatriotic to have hair longer
than a buzzcut, and the military is rigorously enforcing the new edict, said
to have germinated in a dream of the leader.

Reality rarely intrudes into the mind of Kim Jong Il. I've read a few
assessments by psychiatrists, all who believe he just may be certifiably
insane.
