Who's Going? Who's taking a Cruise?
As many of you already know, there's a page on
AllEarsNet.com with The List of People Who Will be at
WDW or Who Will be Cruising with Disney at:

If you send an email to me at d...@allearsnet.com
and tell me when you'll be in the parks and where you'll be
staying OR when you're setting sail, I'll
add you to The List. This will, I hope, make it easier for you
to meet up with others who'll be at the park or on a Disney Cruise
at the same time.

Neither the news post nor the web page are updated right away, so
please allow a little time before you wonder why you aren't
listed.

Also, if you live or work near WDW and
you want people to know how to get in touch with you
if they're visiting, send me an email.
Locals are placed after the list of upcoming visitors.

Disclaimer:
----------
I am not representing any opinion about the
character of anyone on this list, nor whether he/she
will add to the magical experience that will surely
be your visit to Walt Disney World. I have not
verified that these people are nice, friendly,
stable, nor even if they hold reservations as they claim. :-)

THE LOCALS

Princesscraz...@yahoo.com (Stephanie) -- Hi! I'm a 20-year-old college
student from Massachusetts and I will be doing my internship at Disney
World August 25-January 5. I'm looking to meet new friends
that would like to hang out or even visit a park. Please e-mail me! Thanks!

hosewa...@hotmail.com (E.J. Farr) -- I am currently working at Pop
Century as part of the Front Office team, starting in Luggage, so for
all of you lucky enough to be staying at Disney's newest
resort, I'll see you there!

t...@oitc.com -- I live near WDW in the Spacecoast area of Florida and
visit all the time and would love to meet up with some fellow Disney Fans.

dsny...@kua.net (Arlen Miller) - Hi! I live here locally so I go to the
parks 3-4 times a week. I would be happy to get together with anyone who
also enjoys the parks as much as I do. I can point out things that most
people miss in the parks (as I used to work in the parks as well). Just
e-mail me with a date &amp; time and if you like to trade pins, bring yours
along to trade too!

mscibe...@prodigy.net (Michael A. Scibetta) - Michael (aka Crazy Hakim)
spends a lot of time on Walt Disney World property and still keeps in
touch with many Disney fans. He's a member of two Orlando chapters of
NFFC and enjoys meeting other "Disnoids."

r...@figzu.com (Bruce Metcalf) - "Park history maven and deep-dipped
pixie duster only too happy to meet both local and long-distance
RADPers. Park tours and trivia quiz optional."

CoasterG...@att.net and CoasterD...@att.net (Kris and Tim Wiley) -
Long-time lurkers who recently moved to the Orlando area. Would like to
meet other folks who enjoy Disney, too.

Yankee...@donniebaseball.com (Joe) - I recently moved to Florida after
my college internship with Disney ended and I stayed on with the
company. I would love to get together with anyone who is coming
down for a visit to hang out with, grab some dinner, or visit a park! I
never get tired of this place!

jmcki...@kjsl.com (Jimmy McKinley) - I'm a Main Street USA Cast Member,
currently working weekends, 2-10:30 p.m. for the parades. My wife and
three children occasionally visit the parks with me -- we live just
outside of Fort Wilderness! Look for me on Main Street!

Stephe...@yahoo.com (Stephen Grubb) - Calling all Disney fans! I moved
to Ft. Lauderdale from Indiana recently for the warm weather and to be
closer to the Mouse. I often visit the parks on weekends and
would love to meet with other Disney fans!

t...@alongtheway.com (Tim Bithoney) - I live in Tampa and am always
looking to meet up with people to go to WDW. Please email me!

blhuff...@yahoo.com (Bob Huffer) - I'm finally back in Florida, living
in north Orlando and on the lookout for new friends to help me get
maximum use out of my AP. Email is always welcome.

k...@heathrowcable.net (Karen Burke) -- As a WDW fanatic since I first
came in 1974, I am dying to connect with fellow Mouse-o-maniacs. I love
it so much that for its sake I actually moved my whole
family here, all the way from Minnesota. I have a couple wild and woolly
teens, boy and girl, who grew up on WDW as well, plus a husband who
enjoys the shows and artistry of Disney, but can only do
the mildest types of rides. So my household has opinions and experiences
galore! I'd love to meet people in the Parks and show 'em around a
little, or converse by internet, or meet the RADP group
after reading enviously about your get-togethers for so long. Count me in!

sand...@kua.net (Jennifer)-- I live in W. Kissimmee and go to the parks,
waterparks, DisneyQuest, Pleasure Island about 4-5 times a week. I would
love to meet up with anyone (especially with kids --
I have two boys) to talk Disney with, visit a park, and/or trade pins!
Just email me if you would like to get together!

asanc...@tampabay.rr.com (Sanchez Family) --We live about 90 minutes
from WDW and visit the parks a few times a month. We are 40 yo male, 38
yo female, 13 yo male and 9 yo female. We enjoy all the parks and would
like to meet fellow Disney fanatics and spend the day sharing our
knowledge of the parks. If you want to meet up, just drop us an e-mail
with the days you will be there.

Melissa02...@yahoo.com (Melissa) -- HI! Melissa from Orlando here... I
am still working at Roaring Fork in Wilderness Lodge. If anyone is in
the area, I'd love them to stop by and say hello!
