<SUBJECT> Another merger </SUBJECT>

Sufferin' succotash. Just read that Sears and Kmart will merge, an 11 billion
buck deal, with the Kmart head leading the Sears Holding Co. that will emerge,
and the Sears CEO being CEO of the group.

I can see the benefit to Kmart. I cannot see the benefit to Sears.

Oh, yeah. Headquarters to remain at Sears headquarters, with a "significant
presence" at Kmart headquarters.

Predicted to be a $55 billion company, but I've seen claims for larger than
life companies before, including one I recently worked for that claimed $100
million, when balance sheets showed it was about $38-$45 million back then.

Supposed to come in as #3 behind Walmart and Target.

I'm no retail genius--or any other kind--but it seems to me that Sears long
ago conceded the rural market that it was built upon to WalMart. As an
urban-suburban retailer, Sears needed more street locations than dying malls
could provide; enter K-Mart.
Also, K-Mart can be an outlet for cheaper goods that Sears can buy in
quantity, maybe even the Lands End stuff that hasn't been doing well in the
mainline stores.

I don't follow it either. Kmart just underwent a major restructuring last
year (or so). I think they declared bankruptcy and issued new stock. In
the meantime, they have been struggling with cash flow and have been selling
off a lot of their buildings and properties to keep the company afloat. I
don't see why Sears would want to hitch it's wagon to Kmart.

Obviously, someone there sees some brilliance in the idea, but IIRC, Kmart came
close to going all the way down the tubes a couple years ago, while Sears'
performance hasn't been stellar in recent years (going back to when the hired
the Bloomingdale type as Prez, I think).

My problem with the concept is that I've done some low end shopping at Kmart
(usually to get Coke when it's on sale there and not elsewhere).

The stores are dirty, low ceilinged, stocked poorly and haphazardly, and the
personnel might be desirable in an "ignore the asshole, he's only a customer"
contest, but otherwise, I guess Kmart is OK.

Sears retail stores seem to be understaffed, but the staff I've seen have all
been at least halfway decently trained, are polite and have at least a small
clue as to why they're there.

Hell, my mother was an inveterate bargain shopper--raised during the Great
Depression and had a solid talent for making a dime do a dollar's worth of
buying--but she avoided Kmart (and Caldor in upstate NY). And she died a dozen
years ago, after being away from Kmarts for nearly a decade, so the decline I
see in them is no recent thing.

But maybe it will work out. Nice to think so. I think I still prefer the Sears
of my youth, with no bricks &amp; mortar stores to amount to anything.

Actually, Kmart has had 3 consecutive profitable quarters, while sears has
had losses 13 of the last 16 quarters. Seems kmart has successfully re-invented
itself, perhaps sears can learn from that.
