I heard it on the news.

If you were a betting man, what odds would you give for him being
released?

I'm not convinced that he did it but, if the burden of proof has
switched to the defence, then I doubt he will be released unless some
new irrefutable evidence has come to light.

I have always thought he is innocent,fitted up by the Kent police,to get a
high profile case off the books.
When he is found to be not guilty,he will rightly be entitled to
compensation,this will be paid by tax payers and not the corrupt police
force of Kent

But the Police are funded from tax payer's money so we still end up paying.

Tricky one this because one half of me says he should stay in prison. I
don't think Stone did the Chillenden murders, but....he is one nasty menace
who has a very violent past &amp; has given some people some serious nasty
beatings/stabbings, if he is released then it wont be long until he has hurt
somebody else. However if the man is not guilty as charged then he must be
released.
Regards,
K.

I understand you meaning I think.
I can't prove that I didn't do it either - but, although my background
is not lillywhite, it's nothing like Michael Stone's.

I don't think that is necessarily the case. It appears that Stone has
had treatment for his drug addictions and mental health problems while
inside, so may be far less of a risk than he was when he went in.

If Stone is innocent and didnt make the cell confession, how did the person
who is supposed to have fitted him up know stuff that only Stone would have
known? Stuff that hadnt been published in any newspaper?

What is this information that you claim Stone would have known but
neither the murderer nor the police would have known?

Cynic,

Daley told police that Stone had told him, during the cell confession, he
had been identified by one of the witnesses in the ID parade ( he called her
a bitch and said he would have got away with it if she hadnt picked him out)

This was never published in any newspaper so could only have come from Stone
himself. So if Daley is lying, where did he get this info from?
