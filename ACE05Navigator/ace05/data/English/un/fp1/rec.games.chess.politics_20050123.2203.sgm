Laugh - I knew this was the plan a good while ago, not soon after he was
hired. Last summer anyway.

In the interim we had to read all that crap about what an okay editor...
contrasted by the usual public Silence about what insiders actually thought
[they didn't think anything]

I tested the waters in the Fall when I noticed a retraction from those who
had interviewed him and proposed him on the basis of personal meetings, who
were now politically diffident, saying nothing in 1,000 words on the
subject.

Readers seemed to actually detest the guy. Pity on him, what a horrible
magazine to take over with no sense of who it is oriented to or what purpose
it serves. The Mag with the biggest membership and always last on every
prefered list of chess magazines.

Kalev Pehme never had a chance - even if he could actually write, and more
so, write about chess without pissing every body off. Not one significant
interview in an entire year, nor any memorable bit or journalism from his
writers.

Pah!

Then again, neither did the chess public have a chance since there has not
been a survey of CL readers since Larry Parr started wearing long trousers.

Glenn has been doing most of the work. Why not hire him? Unless you want the
job Charlie.

Kalev Pehme did not deserve to be fired.

Sam Sloan writes that Beatriz Marinello has fired Kalev Pehme. I don't doubt
that she wanted him gone, but the editor was fired by the Board in a 5 to 2
with Schultz and Brady voting against.

One assumes that Tim Hanke's vote to fire means he will not be working for
Chess Life in any capacity for at least two years after he is off the Board,
when he might make a fine editor.

I think Kalev Pehme made the magazine look better and read better, though he
offended a number of persons.

Here is my read on his firing: he was not fired because the politically
correct crowd didn't like his writing about women players, nor was he fired
because Paul Truong and Susan Polgar wanted him out. Nor, I think, was he fired
because the average reader disliked the magazine, which looked fine, arrived on
time (for the first time in many a moon) and kept improving with each issue.

I think he got the ax because the scholastic people wanted him out, which
marks a watershed in the history of this Federation's affairs: for the first
time a membership faction as opposed purely to a political faction (though
there was that, too) has prevailed in the firing of an editor.

Which is another reason why we may not see Tim Hanke showing up as editor. I
know Tim through his written product, and his mind is simply too sharp to get
satisfaction from the kind of magazine some of the scholastic people may want
to produce. Very quickly, our Tim would prove unable to suffer fools gladly.
There would be gibes at grammar and receding foreheads -- and he, too, would be
gone.

Mr. Pehme's replacement will likely be former editor Glenn Peterson, who put
out some excellent issues of Chess Life. If he can summon the physical strength
for the job again, he will prove a good replacement. If Glenn cannot, there is
the lugubrious prospect that Beatriz will kill him off -- quite literally.

The above is, I think, the nub of the matter.

Liarry never lets truth get in the way of his rants. Pehme was a crappy editor
who knew nothing of chess. Oh, now I see why Liarry thought highly of him - the
only CL editor who could make his years of yammering as editor look tolerable.
