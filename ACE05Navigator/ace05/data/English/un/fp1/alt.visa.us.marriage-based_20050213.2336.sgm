<SUBJECT> Wife refused to have divorce </SUBJECT>


This board has helped me with a lot of useful information from the
beginning of my journey but the journey is about to end. I'm a USC, we
were married on 11/02 and got our conditional GC on 11/04, three days
before our 2nd wedding anniversary. Our marriage was great until my ex
started to appear into my life. we started having arguments constantly
ever since. To make the story short, I could not take it anymore so I
asked her for a divorce. She's doesn't want a divorce b/c of the
filing of the i-751 and the interview. I told her there's nothing to
worry about since she can file on her own and we have evidence of a bona
fide marriage. I am ready to move on without having these constant
headaches. Should I stay and filed i-751 with her for another year or
hell with it get a divorce and move on?

Dear Newbie:

I feel like writing a bit, so let me give this a shot.

As a general rule, I think that Decency trumps the Law. I'm not quite
sure why I feel this way. Maybe it is because we have to live with
ourselves and decency is always a nice thing to have on your side and
living inside yourself.

Putting off the divorce until the I-751 process is complete is the
decent thing to do.

And yet, I must say that I have handled several matters where things
were put off until after the I-751 has been completed. And this has
always come to grief for the US Citizen spouse, (divorce-wise, the
shorter the term of the marriage the better).

I'm not sure why this would be so...it seems counter-intuitive to me,
but this has been my experience. On the other hand, I only see things
when they go bad. This may go on quite a bit and it works out well for
the parties involved but I just never get to see it because it is done
on an entirely amicable basis.

This is entirely your call, your decision. I don't believe that your
wife has a choice if you file for divorce or not. You just do it.

How to weigh out these factors is difficult...but if there is NO
chance of reconciliation, no chance that counseling or some other
thing might help save this marriage...

Then I'll bite the bullet and tell you to just file the divorce and
let the chips fall where they may.

Tough advice...but there it is.

Best Wishes,

Traveller

This isn't my situation and I don't know you or your wife, so I can just
give you my uninformed opinion, but you asked for it so here you go! :)

You have a life to live, and apparently, it's not going to include your
current wife. You should file for your divorce and start moving on.
Putting your entire life on hold so that she can advance hers doesn't
make sense if it's just a matter of time before she's out the door. Why
is her life more important than yours? It seems she thinks you should
make sacrifices for her so that she won't have to make any sacrifices
herself. Seems very unfair to me!

As for her refusing or not wanting a divorce, well, this is America and
tough luck, but one partner wanting a divorce is enough.

So, go for it. You only have one life, and there is no sense in giving
up part of it for someone who won't give anything up for you.

    - Thanks to alll that replied. I have tried so hard to work it out but
    - once i thought it would settle, it leads back to more frustration. If
    - i file for divorce, what action will be against me with the i-751
    - other than the obligation of the i-864? If she file on her own,
    - eventually with the interview, do i have to come with her?

You don't have to go to the interview with her. I believe she becomes
deportable one year after the I-751 is filed unless she successfully has
the conditions removed.

I'd say that her wanting to pretend to be happily married for
immigration purposes shows how she feels about marriage, and is somewhat
dishonest.

As for the I-864, has anyone ever heard of one actually being enforced?
