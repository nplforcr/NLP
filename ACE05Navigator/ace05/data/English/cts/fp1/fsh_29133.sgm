Oh cool.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Vicky </SPEAKER>
fabrics and crafts store.

We love that place.

Yeah a lot of people do.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sandra </SPEAKER>
It's a big chain.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Vicky </SPEAKER>
Yeah, it's -- it's very big. I think we have -- like a hundred and twenty

</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sandra </SPEAKER>
Oh wow.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Vicky </SPEAKER>
Yeah
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sandra </SPEAKER>

</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Vicky </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sandra </SPEAKER>
Is it part time or full time?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Vicky </SPEAKER>
Part time
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sandra </SPEAKER>
That's cool.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Vicky </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sandra </SPEAKER>
Our job is full time, but it's really relaxed, because it's like um
ours is a traveling ministry, so we get to travel everywhere and we're
we're going to start to go to foreign countries and um we do work long
hours, but it's easy because it's like working -- the um the Lord's
work, and to us, that's easy.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Vicky </SPEAKER>
Uh-huh.  Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sandra </SPEAKER>
But we we make special visits to like people in hospitals that are
sick and wherever God sends us, we just -- you know, whatever he needs
us to do, we do it.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Vicky </SPEAKER>
Uh-huh.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sandra </SPEAKER>
So we enjoy our job.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Vicky </SPEAKER>
Uh-huh.  I like my job, too uh it -- It can be very -- frustrating, and
you know -- people getting mad at you for things you have no control
over.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sandra </SPEAKER>
Mhm.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Vicky </SPEAKER>
You have to be -- the right type of person -- able to handle that.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sandra </SPEAKER>
Yeah.  So who's over you, just one person or more than one?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Vicky </SPEAKER>
Oh, there's more than one. We have a front end supervisor. She runs
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sandra </SPEAKER>
Mhm.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Vicky </SPEAKER>
the cash registers, and all that, you know uh and the- then every
department has its own supervisor -- and then we have -- an operational
manager, and then we have
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sandra </SPEAKER>
Wow.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Vicky </SPEAKER>
a store manager
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sandra </SPEAKER>
Mhm.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Vicky </SPEAKER>
so -- and then, that's just in our location, and then I don't know who
they report to.  But, yeah it's -- it's a lot of managers.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sandra </SPEAKER>
Wow.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Vicky </SPEAKER>
Mhm.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sandra </SPEAKER>
Basically, my mom's the owner of the organization, and she's like the
head, and everyone looks up to her because God placed a special
anointing of leadership upon her and -- she has like a -- She has a
prophetic mantle and -- she hears from God like frequently, so when we
discuss things, we'll take it to her
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Vicky </SPEAKER>
Mhm.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sandra </SPEAKER>
and um -- I guess to improve -- our -- organization,  it'd be to add more
people
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Vicky </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sandra </SPEAKER>
since we're just starting out.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Vicky </SPEAKER>
Ours would be to n- -- improve the communication between the managers
because one will tell you to do things -- one way, and then another will
say no, you're doing it wrong, do it this way
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sandra </SPEAKER>
Uh-huh.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Vicky </SPEAKER>
so
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sandra </SPEAKER>
Oh yeah, that causes confusion.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Vicky </SPEAKER>
Yeah.  There's n- There is not -- good communication at all -- in the
store.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sandra </SPEAKER>
Can they report you, like -- is there people that can report you and get
you in trouble?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Vicky </SPEAKER>
um -- I don't know if anybody really reports anybody.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sandra </SPEAKER>
Oh that's good. Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Vicky </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sandra </SPEAKER>
Because my friend works in a hospital, and she said all day long she
has to put up with that. There's people whining, and they write you
up, and then she has to go before a board of members, and she said
it's really terrible.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Vicky </SPEAKER>
Oh.  Wow.  No.  We don't do that.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sandra </SPEAKER>
Mhm.  I think one of the reasons they do it is because she's been
there so long, she's ready to retire, and they don't want you to get
any benefits, they want to just kind of like -- let you go or something,
and -- so she's constantly getting in trouble because her retirement's
coming up.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Vicky </SPEAKER>
Oh. Yeah.
