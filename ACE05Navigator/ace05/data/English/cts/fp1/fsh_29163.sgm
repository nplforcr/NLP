</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sharon </SPEAKER>
Mhm.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Kevin </SPEAKER>
I mean he was a -- he was -- you know, he ran the company all right but it

</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sharon </SPEAKER>
Was this a small company then?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Kevin </SPEAKER>
Yeah, it was kind of small. There was only about eight or nine people
working there.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sharon </SPEAKER>
Oh, okay.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Kevin </SPEAKER>
Um -- and just, I mean, he he got along with everybody but it just -- you
know it wasn't very well -- and it could've been organized and run a
little bit better than than what he did.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sharon </SPEAKER>
Yeah. Was it a private company?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Kevin </SPEAKER>
Yeah, it was a private company. um We did a lot of contract work but
we weren't
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sharon </SPEAKER>
Okay.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Kevin </SPEAKER>
you know, we weren't like tied to any one -- uh aerospace company we
were just an independent uh contractor for them.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sharon </SPEAKER>
Nine, eight or nine people of course everybody pretty much doing
different jobs.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Kevin </SPEAKER>
Yeah we all everybody was kind of specialized. Um we
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sharon </SPEAKER>
Okay.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Kevin </SPEAKER>
so um
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sharon </SPEAKER>
And then usually point it to one main person or w- the woman and then
there was the owner basically.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Kevin </SPEAKER>
Yeah that wh- what really needed to happen was there needed to be a
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sharon </SPEAKER>
Okay.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Kevin </SPEAKER>
like a um a shop manager in between him -- and us, the workers, because
he was trying to run the office,  um do quotes on jobs,
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sharon </SPEAKER>
Mm.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Kevin </SPEAKER>
and run the back -- part -- and make decisions and do everything. He was
he was micro-managing the entire place and it
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sharon </SPEAKER>
Yeah.  Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Kevin </SPEAKER>
and it was really kind of hard for us -- because you know if if he was
tied up with with clients or having to go to Lockheed Martin for a day
or something like that it was kind of tough to -- to have any decisions
made at a crucial moment so.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sharon </SPEAKER>
And so you sa- what was that position you said that -- would th- would
have been good to have between him and -- the rest of everybody?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Kevin </SPEAKER>
uh Like a shop manager.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sharon </SPEAKER>
Some manage (()) his own manager or anything like that.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Kevin </SPEAKER>
No, he was the only one that
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sharon </SPEAKER>
Ah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Kevin </SPEAKER>
made the decision if any decisions need to be made I mean he was like
the only one to go to.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sharon </SPEAKER>
Yeah, it's pretty tough.  The owner is in trying to manage everything
at the same time.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Kevin </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sharon </SPEAKER>
I mean, yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Kevin </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sharon </SPEAKER>
That's a big
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Kevin </SPEAKER>
Yeah, I mean it's a l-
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sharon </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Kevin </SPEAKER>
it's a lot of responsibility plus -- you know um having to sometimes you
know -- deal with customers you know that come in or clients and stuff
and you know it.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sharon </SPEAKER>
Yeah.  Okay.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Kevin </SPEAKER>
I do- -- How was your um -- uh organizational in your company?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sharon </SPEAKER>
Well -- Well I was always for true um big corporations so it's kind of a
typical big software corporation.  um On the local site here we have
about -- eighty people -- the most -- um -- and it's part of a -- like -- the
fifteen hundred wide -- company-wide -- company
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Kevin </SPEAKER>
Mhm.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sharon </SPEAKER>
fifteen hundred people. So, in a in this in a typical corporation -- you
know you have your ~CEO at the very top which you hardly see at all y-
you get see some ~CEOs and then it filters down to some other ~CEOs
like I could be a ~CEO of fi- -- finance, ~CEO of engineering and so on,
or in sales, ~CEO of marketing and then you've got y- and then they
have their own managers below them -- and then those managers have other
managers
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Kevin </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sharon </SPEAKER>
and then -- then finally to the bottom you got the employees.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Kevin </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sharon </SPEAKER>
um -- I'm basically um just um one of the engineer type people -- for
engineers.  And -- so I'm in a department and there's like ten of us
and then we have our test department manager -- and um -- and then he
reports to you know um more of a senior development manager.  And so
and that and that's kind of typical. I've worked at for two different
software corporations and that's very typical of the -- the hierarchy.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Kevin </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
