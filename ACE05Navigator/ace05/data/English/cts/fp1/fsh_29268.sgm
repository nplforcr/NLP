guilty,  and they presented a lot of evidence, and uh, I watched uh,
you know, I I followed it not real real close but pretty close and it
seems as if,  um,  the evidence -- stacked up -- uh, overwhelming -- uh -ly
in,  in favor that, uh,  i- it's a gr- very great likelihood that he
you know, it's more than a coincidence, uh. Uh, they had a lot more

the media for instance.

they did tell enough of what they were allowed to tell.  Eh, you know,
this is the case where -- When was it? I think it, wasn't it last
Christmas time this beautiful,  very pretty, sweet, beautiful, uh,
young woman, I guess in her late twenties, maybe,  maybe, probably
late twenties was pregnant and w- came missing.  And it, uh, sparked
a national search for her.  Do you remember?

<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mohammed </SPEAKER>
Ah, I remember. It was almost one year.  And then what happened after
that?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
And then what happened, was uh, there -- w- the, I guess the um,  the
police investigators -- must have been suspicious, or something, and
they were following the husband.  And,  is going out to this family
and feeling bad. Wow,  and hoping that sh- -- And uh, so then, um,  they
follow him and they find out that he has a girlfriend,  and he's been
having a girlfriend.  So, he was, uh, seeing this gal -- on the side,
eh, behind his wife's back and his wife's going to have a baby and
everything. And, and uh, the girlfriend said she didn't even know he
was married.  So, I guess he was cheating all the way around. And uh,
you know, not being honest. And then, uh,  what happened was, uh,  he
was married and,  and apparently -- successful for him, or something.
And so maybe he got rid of his wife because -- he wanted to be with the
girlfriend. But anyways, while she's still missing and the country's
still looking for her, he goes out and he sells her car.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mohammed </SPEAKER>
Wonderful relationship.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
You know? He just sells her car.  Uh, he gets rid of her starts
getting rid of some of her possessions, especially her really
expensive vehicle.  her to have an expensive car. And so he, while
she's missing and everyone's hoping she returns home, and he's
supposed to be an upset husband -- and started following him and finding
out some clues and evidence -- more and more, and then it didn't take so
long that -- her body was found.  I think like in the river, or
something -- like this, or washed up from the water of the river into on
to the land.  And I don't know how this happened, but you know,  there
was a baby, you know, like a,  like a,  a dead baby -- a dead unborn
baby -- that floated up,  uh, on to the land, or -- by her body.  I don't
know how the baby came out. I don't really quite understand, but I
guess that's not the issue.  And uh, so every the country, you know,
it shocked -- the morality. It shocked the conscious the conscience-
ness, you know, the conscience -- of the people.  And, uh, I'm just a
typical, normal person I hope. You know? And it all made us feel
sorry, you know? Made us feel bad -- that such a terrible thing would
happen.  You know?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mohammed </SPEAKER>
I mean at the time, I think all this is was carried by the media.  Was
it good,  or it's supposed to be *teached some other way, you think?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
I don't know. What do,  what do you think?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mohammed </SPEAKER>
It has two sides, I think. One side it is good for the people to
understand and, eh, feel, uh, the *sympathism of the case, and the
other thing is -- it's too bad also for some people they are *hurted.
such, uh, a thing to happen in the society.  So it has, actually, both
sides. One is good. One is bad.
