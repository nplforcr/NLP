</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Greg </SPEAKER>
Mhm.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Frank </SPEAKER>
uh The job I had -- we had a district manager and the we had an
administrative officer -- and then we had -- uh two heads of -- no three
heads of -- departments. We only had twenty-five people in the office
but -- we had uh -- had three -- uh department heads -- and I came under one
of those.  We had the biggest -- the biggest number, the largest number
of people in the office. We had about -- well, what did we have?
Fourteen I think in in my division.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Greg </SPEAKER>
Mhm.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Frank </SPEAKER>
Like I say I -- all of the offices -- pretty much -- uh in other states
were configured the same way. You had a d- a district manager and and
maybe an assistant if it was a large enough office.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Greg </SPEAKER>
Mhm.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Frank </SPEAKER>
And uh then -- some offices had -- had more divisions.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Greg </SPEAKER>
Hm.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Frank </SPEAKER>
uh
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Greg </SPEAKER>
Well I am retired also, I was ((medically)) retired oh I don't know,
about ten, fifteen years ago, something like that.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Frank </SPEAKER>
Uh-huh.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Greg </SPEAKER>
Those days I was in, my god, we had it was very hierarchical
structure.  Uh we had about uh
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Frank </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Greg </SPEAKER>
hundred thousand people who -- uh world wide in the whole thing
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Frank </SPEAKER>
Oh, uh-huh.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Greg </SPEAKER>
uh and uh I'm trying to think. Well we -- my final position. I was in
charge of a an office where we dealt with boilers.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Frank </SPEAKER>
Uh-huh.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Greg </SPEAKER>
And uh -- oh god I'm trying to think how many people I had working for
me. Uh -- I had fifteen in the office and then uh -- oh on the order of
probably fifteen reporting to each one of them. And we had offices
like in Philadelphia -- out of joint and uh -- and one up in Pittsburgh.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Frank </SPEAKER>
Uh-huh.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Greg </SPEAKER>
But that was like in the uh uh it was in the home home office with a
((manager)) too.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Frank </SPEAKER>
Uh-huh.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Greg </SPEAKER>
We had uh departments of ah -- ah -- ship engineering, aviation
engineering uh -- research and development,  nuclear engineering -- and so
I was in one of those I was in the engineering branch just sort of
ship engineering.  And uh -- basically uh like I say very very structure
organization, uh -- well uh it was it was eh the Navy.  ah -- I'm trying
I'm trying to think I was in -- I was a designer.  And we had just you
know, you built from the bottom up. The guys started out as uh -- ((got
them smart)) and they uh -- percolate up in the organization.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Frank </SPEAKER>
Uh-huh.  So -- w- w- were you in the navy, or a civilian?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Greg </SPEAKER>
No I was eh I was an officer in the Navy.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Frank </SPEAKER>
You were an officer, okay. Well I worked for the federal government.
uh The Bureau of Land Management.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Greg </SPEAKER>
Okay.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Frank </SPEAKER>
Managed -- uh land -- uh mostly in the western states.  And I uh I began
in Idaho -- and then transferred to Utah -- and then went to uh -- North
Dakota.  uh At various times I was in charge of a number of people.
But as the job varied um eh -- Well one time I had -- oh what did I have,
ten people -- I was in charge of for -- a year.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Greg </SPEAKER>
Mhm.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Frank </SPEAKER>
And then the work changed and uh -- I went back to -- not supervising
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Greg </SPEAKER>
Right.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Frank </SPEAKER>
so I kind of went back and forth depending on on the workload and -- and
what positions needed -- somebody in them. If somebody left -- uh either
retired or moved, and they couldn't find a replacement -- uh then they
would ask some of -- the rest of us if we wanted to fill in for a while.
So -- I did that a number of times
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Greg </SPEAKER>
Well I was going to say, would that involve like the uh Indian
reservation, things like that.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Frank </SPEAKER>
but uh -- ah We yes we dealt with Indian reservations -- as part of the
job.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Greg </SPEAKER>
Right.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Frank </SPEAKER>
Because the federal government has -- a trust responsibilities -- with
regard to the -- to the Indians -- ah parts of the -- parts of the
reservation.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Greg </SPEAKER>
Mhm.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Frank </SPEAKER>
uh w- -- well -- latter part of my career I was -- I dealt with them ah
with regard to their oil and gas properties -- and worked with them
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Greg </SPEAKER>
Hm.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Frank </SPEAKER>
on managing those, because -- uh the agency I worked for was
responsible -- for managing all the oil and gas uh -- federal minerals
across the whole ~US.  eh We had offices in -- oh every state -- in the
western states -- and then an office in eh -- Milwaukee -- one in
Mississippi,  eh one in Louisiana,  one in Virginia.  And we were also
responsible for -- uh -- surveying
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Greg </SPEAKER>
Hm.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Frank </SPEAKER>
markers eh surveying -- in other words not somebody's individual house,
when -- somebody's -- when a house traded hands.  But any federal -- uh
section markers -- section line -- uh markers with regard to federal land
of any kind -- and our agency has a responsibility. So we have -- have
surveyors -- scattered around the country that do that, because they're
you know whether it's on Navy or wherever -- eh our agency has a
responsibility.
