3. Bush Cabinet President Bush has just been elected to another term
in office, and he has already started to appoint new people to his
political cabinet as current members like Colin Powell and John
Ashcroft resign.  Who would you like to see appointed to his cabinet
next term?  Who are they, and why do you think they should be
appointed? If you were president, which national figures would you
appoint to your cabinet and why?  What new cabinet positions would you
create and who would fill them?

<SPEAKER> Debbie </SPEAKER>
Hello.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Dominic </SPEAKER>
Hi.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Debbie </SPEAKER>
Hi.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Dominic </SPEAKER>
Hi, my name is Dominic. I'm in San Francisco.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Debbie </SPEAKER>
I'm Debbie, I'm in New York.  I'm sorry to say that I don't know too
much about politics,  so I really don't know
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Dominic </SPEAKER>
I don't either.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Debbie </SPEAKER>
who he should appoint to his cabinet -- I don't even who is out there
and if you ask me to name his cabinet,  I could not tell you, although
I will say that after the election, I was wondering if my vote would
have been different had I known that so many people -- would have taken
off right after, like if I knew Colin Powell was going to resign
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Dominic </SPEAKER>
Mhm.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Debbie </SPEAKER>
I mean, I think you should know those things while running, who plans
on staying and who plans on going.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Dominic </SPEAKER>
Well, but you're not voting for the cabinet, you are voting for the
President, right?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Debbie </SPEAKER>
Well, the first time I voted for Bush, it was because I was told that
he -- would pick a good cabinet, so it was running or flying solo.  So I
think, part of his decisions are helped made by having good people
surrounding him. If you don't know who's going to be surrounding him,
then uh,  you know, like I was kind of happy as Colin Powell as uh
Secretary of the State
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Dominic </SPEAKER>
Mhm.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Debbie </SPEAKER>
not that I'm unhappy with the Condoleezza Rice, but um, and most of
the people in this cabinet, I just don't know.  Uh, they asked, the
other poll question the other day was like who would like to see
running in two thousand and eight? And I'm like, I don't even know
who's available to run in two thousand and eight.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Dominic </SPEAKER>
Right.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's way too far ahead, and by then, you know,
the world will be completely different.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Debbie </SPEAKER>
Right, well I have no idea who should be in the cabinet.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Dominic </SPEAKER>
Yeah.  But so you voted for Bush, um again, based on
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Debbie </SPEAKER>
I voted for Bush, because when they asked during the Republican
convention,
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Dominic </SPEAKER>
um -- Mhm.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Debbie </SPEAKER>
who do you feel will keep you safer?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Dominic </SPEAKER>
Mhm.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Debbie </SPEAKER>
I did believe that I had better chance of being safer with Bush than
Kerry.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Dominic </SPEAKER>
Mhm.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Debbie </SPEAKER>
And that is why I voted for Bush.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Dominic </SPEAKER>
And not um -- And not because of the cabinet thing, although you assumed
that -- most of the cabinet would stay the same.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Debbie </SPEAKER>
Well it -- I when they're bailing out, is that telling me that they had
no confidence in him?  And that's something maybe I should have known
about, if his own people didn't have confidence in him, that I should
have voted for Kerry?  Or are they just tired of it? I mean you don't
know the reasons why they're pulling out.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Dominic </SPEAKER>
Mhm.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Debbie </SPEAKER>
So they are they sort of not publicly stating that they don't have a
voice of confidence in him, his own cabinet?  And then, if that's so,
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Dominic </SPEAKER>
Well, maybe. ((Plus he))
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Debbie </SPEAKER>
then, that makes me think again about m-
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Dominic </SPEAKER>
I'm out here in California, and we all think that Bush has you know
been deceiving the country for four years, so it isn't surprising
here.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Debbie </SPEAKER>
Mhm.  Right, that what, that his cabinet left him?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Dominic </SPEAKER>
Well, you know, that he has all this high turnover, and
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Debbie </SPEAKER>
But I don't know if that's typical with other Presidents, I don't know
in Clinton's second term, his cabinet changed so much, um
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Dominic </SPEAKER>
You know.  I don't remember that happening
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Debbie </SPEAKER>
Uh, I don't know. So I just don't know, you know, Colin Powell has
always said that he wouldn't do more than four years,
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Dominic </SPEAKER>
but
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Debbie </SPEAKER>
so I'm not sure, and some people I don't know if it's more that they
don't want to leave Bush to heal the country and make it more liberal,
he's bringing in people that are more -- pro-Kerry like -- so I'm not sure
what this whole change-up in the cabinet really means.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Dominic </SPEAKER>
I think it's just that -- the people who were in the cabinet were tired
of being in the cabinet.  So, I mean, it's even, like you know, I
think Colin Powell originally said that he was going to do it only for
four years, or something like that.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Debbie </SPEAKER>
Right.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Dominic </SPEAKER>
Um so I think it's that, and -- but I don't think that like any of his
you know cabinet replacements are -- um -- you know an improvement in you
know, by any- and it like -- I think they're you know, even more
conservative than the ones that -- are leaving.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Debbie </SPEAKER>
Right.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Dominic </SPEAKER>
Yes.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Debbie </SPEAKER>
So I don't know. So it made me nervous when they pulled out, because
I'm thinking then they should have come out publicly and said that
they are not in agreement with him.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Dominic </SPEAKER>
And -- So I don't think they're
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Debbie </SPEAKER>
I mean (()) because I didn't feel like he personally decided on the
war, I thought it was a joint decision with the information he was
being given.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Dominic </SPEAKER>
Mhm, with (()) with all his cabinet members.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Debbie </SPEAKER>
And the (()) of what these
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Dominic </SPEAKER>
You mean.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Debbie </SPEAKER>
Right, so I thought if these people, if that was the common feeling of
them all together -- but if secretly they didn't feel that way, and
that's why -- and now they're amscraying,  then that made me a little
nervous.
