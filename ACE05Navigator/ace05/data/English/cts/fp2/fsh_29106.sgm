Yeah. Yeah, um, I guess -- we're supposed to -- eh, we're supposed to
suggest, or, you know,  who we would think would be the best
candidates for both -- parties -- in two thousand eight, and they give
some suggestions -- of people who've been mentioned in the press.  Which
which I've,  um,  I've -- those are the people who've I've I I've heard.
Uh, I've heard Colin Powell -- for the Republican party. Jeb Bush and
Schwarzenegger.  And I've heard Hillary Clinton and -- Barak -- Obama who
is -- the Senator in Illinois -- for the Democrats, and -- Um, so I guess
we're supposed to say -- suggest maybe other people,  but, um,  those
are the only people that I know who -- have been talked about in the
press.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Larry </SPEAKER>
I know that Lieberman ran before, but,  you know, I really didn't know
that much about him, but -- I don't I don't think he would have a shot
as far as the Democratic, uh,  nomination, but -- he's a pretty smart
guy, and,
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Larry </SPEAKER>
um,  uh, J- I like John McCain, I mean.  I'm -- more of a Democrat than
a Republican, but -- I'm I was impressed by John McCain in -- on the
Republican side, I mean,
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
Uh-huh.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Larry </SPEAKER>
I could live with him, I think.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>

</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Larry </SPEAKER>
I I admire him, and -- and what he's done.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Larry </SPEAKER>
Uh -- Trying to think. Uh.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
Yeah, have you heard, um,  very much about Obama?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Larry </SPEAKER>
No, uh-uh.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
Okay. Yeah, he's -- he basically came out of -- nowhere -- and -- there was an
open seat for the ~US -- Senate,  and he was in the House,  uh the state
uh assembly.  So he was a state congressman, and -- the Senate seat was
open, and -- we were going to replace -- the Republican Fitzgerald -- in in
Illinois -- and uh the Republican party had a very difficult time -- uh
finding somebody who would run against Obama.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Larry </SPEAKER>
Mhm.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
And,  um,  they picked -- uh, another African American who had his own
money -- and basically wanted to get some exposure, even though they kn-
they knew they were going to lose the race.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Larry </SPEAKER>
Mhm.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
So then, Obama -- won by a landslide.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Larry </SPEAKER>
Mhm.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
And he's very young, he's um from -- his parents are Kenyan -- and
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Larry </SPEAKER>
Okay, I think I have seen him. Um,
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Larry </SPEAKER>
I I didn't know his name, but I know who you're talking about, now.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
Uh-huh.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Larry </SPEAKER>
I remember that right before the election he came,
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Larry </SPEAKER>
like,  like, thin air -- almost out of nowhere and then,  I'm not
familiar, I think was it in Chicago, or
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Larry </SPEAKER>
as another state, you know, I I don't really keep up with
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Larry </SPEAKER>
Senate races, or -- stuff like that, but I did remember hearing about
him.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Um,  yeah, so he he -- probably wouldn't the good he
probably wouldn't be a good presidential candidate because he's so
young
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Larry </SPEAKER>
Mhm.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
and this is his first term in in the Senate.  Um but he's he has a lot
of um -- political appeal. I -- I get the sense from,  um,  conservatives
and,  um,  and Democrats, old and young, that they just kind of trust
this guy, that he's a -- he's a likeable character.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Larry </SPEAKER>
Mhm.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
So, I he he will probably -- be somebody to contend with in the future,
bu- -- but I don't think in two thousand eight, that's maybe too soon.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Larry </SPEAKER>
Mhm.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
What do you think of Schwarzenegger? That seems, um,  I know Ronald
Reagan was an actor but not quite the same kind of actor as
Schwarzenegger.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Larry </SPEAKER>
Ah hell, he's pretty new to -- politics is the only thing that, uh,  y-
you know he's got to have a some kind of track record, I mean.  I mean
I like what he's done so far about this -- the way he's handling it and
just,  you know the way he's,  you know, talking to people and they
seem to understand him and and -- I don't know if there's other -- their
financial situation where they -- you know all the problems that they
had that -- got the other guy kicked out and got him in there,
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Larry </SPEAKER>
uh, it's I'm still -- I don't think it's -- been enough time to know if if
he's -- ca- I think he could do a j- good job, but he's got to have some
kind of track record and I don't think he has is there yet. Maybe
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Larry </SPEAKER>
the next election. Maybe, um,  um,  maybe in four -- more years or
something, uh,
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Larry </SPEAKER>
see how he does.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
It seems -- it seems like -- the Republicans who -- who,  uh,  well, the
the red states in the South -- and in -- the West -- the they traditionally
vote Republican,  um, no matter who who's running.  And if
Schwarzenegger carried those states and California, which is -- fifty-
two -- electoral votes,  uh, he'd have a very good chance -- um because if
you you know, if you can get the southern states and -- California, that
that's huge.  But uh yeah you're right I don't know if he has enough
experience.
