from texas politics now to chinese censorship. china today blacked out
a cnn interview that was critical of the chinese government's handling
of the sars epidemic and of the country's health care system. china
requires foreign broadcasters to use a chinese satellite to serve
their country. until last month it was routinely blocking almost all
reports about sars in china. a practice that has produced intense
global criticism. the british broadcasting company has also face the
censorship in china. in 1993 rupert murdoch bought a controlling stake
in china's star tv satellite system. in 1994 the bbc world service
broadcasts were pulled from star. china was offended by the bbc's news
content and demanded that star tv remove it or lose permission to
broadcast in china. a year later murdoch bought the rest of star tv
that he did not own. rupert murdoch's news corp. has an extensive
presence, of course in this country. that presence may be expanding
soon. if the fcc eases some of its broadcast rules. murdoch has
lobbied hard for those changes. they would allow him to buy even more
u.s. television stations. next month the fcc is likely to accommodate
him. murdoch today promised that if the rules are changed he will
limit future purchases to a few of what he calls sizable markets.
