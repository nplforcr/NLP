in the matry come of colleague from al jazeera and others.

is also very close to al jazeera surned by the u.s. forces.
the third hit was targeted to the palestine hotel where
many journalists are working and a hit of a photographer. a
specialist, people think the events are not put the media
man in face of the weapons. looking for a shelter is not
easy. the u.s. and cooperation do not appreciate the city

pentagon has been essentially all over the place. the
military spokesmen have been all over the map in
