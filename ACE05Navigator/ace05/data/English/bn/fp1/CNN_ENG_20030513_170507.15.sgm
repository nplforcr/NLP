<TURN>
well, joining us now, the chairman of the securities and
exchange commission, william donaldson. mr. chairman, it's
good to have you here.
</TURN>
<TURN>
nice to be here, lou.
</TURN>
<TURN>
let's start with that surprise, the malfeasance that is
crossing your desk. are you suggesting corporate america
has not learned its lesson yet?
</TURN>
<TURN>
well, no. i think that quote is a little out of context
there. there are a number -- there are 15,000 companies in
the united states, and i think the great bulk of them are
very honestly managed and so forth. there have been a few
-- a number of people have had egregious fraud and so
forth. there's been a general loosening of morals across
the board. what i was referring to in that quote you had
was the number of cases we see day in and day out at the
lowest levels, scams and so forth, where considerable
amounts of money are being made and lost by relatively
small investors.
</TURN>
<TURN>
is the investor today in your judgment secure?
</TURN>
<TURN>
well, i think that the -- the marketplace is becoming
increasingly secure. i think a number of the reforms that
have come via the sarbanes-oxley act and a number of things
that we have done at the sec are basically making everybody
take a new look at how they're performing their duty as a
director, how they're performing their duties on audit
committees and compensation committees and in wall street.
i think the reforms that came as a part of the large
settlement are going to change the way research and
investment banking are done to the betterment of the
individual investor.
</TURN>
<TURN>
and some people are surprised and i might even add pleased
in this city that your sec has been quick to react when
phil purcell of morgan stanley made a statement that your
sec didn't think and that you didn't think expressed
appropriate contrition when bear stearns stepped out of
line in the view of the sec. it wasn't a polite phone call
quietly made, either from your enforcement division or from
your office. it was rather public. is that the way you're
going to operate?
</TURN>
<TURN>
well, lou, we're deadly serious about bringing reform into
the marketplace. we're deadly serious about some of the
actions we've taken. and when we see people who don't
appear to be taking it too seriously, we're going to get to
them right away.
</TURN>
<TURN>
and i think perhaps no one more surprised than some of the
people running those firms on wall street. you have also
expressed concern about excessive executive compensation,
particularly ceo compensation. is there really anything
that can be done about this problem?
</TURN>
<TURN>
i think so, lou. i think the real next step here is for
compensation committees to spend a little more time than
they do on what they're really compensating for. i think
there's been too much emphasis on performance defined
strictly by stock performance and earnings per share. i
think there are a number of other measures that tell how --
or indicate how well somebody's doing running a company.
and i think corporation boards need to spend more time on
that dimension.
</TURN>
<TURN>
and with you as chairman of the sec exercising your bully
pulpit, one assumes that
