if there was any question about how the dixie chicks would
be received in america, answered last night, in part, the
band played to about 15,000 in greenville, south carolina.
their first u.s. concert since their singer natalie maines
sparked a controversy when she said she was ashamed the
president was from the state of texas. we are back on stage
looking online good.

did you talk about the dixie chicks?

nope. president bush's trip to the "uss abraham lincoln"
perhaps one of the chief -- he landed on the aircraft
carrier at a speed of about 150 miles an hour and touchdown
and came to a stop about the space of a football field. he
made a nationally televised address last night carried on
all of the networks and in an event that undoubtedly has
some of the democrats a little nausea this morning, the
president took what might be a giant first step in his
reelection campaign. he talked in the speech about the war
on terror, saying, quote it is not over, yet it is not
endless. we don't know the day of final victory, but we
have seen the turning of the tide. here is the question
this morning. it's friday, so if that question doesn't
tickle your fancy, knock yourselves out. write about
anything and we'll pick some of the best and read them
later.
