president bush says alan greenspan should serve another
term as federal reserve chairman. there was speculation
about that issue after a rift erupted over green spann's
questioning the need for mr. bush's $726 million tax cut
plan. the endorsement came as greenspan was scheduled for
surgery to treat an enlarged prostate. he is scheduled to
return to work later this week. i'm anderson cooper, those
are the headlines making news this hour. now back to "wolf
blitzer reports." for the first time in decade, shi'a
muslims are freely making a pilgrimage to the holy city of
car bal a. they are using the new freedom to express
disdain for the country that wanted it for them. our senior
international correspondent nic robertson is joining us
live from karbala. nic, how much anger is there towards the
united states in these pilgrimage demonstrations? the
majority most people here are very happy, they're very
peaceful here. they say they're very grateful to the united
states, but some of them do express with quite extreme
anger because they believe the united states wants to stay
here, wants to exploit iraq in their view. they express
quite extreme anger that the united states and the
coalition forces should leave iraq. the vast majority of
people, however, do not talk a lot about that if you ask
them questions about it, yes. they will tell you the united
states has done a very good job, but it's time to leave and
what we are hearing now that a returning exiled route
called the supreme council for islamic revolution in iraq
is sending a delegation here from iran where they've been
in exile for several decades, sending a delegation here
tomorrow. that delegation will bring a message of sheer
unity. it will bring a message of rebuilding iraq along
islamic lines. it will bring a message of inter29ing and a
rejection of international involvement in iraq. wolf?
