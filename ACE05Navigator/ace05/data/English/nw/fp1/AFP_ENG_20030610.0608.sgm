ImClone founder sentenced to more than seven years in prison

NEW YORK, June 10 (AFP)

Sam Waksal, the founder of biotech firm ImClone, was sentenced to
seven years and three months in prison on Tuesday for his central
role in an insider trading scandal.

The prison time, along with a four-million-dollar fine, was handed
down eight months after Waksal, 55, pleaded guilty to six charges of
a 13-count indictment, including bank fraud, securities fraud and
conspiracy to obstruct justice.

Waksal admitted tipping off his daughter to sell ImClone stock before
an announcement by the Food and Drug Administration that it was
rejecting his company's cancer drug, Erbitux.

During the sentencing hearing, Waksal's lawyer had appealed for
leniency, saying his client's life had already been ruined by the
scandal, which has also implicated homemaking celebrity Martha
Stewart.

But Judge William Pauley brushed aside those appeals.

"You abused your position of trust as CEO of a major corporation, and
have undermined public confidence in the financial market," Pauley
said. "And then you tried to lie your way out of it and even
jeopardised the welfare of members of your family for your own
selfish gains."

Prior to sentencing, Waksal had apologised to his family and his
employees at ImClone.

As an inmate in the federal prison system, Waksal will not be
eligible for parole and will have to serve the entirety of his
sentence.

He was not jailed immediately, but ordered to surrender to the
authorities on July 2. In the meantime, he must wear an electronic
bracelet under virtual house arrest in his Manhattan apartment.

The ImClone scandal has also resulted in the indictment of Martha
Stewart, a friend of Waksal's and founder of the lifestyle business
empire, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia.

Stewart, 61, pleaded not guilty in court last Wednesday to charges of
conspiracy, obstruction of justice and securities fraud.

The indictment accused Stewart of selling 4,000 shares of ImClone's
stock after receiving an illegal tip about the FDA's decision on
Erbitux.
