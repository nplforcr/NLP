Fourteen Iraqis, the first handful of official refugees from that
war-besieged land, crossed the Syrian border on Sunday northwest of
Mosul, a northern Iraqi city under U.S. bombardment, the U.N. refugee
agency reported.

The group, crossing at Al Yarubiyah, Syria, was transferred to the
U.N. refugee agency's camp at El Hol, 100 kilometers (60 miles) to
the west, agency spokesman Peter Kessler said in Amman.

An expected exodus of refugees from Iraq has not yet materialized in
the four-day-old war. In the north, particularly, thousands have left
embattled cities, but they're not crossing international borders,
Kessler said.

``People seem to be sticking close to their communities of origin,''
he said.

Hundreds of people from third countries fleeing the fighting,
particularly Sudanese, Egyptians and Moroccans, have arrived at the
Jordanian border, U.N. officials say. But no Iraqis have sought
international relief help except at the Syrian border. ``This was the
first confirmed report of Iraqi refugee arrivals,'' Kessler said.

Tens of thousands of apparently better-off Iraqis are reported to
have crossed into Syria in recent weeks but have not sought
assistance. They instead moved in with friends or are renting homes
for the duration of the war, reports say.   (cjh-pfg)
