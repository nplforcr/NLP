British Airways cancels stopovers in Saudi Arabia

LONDON, May 14 (Xinhua)

British Airways (BA) announced on Wednesday it had canceled stopovers
for its air crews in Saudi Arabia following a change in the British
government's travel advice after the suicide blasts in the Saudi
capital of Riyadh.

A spokeswoman for Europe's biggest airline said the decision to stop
using hotels in Riyadh and Jeddah and instead lodge crew in Larnaca,
Cyprus was taken after the British Foreign Office advised on Tuesday
against non-essential travel to Saudi Arabia.

"Our cabin and flight crews will stay overnight in Larnaca as they
did during the (Iraq) war," said the spokeswoman, adding that BA
would continue direct flights to both Saudi cities from London, but
return flights would be via Larnaca.

At least 34 people, including up to 10 Americans, were killed Monday
night when suspected al-Qaeda suicide bombers shot their way into
housing compounds in Riyadh, hours before US Secretary of State Colin
Powell was due to visit.

A Briton was confirmed dead from the suicide bombings, during which
another 15 Britons, including a 15-year-old girl, are believed to
have been injured.

The Foreign Office said earlier Wednesday that two British nationals
were still unaccounted for after the blasts.
