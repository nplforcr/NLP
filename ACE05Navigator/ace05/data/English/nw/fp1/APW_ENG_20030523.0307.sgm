Israeli Cabinet to discuss road map plan on Sunday

JERUSALEM (AP)

The Israeli Cabinet will discuss a U.S.-backed ``road map'' to
Mideast peace on Sunday, taking a first step toward a formal response
after weeks of hesitation, officials said after the White House
announced it would take Israeli reservations about the plan into
account.

It was not clear whether the Cabinet would also vote on the plan
Sunday.

In the Gaza Strip, meanwhile, Hamas attacked an Israeli bus with
explosives Friday  _  an apparent challenge to Palestinian Prime
Minister Mahmoud Abbas, who a day earlier had asked the Islamic
militant group to halt attacks against Israelis.

Hamas told Abbas it would consider stopping attacks on civilians in
Israel, but would continue targeting Israeli settlers and soldiers in
the West Bank and Gaza. Israel has said it would not accept a partial
truce.

Friday's bus attack, the fifth Hamas bombing in a week, injured two
people and underscored the challenges facing Abbas in implementing
the road map. The plan which calls for an immediate end to violence,
the dismantling of some Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip and the creation of a Palestinian state by 2005.

The Palestinians have accepted the plan, while Israel has expressed
major reservations.

Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon told the White House through an
emissary earlier this week that he would go along with the road map
as long as the United States took Israel's concerns into account.

The White House announced Friday that it will consider ``fully and
seriously'' Israel's objections, and that the United States ``shares
the view of the government of Israel that these are real concerns.''

The joint statement from U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell and
National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice seemed to open the door to
slightly revising the plan. Powell, however, told a news conference
in Paris on Friday that, ``With respect to the road map, we're not
planning on making any changes.''

Palestinian Information Minister Nabil Amr said Friday that the
Palestinians were ready to ``start the implementation process
immediately.'' He said the Palestinians had received American
assurances that there would be no changes in the plan.

An Israeli government official said the Israeli Cabinet would discuss
the plan on Sunday, a first step toward a formal Israeli response.
Sharon faces stiff opposition from hardliners, including many members
of his own Cabinet and Jewish settler leaders.

The settlers' umbrella organization asked Sharon on Friday not to
endorse the road map, saying ``acceptance of the map ... is likely to
be interpreted as a prize for terror.''

One major obstacle to adopting the road map is a disagreement between
Sharon and Abbas over how to deal with Palestinian militant groups
that carried out scores of shootings and bombings in the past 32
months of fighting. Abbas wants to persuade militants to lay down
their arms, while Sharon insists they be disarmed and arrested.

Abbas summoned Hamas leaders to his Gaza City office Thursday evening
in his first visible effort to help end attacks on Israeli civilians.

Abbas is trying to avoid using force against the militias, in part
because he may not have enough of a power base to risk a full-fledged
confrontation. Hamas has grown in popularity in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip, where many Palestinians are embittered by Israeli
military strikes and travel bans that cause much hardship.

Palestinian Cabinet Minister Ziad Abu Amr, who participated in the
meeting, said using force against the militants ``would be
counterproductive.''

Earlier this week, Hamas and other Palestinian militias carried out
five suicide bombings that killed 12 Israelis and wounded dozens. Abu
Amr said the militants apparently unleashed these attacks, in part,
because they wanted to begin truce talks from a position of strength.

The bus attacked Friday was en route from the Jewish settlement of
Netzarim in central Gaza to Israel, with 15 people on board, when the
explosion went off.

Hamas claimed responsibility during a rally in the Gaza refugee camp
of Jabaliya, saying it had targeted the bus with a pipe bomb. The
Israeli military said the explosion came from a ``roadside bomb.''

Following the attack, the Israeli army fired tank shells near
neighboring Palestinian areas, and soldiers began searching farms,
according to residents.

Also Friday, the Israeli military destroyed a house belonging to the
family of Hiba Daraghmeh, the 19-year-old bomber who killed herself
and three Israelis Monday in a suicide attack outside a shopping mall
in the northern Israeli city of Afula. Nine others lived in the house
in the village of Tubas, northeast of the West Bank city of Nablus.

U.S. President George W. Bush is considering a three-way meeting with
Sharon and Abbas in Egypt to prod them into implementing the road
map, officials involved in the planning said Thursday.

However, the meeting would only occur if both sides take steps toward
peace in the coming days, a senior Bush administration said on
condition of anonymity.   (lja-kl)
