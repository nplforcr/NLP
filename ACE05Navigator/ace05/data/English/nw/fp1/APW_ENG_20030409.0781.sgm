Security Council debates North Korea's withdrawal from nuclear treaty
</HEADLINE>

UNITED NATIONS (AP)

The U.N. Security Council refused to act on a U.S. request to condemn
North Korea for pulling out of a treaty to curb nuclear weapons
because of strong opposition from China and Russia.

But U.S. Ambassador John Negroponte called the council's expression
of concern on Wednesday ``an acceptable outcome'' at a time of
intense efforts to find a diplomatic solution.

He expressed hope that North Korea ``will not reject diplomatic
efforts to address its nuclear program'' and warned Pyongyang against
any ``further escalatory steps.''

At the heart of the dispute is North Korea's insistence on direct
talks with the United States which it views as a threat to its
security. The Bush administration, which included North Korea in its
``axis of evil,'' insists that the problem be addressed in a
multilateral forum including countries threatened by Pyongyang's
nuclear program.

China, Russia, the European Union and Secretary-General Kofi Annan
have tried to get North Korea and the United States to the
negotiating table.

U.N. envoy Maurice Strong, who just returned from Pyongyang, said
Tuesday ``sufficient progress'' has been made in bridging the gap
between the sides and there is now no reason to delay talks. He said
both sides now agree that there should be direct and multilateral
talks, but there is no agreement yet on the format.

North Korea has warned that any Security Council action would
undermine peace efforts and it has reiterated several times that it
would regard U.N. sanctions as a declaration of war.

With such high stakes, council members chose to take no action, in
hopes of finding an acceptable framework for talks.

``Members of the council expressed their concern'' about the nuclear
issue, Mexico's U.N. Ambassador Adolfo Aguilar Zinser, the current
council president, said at the end of the meeting. ``The council will
continue to follow up developments of this matter. There is nothing
else to add to this.''

China's Foreign Ministry said Tuesday the Security Council had no
business discussing North Korea's nuclear program.

As he hurriedly left Wednesday's meeting, China's U.N. Ambassador
Wang Yingfan said, ``I think it was a good discussion. All the
efforts are being done, and will continue, to promote political
dialogue  _  that's what I stressed.''

Russia's U.N. Ambassador Sergey Lavrov said ``The only way the
problem is going to be solved is direct bilateral dialogue between
Washington and Pyongyang, and whatever multilateral formats are used
should be in addition to this.''

The standoff began in October when U.S. officials said North Korea
admitted it had a clandestine nuclear program. North Korea's U.N.
Ambassador Pak Gil Yon has insisted that was a U.S. ``rumor.''

In response, Washington suspended fuel shipments that were part of a
1994 agreement with the United States that froze North Korea's
nuclear program. The North retaliated for the fuel cutoff  _ critical
to its heating and electricity supply  _  by expelling U.N. nuclear
monitors.

It then withdrew from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and took
steps to restart its frozen nuclear program, saying for the moment it
would be limited to peaceful purposes such as electricity production.

The International Atomic Energy Agency referred the issue of North
Korea's withdrawal to the council in February, saying the North was
not complying with nuclear agreements. Pyongyang's withdrawal takes
effect Thursday.

The United States wanted the council to agree on a formal statement
condemning North Korea for withdrawing from the treaty. But Russia's
Lavrov said, ``condemnations will not help.''

Even though the council did not agree on a statement, Negroponte said
the outcome of Wednesday's meeting was ``acceptable'' in view of the
efforts to find a diplomatic solution.

``Diplomatic contacts ... are taking place bilaterally,
multilaterally, between all the countries in the region around the
Korean peninsula  _  China, Japan, South Korea and so forth,'' he
said.

According to Japan's Kyodo news agency, the United States and North
Korea held working-level talks over three days last week.

Negroponte stressed that the United States doesn't only want North
Korea to give up its nuclear weapons ambitions.

``North Korea must also accept a reliable verification regime,'' he
said. ``This would include cooperation, declarations, inspections and
monitoring.''

While Negroponte stressed that the United States seeks a peaceful
solution, he said: ``I don't think we rule out the possibility of
action by the council in the future. We haven't taken any option off
the table.''

On Wednesday, North Korea warned Japan against raising tensions in
the region, saying Japan was within range of the communist state's
missiles.

``Japan should behave with discretion, clearly mindful that it is
also within the striking range of the DPRK,'' said Pyongyang's
official news agency KCNA, using the initials of North Korea's
official name, Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

The news agency charged that Japan's launch of its first spy
satellites last month proved there was a revival of ``militarism'' in
Japan. Japan's satellite program was prompted by the 1998 launch of a
North Korean Taepodong ballistic missile that flew over Japan and
crashed into the Pacific Ocean just short of Alaska.

South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun will meet U.S. President George
W. Bush on May 14 to discuss a peaceful resolution to the nuclear
issue, a statement from Roh's office said Wednesday.
