TEHRAN, April 5 (Xinhua)

Visiting Spanish Foreign Minister Ana Palacio said on Saturday that
great importance should be attached to a role to be played by the
United Nations in post- Saddam Iraq.

During talks with her Iranian counterpart Kamal Kharazi on bilateral
ties and regional developments, Palacio stressed that the United
Nations should play a main role in post-war reconstruction in the
war-torn Iraq, local press reported.

Humanitarian assistance to the Iraqi people figured high on the
agenda of the talks.

The Spanish government has planned to grant an aid package of 20
million euros (21.4 US dollars) to be divided evenly among Iran,
Jordan, Syria and Turkey to provide shelters for possible Iraqi
refugees flocking to those countries.

Palacio arrived here Friday night for discussions with Iranian
officials on offering aid to Iraqi refugees.

The Spanish foreign minister is expected to meet with Iranian
President Mohammad Khatami later in the day.

Defying international opposition, the United States and Britain
launched a war against Iraq on March 20 under the pretext of
disarming Iraq of weapons of mass destruction.

Iraq has denounced the invaders as "criminals" and "villains," while
urging the international community to stop the "aggression"
unconditionally.
