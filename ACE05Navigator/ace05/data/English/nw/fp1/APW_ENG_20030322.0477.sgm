U.S., British forces edge closer to Iraq's toughest defenders,
besiege southern city of Basra

SOUTHERN IRAQ (AP)

Edging closer to engagement with Iraq's hard-core defenders, U.S. and
British forces besieged the southern city of Basra on Saturday and
pounded Baghdad with impunity in the first daylight air raids of the
war. Diplomatic complications with Turkey closed off the option of a
heavy invasion from the north.

Allies boasted ``the instruments of tyranny are collapsing,'' and so,
from all appearances, was the will to fight among thousands in the
regular Iraqi army. Still, resistance in some areas was fierce.

On the approaches of Basra, a city of 1.3 million where Saddam
Hussein's tough security forces were thought to be lodged, allies
captured the airport in a gunbattle and took a bridge.

Ground forces were halfway to Baghdad on Saturday, about 150 miles
(240 kilometers) into Iraqi territory.

Near Basra, Cobra attack helicopters, attack jets, tanks and 155 mm
howitzers fought ahead of the troops to clear Highway 80. The road
was nicknamed Highway of Death during the 1991 Gulf War because of an
American air assault so devastating and graphic that it even gave
U.S. officials pause.

``The attack continues as we speak, and has already moved the
distance of the longest maneuver in the 1991 Gulf War in a quarter of
the time,'' U.S. Brig. Gen. Vince Brooks said.

The fate of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein remained unknown to the
U.S. and British officials trying to kill him.

``Actually, I don't know if he's alive or not,'' U.S. Gen. Tommy
Franks, the war commander, said Saturday.

Saddam was shown on Iraqi TV again Saturday but there was no telling
when the tape was made.

U.S. officials had no new, credible intelligence showing whether he
had survived assaults on his compounds, or whether he might have been
wounded, as has been speculated.

But a U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said another
senior Iraqi leader was known to be alive and might be running some
of Iraq's defenses: Saddam's cousin Ali Hassan al-Majid al-Tikriti.

He is known to his enemies as ``Chemical Ali'' for leading deadly
1988 attacks against rebellious Kurds that included chemical weapons.

Any thought the allies would limit air attacks to the cover of
darkness vanished in the smoky sunlight Saturday.

A dozen huge columns of smoke rose along Baghdad's southern horizon
in the afternoon and intermittent explosions were heard through the
capital.

But when darkness did fall, the intensity picked up. Strong blasts
rocked the capital. Warplanes were heard overhead once again.

Sickened by the escalation of a campaign they already opposed,
demonstrators rallied worldwide to give voice to their rage. Even so,
crowds were smaller than before the conflict started.

``We don't want to see more innocent people die,'' said Susan Sonz,
who joined tens of thousands marching down Broadway in New York City.
Tens of thousands of people marched in France, too, some holding
rainbow-hued peace flags and others shouting ``Bush, murderer,''
referring to U.S. President George W. Bush

Italian protests were marked by smashed windows in Milan and
vandalized gas stations in Rome.

After weeks of recalcitrance by Turkish leaders, U.S. military
officials gave up on the idea of using Turkish bases to move heavy
armored forces into northern Iraq, and redirected ships loaded with
the weaponry to the Gulf.

The United States wanted to be in position in northern Iraq not only
for war purposes but to discourage a feared conflict between Turkish
forces and Iraqi Kurds.

In Baghdad, an earlier round of bombing laid waste to presidential
palaces, government offices and military headquarters. Three people
died in that bombardment, Iraqi officials said Saturday. They said
more than 200 were injured.

West of Baghdad, along the Euphrates River, another of Saddam's
palaces was destroyed Saturday in a strike by warplanes from the USS
Theodore Roosevelt, according to a commander aboard the carrier in
the Mediterranean.

And in the far north, U.S. forces fired Tomahawk cruise missiles at
suspected positions of Ansar al Islam guerrillas, accused of having
ties to al-Qaida terrorists.

An apparent car bomb killed at least five people, including
Australian cameraman Paul Moran, 39, a freelance cameraman working
for the Australian Broadcasting Corp., at a road checkpoint near an
Ansar al Islam encampment. Eight people were wounded.

Neighboring Iran protested hits on Iranian territory by at least
three U.S. missiles. The State Department, through Swiss
intermediaries, told Tehran that the United States was investigating
and respected Iran's territorial integrity.

Diplomatic fallout from the U.S.-led occupation of southern Iraq
extended to Moscow, where of trying to seize Iraq's oil wealth under
the guise of liberating the country.

Saddam's security forces in Basra  _  Iraq's main seaport and second
largest city  _  opened up with artillery and heavy machine guns.
Facing the prospect of urban warfare, allied commanders hoped to win
the surrender of their enemy rather than have to overpower the city.

``Military commanders do not engage in urban areas unless they have
to,'' said British military spokesman Lt. Col. Chris Vernon. The
British took charge of the Basra fighting Saturday as U.S. Marines
pressed north.

Troops fought for two days at the port of Umm Qasr, but officials
couldn't confirm it was secured. Vernon said some Iraqi combatants
had slipped into civilian garb and become guerillas.

Bush convened a wartime national security meeting at the Camp David,
Maryland, presidential retreat.

``Our cause is just  _	the security of the nations we serve and the
peace of the world,'' Bush said in his weekly radio address. ``And
our mission is clear  _  to disarm Iraq of weapons of mass
destruction, to end Saddam Hussein's support for terrorism and to
free the Iraqi people.''

Franks, from his regional command post in Qatar, said coalition
forces had not located any weapons of mass destruction.
