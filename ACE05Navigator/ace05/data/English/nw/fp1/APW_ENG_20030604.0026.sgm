Officials say U.S. close to basing troops in Balkans, considers
cutting force in Germany

U.S. troops may soon use Balkans bases for training sites and staging
points for possible interventions in the Middle East as the Pentagon
weighs withdrawing 15,000 soldiers from Germany, diplomats and
government officials in Europe say.

Speculation about U.S. bases in newly democratic eastern Europe began
months ago with NATO's decision to expand membership to the former
Soviet bloc. On a recent stop in Bulgaria, which joins next year,
Gen. Charles Wald, deputy U.S. Army commander in Europe, said that
``as NATO moves east our presence and our participation will have to
be where NATO is.''

But Balkan bases first used by the Americans during the Iraq war may
get a full-time U.S. presence even before the official NATO
expansion, said Western diplomats and local officials, who agreed to
discuss the situation on condition of anonymity.

They said the Pentagon wants to use big Romanian and Bulgarian
training grounds in year-round programs that would have up to 3,000
battle-ready U.S. soldiers here at any time. Speaking separately, two
diplomats said such training could begin ``within months, not
years.''

None of those who spoke about the possible bases reported any formal
agreement, but they indicated the parties were discussing the details
of allowing U.S. military bases in the two countries. Legislation
would be needed to implement such agreements.

Asked about the comments, a Pentagon spokesman in Washington, Lt. Dan
Hetlage, said Tuesday that no decisions had been made on using the
bases.

The idea is for the U.S. troops  _  infantry, artillery, light armor
and helicopters  _  to undergo intense training of 30-90 days, then
return to bases in western Europe or the United States, the sources
said.

But the diplomats and officials said the troops would also be ready
for quick movement to trouble spots in the Middle East or Central
Asia.

Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and other Pentagon officials
have said they are studying how to shift U.S. troops around the world
to respond to new threats such as terrorism.

``This is probably the closest point in Europe to the sort of threat
which is centered in the areas of Central Asia, (or) the (Persian)
Gulf,'' Romanian Defense Minister Ioan Mircea Pascu said in an
interview.

Bulgarian Foreign Minister Solomon Pasi told The Associated Press
that the region also is a good jumping off point for fighting
international terrorist groups, ``an enemy hidden somewhere, without
a capital, without a face, without a government.''

In Romania, the Americans are interested in the Mihail Kogalniceanu
air base, the Babadag training range and the Black Sea military port
of Mangalia. In Bulgaria, talks are focusing on the use of the
Sarafovo and Graf Ignatievo military airports and the Koren and Novo
Selo training areas.

Lt. Cmdr Rick Haupt, a spokesman for U.S. European Command in
Stuttgart, Germany, said consideration of the Balkans for training
was part of Rumsfeld's ``larger vision to transform the military into
a more agile force.''

While not directly linked, the idea for Balkans bases and the
possible withdrawal of nearly a quarter of the 80,000 U.S. military
personnel in Germany appear connected by shifting strategic and
political considerations.

U.S. forces were reduced after the Cold War ended, and further cuts
in central and western Europe make economic and strategic sense.
Adding to the case for rebasing is American unhappiness over German
and French opposition to the war in Iraq while the governments of the
ex-communist countries supported Washington, providing moral and some
military support.

U.S. officials speaking on the record deny there are firm plans to
pull troops from Germany. But senior diplomats and officials say
privately that it is being considered. A ranking diplomat with deep
knowledge of U.S. plans said he knew of no firm time frame, but ``a
lot of them will be going home.''

A senior Romanian official in regular contact with ranking U.S.
officials said he was told 15,000 Americans would be withdrawn from
Germany in the foreseeable future. ``They would be welcome here,''
the official said.

At the Mihail Kogalniceanu air base, U.S. contracts have paid for
Romanian crews to resurface and widen two roads, build a third and
improve landing areas to accommodate the Americans' largest planes.

Existing accommodations for up to 6,000 service personnel also have
been upgraded with central heating and other amenities, said Col.
Victor Luchian, the Romanian commander of the base.

About 3,000 Americans, including special operations units, were at
the base during the Iraq war, flying troops and weapons directly to
the front.

Luchian said that most of them would be gone soon, but that a small
crew would remain for maintenance. He shrugged when asked how long
they would stay.

A senior diplomat was more direct on the American presence. ``They'll
never go home,'' he said.
