Planet Hollywood CEO, Starwood venture to buy bankrupt Aladdin casino

LAS VEGAS (AP)

Aladdin Gaming LLC has agreed to sell its bankrupt Las Vegas
casino-hotel to a joint venture involving Planet Hollywood's
co-founder and the Starwood hotel chain.

The deal announced Wednesday calls for the Arabian Nights-themed
resort on the Las Vegas Strip to be branded as Planet Hollywood Hotel
&amp; Casino. The property will be managed by Starwood Hotels &amp;
Resorts Inc. through its Sheraton hotel brand. Planet Hollywood CEO
Robert Earl and New York investment firm Bay Harbour Management LC
also are members of a member of the venture.

The group also is buying Aladdin's 7,000-seat Theatre of Performing
Arts.

``We've dealt with a lot of different people,'' Aladdin president and
acting chief executive Bill Timmins said in an interview. ``This is
the entity that we wish to go forward with.''

As part of the deal the venture will assume $510 million of Aladdin
debt and other liabilities. The trio also will invest $90 million in
the casino.

The 2,567-room Aladdin opened in August 2000 and filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection in September 2001. The deal has to be approved
by a bankruptcy judge, who can allow other companies to bid.

The deal includes buying the $35 million Northwind Aladdin power
plant on Aladdin property that provides the property with hot and
cold water and a backup generator. The company agreed to retain all
2,600 employees.

Planet Hollywood, which has no role in the bid, said it would exhibit
movie and television memorabilia. Starwood will manage hotel
operations through its Sheraton brand.

Earl, co-founder of Planet Hollywood, said the casino would assume a
new identity.

``There will be a complete new look to the facade,'' he said. ``There
will be significant construction to the property and improved entry
ways.''

Mike Mecca, former general manager of the Green Valley Ranch
hotel-casino in Henderson, will serve as president and chief
executive officer.

Starwood, under its Starwood Vacation Ownership division, could also
develop 600 time-share units on Aladdin property. The purchase does
not include the adjoining Desert Passage Mall, which is owned by
Aladdin Bazaar.

Marc Falcone, a Deutsche Bank gambling analyst in New York, said the
selling price for the hotel-casino was fair.

``I don't think they are overpaying,'' he said. ``I think the bond
holders should be happy. We think it will be another strong addition
to the marketplace.''	    _	_  _  =
