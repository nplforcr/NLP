Roadmap boosted by Israeli troop pullbacks, truce

ATTENTION - ADDS Temple Mount visits ///

GAZA CITY, June 30 (AFP) - Israeli forces staged a partial withdrawal
from Gaza on Monday as an armed offshoot of Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat's Fatah movement agreed to a truce in a major boost for the
US-backed peace roadmap.

Palestinian security forces returned to the positions they held in
the Gaza Strip before the outbreak of the 33-month-old uprising, as
Israel removed all major checkpoints in the coastal territory.

As part of their withdrawal, Israeli troops also returned control of
Gaza's main highway following a truce declaration late Sunday by four
Palestinian militant groups, marking the first major progress under
the roadmap aimed at creating a lasting peace.

Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, an armed offshoot of Fatah, later became
the fifth group to pledge to respect the ceasefire, but a foreign
worker was shot in the West Bank in a attack claimed by one of its
branches.

Governments worldwide hailed the truce, including the United States,
which said it hoped a "new era" was dawning in the Middle East.

A Palestinian security source said police officers took up their
positions across the Gaza Strip.

"Palestinian police have taken over all the posts and positions they
held before September 28, 2000. It is the first time they have had
freedom of movement with cars and weapons since the start of the
intifada," he said.

Israeli troops withdrew overnight from the northern Gaza town of Beit
Hanun and Palestinian police took up positions there and in the
neighbouring town of Beit Lahiya.

The army stormed Beit Hanun two months ago to crush militant groups
and prevent them from launching rocket attacks on nearby Israeli
communities. Palestinian security forces are now committed to
preventing militants from launching attacks from the area.

Meanwhile, traffic flowed freely for the first time in years through
the Netzarim junction, just south of Gaza City, the Kissufim junction
by central Deir al-Balah, and the Guest House junction just south of
Deir al-Balah.

The three military checkpoints on the highway, which runs the entire
length of the Gaza Strip, had transformed the trip from north to
south, ordinarily a 30-minute ride, into a grinding two or three-hour
ordeal which came to symbolise the occupation.

Further south, Israeli troops allowed six Palestinian police officers
to return to the Palestinian section of the border crossing with
Egypt, which had  been taken over by Israeli troops at the start of
the intifada.

A senior Palestinian security official also told AFP that the Israeli
army has agreed at a meeting on Monday to withdraw from the southern
West Bank town of Bethlehem and its surrounding area on Wednesday.

Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon was also to meet with his
Palestinian counterpart Mahmud Abbas in Jerusalem on Tuesday to
discuss further implementation of the roadmap, Israeli public radio
reported.

Sharon confirmed he had asked the Shin Beth domestic intelligence
service to provide him with a detailed list of Palestinian prisoners
to determine which ones could be released as per the demands of the
Palestinian factions.

The Israel redeployments come after the two most hardline groups
fighting Israel -- Hamas and Islamic Jihad -- issued a joint
statement Sunday declaring a three-month ceasefire, but listing
several conditions, including an end to attacks against their members
and the release of Palestinian prisoners.

They were followed hours later by the Fatah party of Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat and the leftist Democratic Front for the
Liberation of Palestine.

In the first act of bloodshed since the declarations, a 45-year-old
Bulgarian was shot dead while driving a truck near the northern West
Bank town of Jenin, the Israeli army and sources close to the Jewish
settlers said.

A member of Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades claimed the killing in a
telephone call to AFP and said it was a direct challenge to the
authority of Fatah.

But in a statement the group undertook "to respect the position of
the (Fatah) movement which is calling for a temporary and conditional
truce."

Six political factions falling under the umbrella of the Palestine
Liberation Organization (PLO) also said in a statement they would
heed the call by Fatah "for a halt to all military actions for a
period of six months."

None of the groups has an armed wing.

But Israel reacted with disdain to the ceasefire declarations and
warned it would only deal with the Palestinian Authority.

Despite Israel's frosty reception, governments worldwide, including
the United States, hailed the truce.

"We're entering a new era now, hopefully," White House spokesman Ari
Fleischer said after US President George W. Bush heard by telephone
from national security adviser Condoleezza Rice about her
just-finished trip to the region.

But he renewed the US warning that the Palestinians still needed to
dismantle "terrorist infrastructures."

"It remains the president's very strong position that it's important
to dismantle terrorism," Fleischer said. "The terrorists are the
greatest threat that the Palestinian people have to receiving a
state."

Senior officials of Hamas and Islamic Jihad also said Israel's
pullout of the northern Gaza Strip was not enough and stressed armed
struggle remained their strategy.

Israeli military army, meanwhile, reported that Israelis and foreign
tourists have recently been allowed to visit the Temple Mount
compound, or the al-Aqsa Mosque compound, for the first time since
the start of the intifada.

Authorization for the visits by about 20 groups over the past several
weeks came from Sharon, the internal security minister, Tzahi
Hanegbi, and the police, it said.

The intifada broke out after a controversial visit to the site by
Sharon.
