Algerians quake kills 1,600 but two-year-old saved in small miracle

CORSO, Algeria (AP)

A pall of death, loss and pain that settled on Algeria two days after
a devastating earthquake lifted briefly Friday as a 2-year-old girl
emerged alive from the rubble of her crumbled building, spared by the
caprices of fate.

Drawn by constant cries, volunteer rescue workers from Spain
scrambled to extract Emilie Kaidi from her collapsed ground floor
bedroom in Corso, one of the hardest hit areas east of Algiers.

Emilie's parents survived the Wednesday evening earthquake that
destroyed their town. However, older sister, 4-year-old Lisa, has not
been found.

Fate favored Emilie, who was protected underneath a door that had
fallen on a television set.

There were not many such happy endings elsewhere.

Villagers suffering from rising shortages of food, drinkable water
and electricity accused the government on Friday of a weak response
to the earthquake, and countries around the world rushed to fill the
gap.

``We have only our hands and hammers,'' said Ismail Lizir, 42, also
of Corso, one of the towns destroyed by Wednesday night's killer
earthquake. ``It's been nearly three days, and there has been no sign
of local authorities.''

The 6.8-magnitude quake tore through the area east of Algiers,
killing more than 1,600 people and leaving 7,207 injured. With heavy
machinery in short supply and countless bodies still under rubble,
the death toll was expected to rise further.

Villagers in destroyed towns like Corso said they lacked just about
everything  _  food, medicine, blankets. Heavy machinery needed to
dig survivors and bodies out of the rubble was nonexistent in many
areas, townspeople said.

Some villagers said the lack of outside help inflated the death toll.
Left to their own devices, townspeople struggled in vain to move huge
slabs of cement with their bare hands or shovels, their dying loved
ones just meters (yards) away.

However, Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia said in Algiers that heavy
machinery could not be used as long as their was hope of finding
survivors.

The prime minister announced 700,000 dinars (US$7,000) in aid for
victims and housing for those whose homes are declared uninhabitable.

``Nobody has visited us, not even to establish a death count,'' said
Yoscef Manel, 34, who earns a living by doing odd jobs. ``Helicopters
flew overhead and the interior minister drove through, but it's noise
for nothing.''

The government struggled to respond, moving dozens of ambulances,
3,000 police and security agents and electrical workers into the
quake zone. The army was helping with tents, ambulances and
engineering equipment, and water trucks were making the rounds to
stricken villages.

But the disaster is far beyond Algeria's ability to cope, and other
countries pitched in. Germany promised a field hospital, Sweden and
Switzerland sent sniffer dogs, Russia dispatched rescue experts.
Turkey pitched in with a search team, tents and medicine.

U.S. President George W. Bush called Algerian President Abdelaziz
Bouteflika on Friday, the official APS news agency reported, saying
Bush assured Bouteflika of ``the support and friendship of the United
States.''

Rescuers started saying Friday that chances were slim of digging out
more survivors.

Saa Sayah, a captain in Algeria's civil protection unit, said
rescuers had already stopped listening for voices of the living, but
instead were being guided by the scent of decaying bodies.

``There is not much hope here,'' he said in front of a large,
four-story building that had collapsed in Boumerdes. ``We have
already pulled up four bodies, but we can't get further inside.''

The region of Boumerdes, 48 kilometers (30 miles) east of Algiers,
was the hardest hit. APS, quoting the Interior Ministry, reported
that 955 people died there.

Villagers were making do with whatever was available. In Corso, where
the quake flattened the bakeries and food was running low, a
pharmacist dumped her stocks of medicines onto the pavement where
volunteers were sorting them out and distributing them.

``We are giving them away to those who need them,'' said Malek
Fadalia. ``You can't make people pay at a time like this. People are
dying.''

In Algiers and across the damaged area, many woke up in streets and
public parks Friday after spending the night outdoors, fearful of
continuing aftershocks that could topple the buildings still left
standing. Police were on heightened alert to stop thieves from
looting abandoned homes.

Victims' bodies were wrapped in blankets and plastic bags at morgues.
Townspeople searching for missing relatives covered their faces
against the stench of decay as they moved from body to body, lifting
the blankets to look at the faces of the dead.

The quake hit about 7:45 p.m. Wednesday, with its epicenter east of
Algiers. The 6.8-magnitude quake was the North African nation's
deadliest since a pair of temblors west of the capital killed up to
5,000 in October 1980, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.

The temblor also ruptured underwater cables, cutting phone links to
Algeria and seriously disrupting international communications with
countries in Asia, the Middle East and the Pacific, France Telecom
said.

For Algeria, the quake carried risks of political aftershocks, too.

The government has been battling Islamic insurgents for more than a
decade and, with elections due next year, support for President
Abdelaziz Bouteflika could slide if efforts to help quake survivors
flag.

Muslim fundamentalists have traditionally excelled in helping the
needy. To oversee rescue efforts, Bouteflika canceled plans to join a
summit of world leaders in France next week, APS reported.

Many Algerians have complained about the wobbly state of buildings
and a housing shortage in a country rich in oil and natural gas. In a
suburb of the capital, residents have said it is not uncommon for
three families	_  roughly 14 people  _  to cram into a three-bedroom
apartment; others sleep in hallways each night.

In Corso, a row of 14 identical apartment houses that townspeople
said were built by the same construction company in the mid-1980s
collapsed in useless heaps while older buildings withstood the quake.
Many people were crushed while trying to run down the stairwells to
safety.

The U.S. Geological Survey, which monitors quakes around the world,
said the temblor had a preliminary magnitude of 6.8.
