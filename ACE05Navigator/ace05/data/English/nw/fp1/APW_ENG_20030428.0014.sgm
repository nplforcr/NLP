North Korea tells South to stay off nuclear dispute

SEOUL, South Korea (AP)

North Korea told South Korea on Monday that it should not meddle in a
standoff over the communist North's suspected nuclear weapons,
calling it a dispute between Pyongyang and Washington.

In a second day of Cabinet-level talks in Pyongyang, North Korea's
capital, South Korean delegates again demanded that the North abandon
any nuclear weapons development, citing a 1992 inter-Korean agreement
to keep the Korean Peninsula nuclear-free.

Northern negotiators stonewalled the nuclear discussion.

``The Northern side reiterated that the nuclear issue is a matter
between the North and the United States,'' said a statement from the
South Korean government. ``But they said they wanted to resolve the
matter peacefully.''

The talks, which began Sunday, are scheduled to end Tuesday.

Seoul officials said North Korean delegates have not confirmed a U.S.
claim that during talks in Beijing last week they told an American
envoy that they may test, sell or use atomic weapons, depending on
Washington's actions.

Instead, they reiterated that the North made a ``new, bold'' proposal
to the United States during the Beijing talks, but did not elaborate,
South Korean spokesman Shin Eun-sang said.

U.S. officials did not reveal the North's proposal, but South Korea's
JoongAng Ilbo newspaper, quoting unidentified diplomatic sources,
reported Monday that North Korea proposed to give up its nuclear
programs in return for a nonaggression treaty and normalization of
``political and economic relations'' with the United States.

The administration of U.S. President George W. Bush has ruled out
such a treaty, but U.S. officials have said some form of written
security guarantee could be possible. North Korea says it fears being
invaded by the United States following the Iraq war.

During Sunday's talks, North Korea called for ``united efforts of all
the Koreans'' to ``reject the unilateral strong-arm action of foreign
forces ... and prevent the danger of war,'' said the North's official
news agency, KCNA.

Such remarks reflect the North's long-standing policy of driving a
wedge between the South and its main ally, the United States.

The North tried to shift the focus of the talks to linking
cross-border railways and other economic projects with South Korea
that are part of a reconciliation process that grew out of a historic
North-South summit in June 2000.

During a visit Sunday to an unidentified ``front-line unit,'' North
Korean leader Kim Jong Il was satisfied that his soldiers were ready
to repulse ``any surprise attack of the enemy at one stroke,'' and
gave ``guidelines in further increasing the unit's combat
capability,'' KCNA said.

It said North Korean soldiers were determined to ``become human bombs
in safeguarding the headquarters of the revolution and wipe out any
invaders.''

Washington believes North Korea has one or two atomic bombs and may
be trying to make more. North Korea has indicated that it would never
abandon its nuclear programs unless Washington signs a nonaggression
treaty.

During the Beijing talks, U.S. officials said North Korea also
claimed that it had reprocessed 8,000 spent nuclear fuel rods  _  a
key step in producing nuclear weapons that could yield several more
bombs within months. Some speculate that Pyongyang may be bluffing.

The White House has said it will confer with allies about possibly
seeking U.N. sanctions against North Korea. Pyongyang says it would
consider international sanctions a ``declaration of war.''

Washington has said it wants the ``verifiable and irreversible''
elimination of the North's nuclear weapons programs.

Last week's talks in Beijing were the first high-level U.S.-North
Korean contact since nuclear tensions spiked in October, when
Washington accused Pyongyang of having a secret nuclear program in
violation of a 1994 pact.
