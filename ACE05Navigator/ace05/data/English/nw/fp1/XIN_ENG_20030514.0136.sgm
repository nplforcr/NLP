Roundup: Diplomatic moves underway to bring Sri Lankan Tamil Tiger
rebels back to negotiation table

HONG KONG, May 14 (Xinhua)

Norwegian Foreign Minister Jan Petersen is expected to arrive in Sri
Lanka's capital Colombo later Wednesday for a three-day visit to the
country amid hectic diplomatic moves to get peace negotiations with
Tamil Tiger rebels back on track.

Petersen planned to meet Sri Lankan government leaders and is due to
travel to the rebel-held north of for discussions with Tamil Tiger
leader Velupillai Prabhakaran.

Norway, which brokered a ceasefire between the Sri Lankan government
and the Tamil Tigers rebels last February, has sent envoys to draw
the Tigers back to the negotiating table. Last week, Norwegian Deputy
Foreign Minister Vidar Helgesen held talks with government officials
and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam.

Despite last week's efforts, Helgesen and Yasushi Akashi, an envoy
from Japan, the island's biggest aid donor, could not convince the
Tiger rebels to restart talks which they suspended in April over
what, they said, is a lack of progress in rebuilding the war-hit
Tamil areas.

The United States has also backed the peace process in Sri Lanka and
U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for South Asia, Christina Rocca, is
currently in Colombo for talks with government officials and
politicians.

The Sri Lankan government of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe
signed a Norway-brokered ceasefire with the Tamil Tigers in February
last year to end the 19 years of civil war, during which 65,000
people were reported to have been killed and 1. 6 million displaced.

But following six rounds of peace talks, in which the rebels agreed
to settle for regional autonomy rather than total independence, the
rebels decided on April 21 this year to suspend further talks. They
accused the government of not doing enough to resettle thousands of
Tamil civilians displaced by the war.

The rebels also said that they would not participate in an
international donor meeting to be held in June in Japan which is seen
as crucial for garnering funds to rebuild the island nation.

During her three-day stay in Colombo beginning May 11, U.S. Assistant
Secretary of State Christina Rocca held talks with Prime Minister
Ranil Wickremesinghe and President Chandrika Kumaratunga. They
discussed the peace process that has been on hold since the rebels
announced they suspended the talks.

While in Colombo, Rocca "will meet with a variety of government
officials, political leaders, non-government groups and private
individuals to discuss bilateral and regional issues," the U.S.
embassy in Colombo said in an earlier statement.

The U.S. official also planned to travel to the northeastern port
city of Trincomalee, which, with its ethnically divided population
has been a flashpoint in the civil war. But she would not meet the
rebels since the United States has banned them as a " terrorist
organization".

In talks with President Kumaratunga and Prime Minister
Wickremesinghe, Rocca has encouraged the two high-ranking officials
to reconcile, noting that it was critical for the country's leaders
to be united in efforts to end the island's bloody 19-year civil war
and begin rebuilding its shattered economy.

Prime Minister Wickremesinghe and President Kumaratunga are engaged
in a power struggle over who will run the state lottery, an issue
that threatens to disrupt government attempts to restart peace talks
with Tamil Tiger rebels.

Kumaratunga, whose presidential powers give her the authority to fire
the prime minister and dissolve Parliament, has accused
Wickremesinghe of granting too many concessions to the rebels.

Last Friday, Kumaratunga said that she had decided to take over the
Development Lotteries Board, which raises funds for the needy, from a
member of Wickremesinghe's cabinet. The government accused
Kumaratunga of using the move to test her authority and said it could
tempt the president to dismiss key ministers, threatening the
government's peace efforts.

"We are encouraging both sides to pull together because a united
voice in this crucial time of the peace talks is critical to move
forward successfully," Christina  Rocca told reporters in Colombo
Wednesday.
