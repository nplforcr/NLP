`Road map' offers glimmer of hope for Mideast, but obstacles are
enormous With BC-ME-GEN--Mideast Peace Plans

JERUSALEM (AP)

The ``road map'' that the world has unfolded for Israel and the
Palestinians is the latest in a long line of grand designs for the
Middle East. Despite enormous hurdles and a dismal record of past
peace efforts, some see opportunity this time around.

The blueprint comes at a time when U.S. influence in the region is at
its height, backed up by tens of thousands of troops in nearby Iraq.

And for the first time, the United States has enlisted the global
community  _  the United Nations, the European Union and Russia are
cosignatories  _  into a consensus for establishing a Palestinian
state in the West Bank and Gaza, which Israel occupied in the 1967
war.

That makes the administration of U.S. President George W. Bush the
first in nearly 35 years of American peacemaking efforts to formally
and unequivocally accept the idea of a state called Palestine.

Recent months have created a promising ``confluence of circumstances
... the defeat of Saddam Hussein (and) the assertion of American
power in the Middle East,'' and a reevaluation by some Palestinians
of their uprising against Israel, said Tel Aviv University strategic
affairs analyst Bruce Maddy-Weitzman.

But the obstacles are formidable. For starters, the two sides don't
even agree on how to read the map unveiled last week  _ whether it is
Israel or the Palestinians who must make the first concrete move.

Much rests on how forcefully the Bush administration is willing to
apply its new weight.

It has already forced Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to share power
with a newly appointed prime minister, Mahmoud Abbas. But Arabs have
long complained that it refuses to put similar pressure on Israel.
They have to look back to 1956, and the Eisenhower administration's
ultimatum to Israel to return the Sinai Desert to Egypt, for an
example of the kind of muscle they want applied now.

Every American president since the 1960s has been dragged into this
conflict. A couple  _  Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton  _  actually got to
officiate at peace treaty signings  _  Israel and Egypt, Israel and
Jordan. But most others saw their efforts come to nothing.

In an interview with Israel's Yediot Ahronot newspaper published
Friday, U.S. National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice said the Bush
administration was determined to push forward.

``There has been a tremendous change in the Middle East,'' she was
quoted as saying. ``The president expects all the nations of the
region, including Israel, to seize the opportunity ... Our
expectation from the sides have changed in the wake of the Iraq war
and the appointing of a Palestinian prime minister.''

The violence that accompanied this week's diplomatic events
underscored the enormous challenge that lies ahead.

On Tuesday, Israel killed three militants and a bystander in military
operations. Early Wednesday morning, a suicide bomber killed a
waitress and two musicians in a Tel Aviv pub. On Thursday, the
Israeli army raided Gaza in search of militants, killing 12
Palestinians, four of them civilians.

Abbas and his security minister, Mohammed Dahlan, seem ready to
either persuade or force militants who reject the road map to lay
down their arms.

But their bases in the West Bank have been decimated by Israel and
their officers are under severe travel restrictions. And even far
mightier Israel, despite killing scores of militants and arresting
thousands, hasn't managed to stop the suicide bombings.

Phase I of the road map demands an Israeli statement of support for
Palestinian statehood, a freeze on all construction in Jewish
settlements in the West Bank and Gaza, and the dismantling of dozens
of outposts built since 2001. Any of these concessions could bring
down Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's rightist coalition.

The Palestinian leadership is required to reiterate its recognition
of Israel's right to exist in peace, call for an immediate and
unconditional cease-fire, and end all official anti-Israeli
incitement. But the Islamic militants have already rejected a
cease-fire, and the Palestinian Authority has never shown much
appetite for taking them on.

But if these steps are to be simultaneous, Israel is opposed, saying
it doesn't want to take any concrete steps until it is convinced
terrorism has been abandoned.

Phase II, which could come as early as the end of the year, calls for
creating a Palestinian state with ``provisional borders.''

That would require Israel, at the very least, to withdraw troops from
the disconnected Palestinian autonomy zones, and it will also face
pressure to expand the zones into a more contiguous and manageable
territory.

That's a risk, because Palestinian-controlled areas have served as
refuge for militants in the past. It could also mean dismantling
long-established settlements.

Sharon promises that if terrorism stops, he'll make painful
compromises to midwife a Palestinian state. But many doubt it, given
his past support for the Jewish settlers and his opposition to most
previous peace efforts.

Palestinian analyst Khalil Shikaki said the road map was ``likely to
fail'' and he expected the next idea to be international forces
taking over and administering the Palestinian areas  _	which the
United States has so far resisted.

If the sides somehow arrive safely at Phase III, they will hit the
bedrock issues that scuttled the last negotiations.

Here, Abbas' positions differ little from Arafat's.

The Palestinians insist on getting all of the West Bank and Gaza,
noting that Israel would still have four-fifths of historic
Palestine. But Israel would then be a vulnerable 12 miles wide at its
narrowest and most populous point, and even dovish Israelis want balk
at that prospect.

The Palestinians want east Jerusalem for their capital. But it is
ringed by Jewish high-rises, and an explosive deadlock looms over the
hilltop Jews call the Temple Mount and Muslims the Haram-a-Sharif.

Perhaps most difficult, the Palestinians insist on the right of some
4 million Palestinian refugees and their descendants to reclaim homes
and property they lost when Israel became a state in 1948. Israelis
say their country with its 5 million Jewish citizens would cease to
exist as a Jewish state.
