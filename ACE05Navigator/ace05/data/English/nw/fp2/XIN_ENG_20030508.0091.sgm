AMMAN, May 8 (Xinhua)

Amman has welcomed a US decision to lift travel warning against
Jordan, English daily of Jordan Times reported on Thursday.

The American decision, which took effective on Wednesday, was
described by the Jordanian government as new and positive
developments, according to the newspaper.

Officials in Amman told Times that the new decision shows the safety
and security enjoyed by Jordan, a Mideast kingdom neighboring Iraq on
the northeast.

The US State Department had issued a worldwide caution alerting US
citizens to increased potential anti-American violence on March 19,
one day before its military action to disarm Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein started.

As early as on Feb. 7, the US State Department issued a travel
warning of increased security risks in Amman, Beirut, Damascus,
Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, whereas the White House authorized voluntary
departure of dependents and nonessential staff working at US
embassies in those countries.

Late in March, the Jordanian government expelled three Iraqi
diplomats alleged to plan to contaminate a water tank used to supply
US troops deployed in Jordan.

In another security case, several Iraqis were suspiciously involved
in a plot to bomb a luxury hotel in Amman, where hundreds of Western
journalists lived.
