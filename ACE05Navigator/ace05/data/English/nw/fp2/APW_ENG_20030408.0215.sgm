German and Tunisian interior ministers, meeting ahead of the
anniversary of an attack that killed 21 people, mostly German
tourists, have signed an agreement to combat terrorism and other
crimes.

Germany's Otto Schily and his Tunisian counterpart, Hedi Mhenni,
signed the accord Monday in the Tunisian capital, Tunis.

``We must not let ourselves be intimidated by terrorism,'' said
Schily. ``We must pursue our cooperation in economic and other
domains. Because if terrorism intimidates and paralyzes us, it has
already won.''

The agreement specifically targets terrorism, drug trafficking, and
economic and financial crimes. The signing came ahead of the
anniversary of the April 11, 2002, blast on the Tunisian resort
island of Djerba that killed 14 Germans, two French citizens and five
Tunisians. The suspected bomber was among the Tunisians killed.

Schily characterized Tunisian-German relations as ``excellent'' and
said Germany and the north African country must ``concentrate their
efforts for a complete and full elucidation of the Djerba attack.''

The attack damaged Tunisia's tourist trade, with visits down 35
percent in 2002. Schily called for efforts to encourage German
tourism to Tunisia.

German and French authorities suspect that the al-Qaida terror
network was involved in the explosion, which tore apart sections of a
historic synagogue.
