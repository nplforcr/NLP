Governor's reprieve frees Iowa prison inmate

CLARINDA, Iowa (AP)

A man who spent nearly 26 years in prison on a recently overturned
murder conviction walked out of state prison Thursday after Gov. Tom
Vilsack signed a reprieve.

The reprieve, a temporary order sometimes issued to postpone
executions, is especially rare in Iowa, which does not have the death
penalty.

Terry Harrington was a teenager when he was convicted in the 1977
shooting death of John Schweer, a retired police officer working as a
security guard at a local car dealership.

The Iowa Supreme Court overturned Harrington's conviction in
February, based on new evidence that prosecutors withheld police
reports pointing to another suspect and that the state's key witness
had recanted his testimony.

Inmates usually are freed in such cases while prosecutors determine
whether to seek a new trial. Harrington, however, had remained in
prison because the attorney general's office had challenged language
in the ruling that did not directly affect Harrington's case, but
could affect others.

Vilsack, who learned this month that Harrington was still in prison,
asked the Iowa Board of Parole to review the case, writing that the
inmate ``has seemingly been placed in bureaucratic limbo.'' The
governor signed the reprieve after the board recommended it Thursday.

Pottawattamie County Attorney Matthew D. Wilber said prosecutors
intend to retry Harrington.
