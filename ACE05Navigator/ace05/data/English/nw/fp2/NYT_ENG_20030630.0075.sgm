WHITE HOUSE, IN REVERSAL, CONSIDERS AID TO PALESTINIANS
</HEADLINE>

WASHINGTON 

The Bush administration, seeking ways to encourage compromise in the
Middle East, is considering increasing aid to the Palestinians and
providing the first direct assistance to the Palestinian Authority,
administration officials said Monday.

They said the aid would go toward improving the authority's
intelligence and security apparatus and easing living conditions in
the West Bank and Gaza.

An initial expenditure of $300 million is being considered by the
CIA, the offics responsible for attacks on Israelis.

Beyond this help, the administration is said to be mulling the
prospect of changing its policy and aiding the Palestinian Authority
directly. Until now, American aid _ $200 million this year _ has been
transmitted through the United Nations and independent relief
organizations.

``The issue of giving money to the Palestinian Authority arises when
you start to think about rebuilding their security services and
things like that,'' said an administration official. ``We've avoided
the issue in the past because, like others, we distrusted the
Palestinian leadership.''

Now, said this official, the leadership situation was ``vastly
improved'' because of the sidelining of Yasser Arafat and the
ascension _ under American pressure _ of a Palestinian prime
minister, Mahmoud Abbas, and a finance minister, Salam Fayyad.

Administration officials talked about further aid for the
Palestinians in the wake of what many are cautiously calling the
first favorable developments in the region in two and a half years:
the Israeli withdrawal from much of the Gaza Strip and a cease-fire
adopted by at least three Palestinian militant groups.

Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, who appeared on five morning
television shows Monday to talk about the Middle East, took pains to
caution listeners that the situation was fragile. One of the peace
effort's crucial elements _ the cease-fire involving the Palestinian
Authority and militant groups like Hamas _ was not an acceptable
solution, Powell said. Rather, he said, there could not be peace
without the groups being dismantled outright.

``A cease-fire, in and of itself, won't be enough, because if you
leave the capability there, the capability then can be used at some
point in the future,'' Powell said.

The aid packages for the Palestinian Authority were discussed at
interagency meetings last week and then presented to the Palestinian
and Israeli sides over the weekend by a team visiting the Middle
East, led by Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser.

There were reports in Israel that the figure of $1 billion was
discussed within the administration as aid for the Palestinian
Authority. But most knowledgeable officials said this number was so
large it probably could not be absorbed by the authority at present.

The Palestinian Authority already receives a little more than $1
billion a year from outside sources, principally from the European
Union and the Arab League, although this includes the $200 million in
American aid.

The aid is designed to bolster Abbas by proving to the Palestinians
that it is in their interest to pursue a moderate course in making
peace with Israel.

"B}:0264749:90:4777334140699042:40::42United States would also be
pressing Israel to support Abbas with further steps beyond the
withdrawal from Gaza and Bethlehem, which is expected to be completed
in a week or so, an official said. The next milestones expected in
Washington would be further Israeli withdrawals from other
territories in the West Bank, as well as joint, Israeli-Palestinian
security patrols.

There are also supposed to be three-way meetings of Palestinian,
Israeli and American officials to decide the next steps in the
administration's peace plan, known as the road map, which calls for
creation of a Palestinian state within three years.

``Israel will have to carry out wider-scale pullbacks,'' said one
American official. ``But they can't happen until the Palestinians
augment their own security forces, and that will take some time.'' In
addition, Washington is expected to join with Israel in pressing the
Palestinians to take some actions against Hamas.

The pressure point could come when Israel, the United ks, or are
guilty of such attacks in the past.

Israeli officials say that in the 1990s, when such information was
transmitted, the Palestinian Authority actually warned the 3usQects
instead of arresting them. American officials say they will keep a
tighter rein this time.
