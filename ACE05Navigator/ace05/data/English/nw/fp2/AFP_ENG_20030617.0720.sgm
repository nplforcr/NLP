US envoy meets Palestinians in Israel truce bid ahead of Powell visit

GAZA CITY, June 17 (AFP) - Washington's Middle East peace monitor
held his first meeting with Palestinian leaders Tuesday, hoping to
unblock stalled talks on a truce with Israel ahead of a visit this
week by US Secretary of State Colin Powell.

But while Islamic militants still balked at a ceasefire deal, Israeli
and Palestinian officials held a new round of discussions on a
withdrawal of Israeli troops from selected occupied areas,
Palestinian officials said.

Both sides are under heavy US pressure to end one of the worst
periods of violence in the 32-month-old Palestinian uprising and
follow a peace "roadmap" promoted by President George W. Bush at a
June 4 summit in Aqaba, Jordan.

An Israeli foreign ministry spokesman confirmed that Powell was
expected Friday for talks with Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and
Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom.

The website of Israeli public radio said Powell would also meet with
Palestinian prime minister Mahmud Abbas. His information minister,
Nabil Amr, welcomed the visit as "very important."

Powell, who is currently in Cambodia, was flying here before meeting
Sunday in Jordan on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum with
the other members of the diplomatic "quartet" that drafted the
roadmap: Russia, the United Nations and European Union.

His travels come as senior US diplomat John Wolf began the task of
monitoring implementation of the roadmap, which provides for a series
of mutual steps by each side ahead of creation of a Palestinian state
by 2005.

Wolf, who conferred with top Israeli leaders Monday, met for three
hours here Tuesday with Abbas, senior Palestinian security chief
Mohammed Dahlan, and Amin al-Hindi, head of military intelligence.

There was no word on the outcome of the talks, which were held a day
after a senior team of Egyptian mediators left here after failing to
bring Palestinian militants on board a ceasefire deal.

Abbas also held a roundtable with all 13 main Palestinian factions in
Gaza City. The possibility was raised of him also holding separate
sessions afterward with the radical movements Hamas and Islamic
Jihad, Palestinian sources said.

His culture minister, Ziad Abu Amr, said the government was working
for a ceasefire agreement "without putting any pressure on any
party".

Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Maher said talks among the
Palestinian factions were continuing and officials were "very
hopeful" of negotiating an end to the violence that claimed more than
50 lives last week.

Peace prospects had brightened Monday with progress reported on
ceasefire talks and an accord near on a withdrawal of Israeli troops
from parts of the Gaza Strip and perhaps the West Bank town of
Bethlehem.

But a senior Hamas leader said after two days of talks with a senior
Egyptian delegation that "the time is not for a truce" and insisted
on the right to pursue attacks as long as the Israeli occupation
continued.

Sharon also took a hard line later Monday, telling parliament in its
first debate on the roadmap that no settlement to the conflict was
possible "while terrorism runs rampant".

Despite the sharpening rhetoric, Israel and Palestinian officials met
Tuesday on details of an accord for a partial Israeli pullout,
Palestinian officials said.

The officials said Dahlan and General Abdelrazak al-Majaida, head of
public security in the Gaza Strip, took part in the discussions.

Amos Gilad, coordinator of activities in the Palestinian territories,
represented the Israelis at the talks that were held at the Erez
crossing in the northern Gaza Strip, they said, speaking on condition
of anonymity.

A senior Palestinian security source told AFP the meeting was
"positive," but that Israel made no significant concessions.

Israeli defence sources quoted by army radio confirmed the two sides
discussed an Israeli withdrawal from northern Gaza and a takeover of
security responsibility by the Palestinian security forces, and
agreed to meet again within the coming days.

The Palestinians have said they were ready to take charge of security
in any areas evacuated by Israeli forces. Israel has offered to
withdraw in return for a pledge that Palestinian groups would not
launch rocket attacks from Gaza.

Sharon's chief of staff and the head of Israel's internal security
service were both in Washington on Tuesday to explain the
government's stance on Hamas, according to Israeli media.

Israel is against any temporary ceasefire, saying Palestinian groups
would only use it to regroup and rearm. But Washington sees a
ceasefire as an important "step along the way."

The longer-term aim, US State Department spokesman Richard Boucher
said Monday, was to neutralize Hamas and other militant groups that
are "clearly an obstacle to peace.

"Ultimately it has to lead to that kind of dismantlement that the
president talked about, denying of the ability to carry out attacks,"
Boucher said.

Meanwhile, Israel dismissed a Palestinian radio report that top
Palestinian militant Marwan Barghuti, currently on trial for murder,
could be freed within 48 hours.
