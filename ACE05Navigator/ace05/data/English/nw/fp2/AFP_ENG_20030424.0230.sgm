LAGOS, April 24 (AFP)

Forty-six people were killed and dozens injured when two passenger
buses collided on a road outside Nigeria's capital Abuja, national
police spokesman Chris Olakpe told AFP.

Olakpe said the two buses were travelling in opposite directions when
they had a head-on collision late Tuesday at Giri junction, near the
Gwagwalada district of the city.

Earlier police had reported that 39 passengers had died, and 50 were
injured and receiving treatment at the Gwagwalada Specialist
Hospital.

Olakpe said that although no official cause of the accident has been
determined, investigators were examining whether one of the drivers
might have fallen asleep and whether the buses might have been
exceeding the speed limit.

Road accidents occur regularly in Nigeria because of poor roads,
disregard of traffic rules and speeding.

Two weeks ago, some 30 people were killed in an eight-vehicle pile up
in southwest Nigeria on the busy Lagos-Ibadan expressway, near the
economic capital Lagos.

Many of the victims of that accident died when a fireball engulfed
the mass pile-up, because some of the vehicles were carrying jerry
cans of petrol in an effort to beat fuel shortages.
