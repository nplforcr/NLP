Judy Woodruff in Washington with our continuing coverage of the war. The
Pentagon says nearly 100,000 coalition troops now are inside Iraq, more
than one third of the fighting and support force in the Gulf region. On
the home front, some Americans are showing their support for servicemen
and women in the war zone. We're going to go live to a rally in San
Francisco. And we will watch a military wife get a televised glimpse of
her husband overseas.

Thanks very much, Judy. We've been getting reports of new explosions in
and around the northern Iraqi city of Mosul within the past hour as well
as new blasts in Baghdad as well. Reuters reporting now 30 explosions
heard late tonight. It's just after midnight in Baghdad, only within the
past few hours. Meanwhile on the ground, the United States says Saddam
Hussein is facing the world's most awesome military practically on his
doorstep, some 50 miles outside Baghdad. Iraqi television says these are
new pictures of Saddam Hussein meeting with his top officials but we
certainly cannot verify that. U.S. military officials say a suicide car
bombing near Najaf today looks and feels like terrorism. Four American
soldiers were killed in the attack at a military checkpoint. Iraqi's Vice
President, Taha Yaseen Ramadan (ph), says this is only the beginning of
suicide attacks on coalition forces. The Pentagon says more than 50 Iraqi
troops were grabbed at a surprise attack on a commando headquarters in
Iraq. U.S. forces also confiscated weapons, ammunition, gas masks and
communications equipment. The Pentagon says coalition forces are now in
control of the airspace over most of Iraq except for a small section
around Baghdad. For another update on the air war, let's check in with
CNN's Gary Tuchman. He's one of our embedded journalists. He's in an air
base here in the Persian Gulf. Gary ...

<SPEAKER> GARY TUCHMAN, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT </SPEAKER>
Wolf, it's a little loud here, hard to hear you because we have A-10s
taking off over our heads right now. I do want to tell you though the
last time we talked with you about a half an hour ago right in the middle
of our live broadcast an air force plane was coming down the runway and
fire was shooting out of the bottom of the fuse lodge (ph). We have since
talked to a mechanical expert, the production supervisor of the A-10
aircraft behind us. He tells us it was a C-130 transport plane and what
it was were flares; flare weapons that shoot out of the bottom of the
plane as a defensive measure. They use those flares in case a missile's
shot at the plane. They shoot the flares out. The missiles look for heat.
They go to the flare instead of the plane. So while it was very unusual
to see fire shooting out like that, it wasn't inherently dangerous. We
don't know if the plane came back and made a touch and go and landed here
again but this mechanic we talked to, this expert, suggests that it would
have been a good idea for the plane to come back because it reduces its
defensive capability but it was not inherently dangerous, the fire that
we saw on live television shooting out of the bottom of the plane. Now
talking about those C-130s brings us to our next topic, the HC-130, a
cousin of the C-130. That's a refueling plane and last night CNN was
given the opportunity and this is a very different war because we're able
to sleep with the troops, live with the troops, eat with the troops. I
said sleep with them, actually we're in the tents together and we really
are all living together and that's how we get to know so much about them
but we're actually able to fly with them now too and we went last night
on a sortie.
