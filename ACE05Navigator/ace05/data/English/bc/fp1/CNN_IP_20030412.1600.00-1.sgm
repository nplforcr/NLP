Yes, a very breezy Kuwait City this evening. Judy, good to see you once
again. Now that Saddam Hussein's regime has been toppled, coalition
forces are intensifying their search for weapons of mass destruction.
Soldiers found a suspected chemical warhead at an Iraqi air base in
northern Iraq, but they got conflicting test results on whether the
warhead has traces of a nerve agent. Syria today denied that it's helping
hide Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, or sheltering leaders or Iraq's
former regime. Former minister -- Foreign Minister Farouk Al-Shara says
that the allegations come from fanatic circles in the Bush
administration. In Baghdad, Marines ran from tree to tree as a gun battle
erupted near the Palestine Hotel. Looting and general disorder remain the
rule inside the Iraqi capital, where Iraq's top scientist today delivered
himself to U.S. troops. The surrender of Amir Al-Saadi came as mob of
looters continued to roam through parts of Baghdad. Our Rula Amin is
standing by with the latest from the Iraqi capital. Rula, hello.

<SPEAKER> RULA AMIN, CNN CORRESPONDENT </SPEAKER>
Hello, Daryn. Amir Al-Saadi is the first high Iraqi officer that we know
of who has turned himself in so far in Baghdad. He went and spoke to
first, before he went and turned himself in, he spoke to a German
television crew and he told them that even as he is turning himself in,
he's still maintaining Iraq's line that Iraq doesn't have weapons of mass
destruction. Al- Saadi is British-educated, he's very well-spoken. So
many times he headed the Iraqi team that dealt with the U.N. weapons
inspectors, and so many times he defended the regime's line, Iraq doesn't
have weapons of mass destruction and it's not trying to acquire them.
This is significant, the fact that he came ahead on his own, is very
significant, because so far, we haven't seen such moves from any Iraqi
official, even on the level of ministers. Saddam Hussein, his two sons
and most of his aides and his ministers have just disappeared, and we
don't know anything about them. So this move came as a surprise for many
Iraqis, and now they're wondering, are there going to be more officials
turning themselves in? At the same time today, we do know that the
Marines here today had to fight back when two gunmen shot at a U.S.
checkpoint here in Baghdad. They killed one U.S. Marine. The Marines
fired back at the gunmen, killing one of them; the other one fled. This
caused concern among the Marines here, put them on alarm, especially
after the fact that they have found about 40 vests, suicide vests in a
school. These were kind of similar to the photographers' vests. They were
filled with explosives, with a button to detonate the explosives. And
this, of course, was an indication that some people have been trying to
carry out more suicide bombings. These vests were professionally made.
And more alarming was the fact that there were 100 hangers and only about
40 vests were found. That means some people have those vests now. And we
don't know when or where will they use them -- Daryn.

Thanks, Daryn and we will see you later. Marines on patrol inside Baghdad
today found Iraqi weapons in an unusual place, as well as a potential new
source of information about Saddam Hussein. CNN's Martin Savidge has
more.

<SPEAKER> MARTIN SAVIDGE, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera) </SPEAKER>
It's been a busy day for the Marines. Most days are in Baghdad, but today
especially. First of all, the Marines were out this morning, were
investigating a school, and there they say they found what is a suicide
bomb making or vest bomb making facility. What I mean by that is that
suicide bombers traditionally wear these sort of vests, that they would
traditionally pack with high explosives and then carry out their deadly
attacks. At this particular school, they found what they said was a
fabricating plant where they made the vests that would be used for the
attacks; 300 vests were also found inside that facility right here in
Baghdad. And then earlier today, another Marine unit on patrol finds a
man who walks up and says he was Saddam Hussein's plastic surgeon. Well,
of all people, this man may have a wealth of information, not only about
past family members but also about where the regime members that so far
have slipped through the fingers of coalition forces may have gone. Right
now, he's being interviewed intensely by the intelligence officers with
the U.S. Marines to see if he truly knows where those leaders went. And
then, the security situation in Baghdad. Looting still goes on. The
Marines are out there in force. So is the U.S. Army. Trying to quell
things. But they can only do so much. And here is one of the problems
that CNN crews have found going out on the street -- the streets are safe
as long as there is a U.S. military presence on that street. But once the
convoy goes by and the Marines are gone, well, things change
dramatically. One crew went out to an area around the Ministry of
Information. They were told that it was safe, that it was secure. When
they got there, what they found was a melee going on and they were shot
at. So that's the problem with Baghdad these days. You may think it's
safe, it may even sound safe and sound, but it is not, by a long shot.
