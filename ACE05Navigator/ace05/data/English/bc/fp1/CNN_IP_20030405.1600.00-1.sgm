Our Jeff Greenfield will explore a catchphrase in war coverage. How can
the U.S. win the hearts and minds of Iraqis? Let's go now to my colleague
Wolf Blitzer, who is, as he has been for the last few hours, in Kuwait
City -- Wolf.

Thanks very much, Judy. Within the past hour or so, more explosions were
seen and heard in and around Baghdad. You're looking now at some live
nightscope pictures of the city. Coalition forces have opened a new phase
of their assault on Saddam Hussein's regime. Indeed, only within the past
few minutes, Reuters is reporting heavy artillery fire has been heard in
the direction of southwest Baghdad, not far from the international
airport, what used to be called Saddam International Airport, now renamed
Baghdad International Airport. Heavy artillery, according to Reuters,
shaking southwest Baghdad right now in the direction of the international
airport. We're watching to see what's going on. We know that U.S. forces
are in control of that airport right now. We'll get some more details and
get them to our viewers as soon as we can. For the first time, U.S.
troops have moved from the city's outskirts into the heart of the
capital. Commanders say the mission was designed to send a message to the
regime of Saddam Hussein and get information about Iraqi forces. Iraqi
officials insist the tide of the war is actually turning in their favor.
Iraqi TV showed video of people dancing on top of what they said were
U.S. armored vehicles destroyed in battle. In northern Iraq, CNN's Brent
Sadler reported enormous explosions as U.S. forces dropped bombs on Iraqi
fighters. At one site, 28 bombs weighing 7,500 pounds each reportedly
were dropped in a single hour. Faced with U.S. firepower, Iraqi fighters
reportedly have blocked the main roads into Baghdad tonight. And
black-clad members of Saddam Hussein's Fedayeen militia are said to be
prowling the streets. Harry Smith of ITN has more on the battle for
Baghdad.

It's the fight they've been waiting for, the tanks of the American 2nd
Brigade taking the war right to the heart of Saddam's much-vaunted
defenders, to the Republican Guards, holed up in their barracks in the
southwestern suburbs of the Iraqi capital. And on the other side of
Baghdad, in the southeast corner, U.S. Marines close in on another
division of the Republican Guard as the noose around the capital
tightens. Today's assault followed another night of heavy bombardment in
and around Baghdad as shells rained down on units of the Republican Guard
and other military targets. American military planners continue to warn
that there could still be tough fighting ahead, but tonight they're
closer than many believed they would be to the center of Saddam's regime.
