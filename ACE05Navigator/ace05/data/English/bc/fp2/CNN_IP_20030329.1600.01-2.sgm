New Explosions in Mosul, Baghdad

<SPEAKER> WOODRUFF </SPEAKER>
Thanks Heidi. One of the more disturbing developments today was the
suicide bombing in central Iraq near Najaf that resulted in the death of
four U.S. soldiers and for a little bit more better understanding of what
that involves and how U.S. coalition forces can protect themselves, let's
turn to our colleague - my colleague Miles O'Brien in Atlanta. He's there
along with Retired General Wesley Clark. Miles ...
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> MILES O'BRIEN, CNN ANCHOR </SPEAKER>
Thanks very much Judy. Along with Wes Clark, at the Pentagon briefing not
too long ago, General Stanley McChrystal said you know it looks an awful
lot like terrorism. The tactic in response to U.S. military tactics is
perhaps terrorism and is that something that the U.S. military is
properly trained to deal with?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> RETIRED GENERAL WESLEY CLARK, FORMER NATO SUPREME COMMANDER </SPEAKER>
Well, we will know how to deal with this. We'd rather not have to deal
with it because it's going to be devastating to the Iraqi people but the
basic principle here is to protect our troops from getting too close to
the Iraqi people. So we'll have to set up the right kinds of checkpoints
so we've got stand off distance. We'll have to have interpreters there
and we'll have to move them out of a lethal radius as much as possible.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> O'BRIEN </SPEAKER>
Of course what that means is a lot of effort spent on the rear echelon
here perhaps sacrificing forces that could be closer to Baghdad.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> CLARK </SPEAKER>
That's right and somewhere around a third maybe of our infantry strength
and armor strength right now is engaged in Basra and Nasiriya and Najaf
and other places but you know as we saw with the strike on the Baath
party headquarters, we're using our superiority to take the kinds of
actions that will make a difference there I believe.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> O'BRIEN </SPEAKER>
All right. Let's get a few more details on the specific incident. We'll
hear from a Colonel who is on the scene there, I believe a former
colleague of yours, Colonel Grimsley.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> COLONEL WILL GRIMSLEY, U.S. ARMY </SPEAKER>
Earlier this morning, of course it's mid-afternoon here, soldiers in a
routine checkpoint stopped a civilian car as we've been doing working
hard to separate the difference between these (INAUDIBLE) if you will in
civilian clothes and other things who have been using a variety of
vehicles trying to separate them from the local civilian population here.
They stopped the vehicle at the roadblock that has it clearly marked in
Arabic that it's a roadblock. The driver beckoned them a little bit
closer and as the soldiers approached (INAUDIBLE) vehicles, the driver
detonated a bomb killing himself and the four soldiers.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> O'BRIEN </SPEAKER>
To what extent, General Clark, are along these supply lines are the
forces in them, the people driving the trucks, the checkpoints, to what
extent are they sitting ducks?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> CLARK </SPEAKER>
Well, they're moving ducks is the worst case but we do have security
elements in this and we're focused on these areas of resistance around
the built up areas. So generally in the open desert we're flying a convoy
cover with aircraft. We have vehicles that are armed moving in and are
dispersed among the vehicles. Then in the built up areas, we're
controlling the built up areas at least in so far as they can engage the
convoy. That's the intent and then the idea is to work deeper and deeper
and deeper and eventually clear through the built up area.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> O'BRIEN </SPEAKER>
Do you have the sense that the sprint was too fast?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> CLARK </SPEAKER>
No, the sprint was the appropriate tactic because when you can gain
ground like that especially in the case of the 3rd Infantry Division
where the 3rd Infantry Division was able to move through the open desert
and make some 200 miles penetration into Iraq, you should take it. It was
given. It should be taken and then we'll worry about the rear as we have
to.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> O'BRIEN </SPEAKER>
Specifics on the 3rd Infantry right on your screen there, Fort Stewart
and Hunter and a story part of the U.S. Army and obviously very critical
to this particular thrust. One final word, 4th Infantry, we've heard a
lot about it. It's not going to be in place for another couple of weeks.
Do you think they'll - the Pentagon will wait until ...
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> CLARK </SPEAKER>
No, we're not waiting - I shouldn't say we. The Pentagon, the
Administration, is not going to wait. What they're going to do is
maintain continuous pressure against the Iraqis and the idea here is to
use air power, to use the Apache raids like we saw last night from the
101st and to use special operations forces and continue to use
reconnaissance elements and probe and push and continue to grind away at
the defense. At the same time we're working the rear areas and building
up the strength, what we call setting the force with fuel and ammunition
and food and water so we can kick the big offensive off into Baghdad but
there's no pause in the sense of not doing things. It's just a difference
in the nature of the activities.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> O'BRIEN </SPEAKER>
All right. It sounds a bit like the long haul to me. General Wesley
Clark, thank you very much. Judy ...
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> WOODRUFF </SPEAKER>
We always understand more after we hear from the two of you. Thanks very
much, Miles and the General. When we return, their long deployment has
taken them around the world but their work is not over yet. We're going
to visit some U.S. Marines who have just arrived in Kuwait to take part
in the war with Iraq. As we reported, more than a third of coalition
forces in the Gulf region are actually inside Iraq. Others still are in
Kuwait gearing up and when they can, getting a little sleep. CNN's Daryn
Kagan talked with some of the Marines just arrived at Camp Patriot in
Kuwait.
