Checking the headlines in our "Campaign News Daily." Former Senator Gary
Hart is still weighing another run for the White House, and if he joins
the race, he expects a lot of help. Hart told an audience in New Mexico
last night that Republicans should not underestimate him. In his words, I
think if I run, we will have 50,000 volunteers by July. Senator John
Kerry is using this Earth Day to warn against pollution in low-income
urban areas. Kerry proposed the creation of the new environmental justice
position at the EPA, as well as a system to track child asthma and other
diseases with environmental links. Former Democratic Senator Bob
Torricelli recently used cash remaining in his own campaign fund to back
one of the Democratic presidential hopefuls. FEC records show Torricelli
recently gave $2,000 to the White House campaign of Congressman Dick
Gephardt. The records show Torricelli has not donated to any of his
former Democratic Senate colleagues who are now running for president.
Well, getting campaign cash from Bob Torricelli may be helpful. But in
the eyes of many Democrats, getting donations from Hollywood celebrities
is priceless. Our senior political correspondent Candy Crowley has more
on the stars and their feature roles in the money race.

All told, the nine Democratic presidential hopefuls raised almost $24
million in the first quarter of this year. It came in checks of $2,000 or
less from about 22,000 Americans. And, therein, lie the footnotes of
fund-raising. For instance, what do you suppose the real-life dinner
conversations are like at the home of Malcolm's mom, who is really
married to President Bartlet's deputy chief of staff. He gave $2,000 to
real candidate Dick Gephardt. She did the same for also real Howard Dean.
Dean emerges as a Hollywood fave. What meathead you ask would donate to
Dean? This one. No calls, please. Rob Reiner did play a character called
meathead, a liberal in the conservative home of Archie Bunker. He doesn't
really live with Archie, but he really is a liberal. Also on the Dean
bandwagon, Nash and band buddy Crosby. Stills was mum in the first
quarter. But here's a hint. When John Kerry ran unopposed for his Senate
seat last year, Stills was a contributor. Dean also picked up two grand
from Michael Douglas who can afford it now. He has another little tax
deduction. John Edwards who raised more money in the first quarter than
any other candidate got a thousand of it from half of Hollywood's version
of regular people - actress Rita Wilson, who is married to Tom Hanks. And
Joe Lieberman who once told Hollywood to clean up his act, picked up
$2,000 from "Will and Grace" star Debra Messing. And Monty Hall gave
Lieberman $250, but maybe Lieberman will also get whatever is behind
curtain two. A final oddity, of donors who gave over $200 to any
campaign, how many do you suppose were from Iowa, home of the
presidential season's first contest? Of nearly 22,000 people who gave
money, 45 were from Iowa. One hundred and thirty one wrote checks out of
New Hampshire. But candidates don't look for money in Iowa and New
Hampshire. They look for buzz and momentum, which they use to go raise
money where it is, California. Nearly every major candidate had more
donors and raised more money in California than anywhere else. New York
was a close second.

Even more important to campaigns than the people who give $2,000 are the
people who get a lot of other people to give $2,000. The campaign of
Senator John Kerry says it has regular conference calls to keep its key
supporters up to date on campaign plans and developments. There are also
weekly e-mails and face-to- face meetings. The next one for the Kerry
money team is, in fact, next week here in Washington -- Judy.

And we want to have you back to find out if anyone in Hollywood is giving
to the president. Something else for us to work on. Candy Crowley, thanks
very much. Up next, find out who is flying high, courtesy of the company
behind Hooters.
