Dale is a former president speechwriter. OK. Richard Lucia, a junior of
Willingsboro, New Jersey, says, "If somebody doesn't take control of
these outrageous lawsuits, there won't be any good doctors left to
practice medicine." Richard, you've got that right.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> BEGALA </SPEAKER>
No, Richard's got it completely wrong. It's insurance companies who are
ripping off the good doctors because they lost money in the stock market.

<SPEAKER> NOVAK </SPEAKER>
That's the line.

<SPEAKER> BEGALA </SPEAKER>
Let's see. Michael Sheridan of Kalamazoo, Michigan, writes, "If there
isn't a limit to the damage a doctor's mistake can cause, why should
there be a limit on the compensation the patient should receive?" Good
question, Michael.

See, what you don't realize is, for ordinary people, which seems to be a
long time ago, $250,000 is a lot of money.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> BEGALA </SPEAKER>
Not for the kind of pain and suffering that these people go through. And
it's just wrong.

<TURN>
<SPEAKER> NOVAK </SPEAKER>
A question from the lady.

<SPEAKER> KATE COCINEFFER </SPEAKER>
Hi. I'm Kate Cocineffer (ph) from Santa Barbara, California. And I'm
wondering how you propose to contain health care costs if you don't
approve of malpractice caps and HMOs.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> NOVAK </SPEAKER>
That's a good question for Paul.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> BEGALA </SPEAKER>
You have to insure everybody, that's how. That's the best way to control
costs. Because, right now, everybody gets health care, but we get it in
the stupidest way imaginable. People without health insurance go to
emergency rooms, spend $500, when they could have spent $50 at a regular
office visit. That's what's driving it. You want to control costs, insure
everybody. That's what we need.

<SPEAKER> NOVAK </SPEAKER>
That was the Clinton plan. That was the Clinton plan and the people
turned it down.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> BEGALA </SPEAKER>
They did, but they were wrong.
