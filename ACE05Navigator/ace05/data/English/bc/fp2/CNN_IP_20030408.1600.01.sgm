3:58 a.m., explosions reported around the Palestine Hotel where many
international journalists are staying. Central Command later confirms a
U.S. tank shelled the hotel in response to sniper fire. The blast kills
two cameramen, one from Spanish TV another from Reuters. Three Reuters
journalists were injured. 5:33 a.m., CNN's Martin Savidge embedded with
the 1st Battalion 7th Marines says the marines have found chemical
protection suits and antidotes for chemical weapons in a field beside an
industrial complex in southeast Baghdad. Nearby, they found abandoned
weapons and artillery pieces nearby, which they demolished. 7:00 a.m.,
U.S. Central Command says the coalition may never know if Iraqi president
Saddam Hussein survived a U.S. air strike yesterday. A B-1 bomber dropped
four 2,000-pound bombs on a building in a residential area of Baghdad,
after getting intelligence reports senior officials were meeting there,
possibly including Saddam Hussein and his sons. Brigadier General Vince
Brooks also confirmed that a U.S. A-10 Warthog aircraft was shot down by
an Iraqi missile today. The pilot ejected and was rescued. 9:12 a.m.,
CNN's Walter Rodgers traveling with the 3rd Squadron 7th Cavalry says a
senior officer tells him pockets of resistance remain in Baghdad, but
there is, quote, "no longer any organized military resistance in the
city." 12:31 p.m., CNN's Ryan Chilcote reports a firefight near Hillah,
50 miles south of Baghdad. The 101st Airborne's 3rd Brigade battled with
Fedayeen Saddaam fighters. Three U.S. soldiers were injured when an Iraqi
paramilitary threw a grenade at them.

That update on developments today. Well, U.S. Marines today found, we've
learned, what appear to be U.S. military uniforms at a prison outside of
Baghdad. But no sign of American captives. With me now for the latest on
this from the Pentagon is CNN's Barbara Starr. Barbara, my sense was at
the Pentagon briefing they didn't want to say very much about this so now
they are saying more?
</TURN>

<SPEAKER> BARBARA STARR, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT </SPEAKER>
Well, officials are quietly confirming some very disturbing details. They
say U.S. marines who moved through the Rashid military prison in
southeastern Baghdad, did find a pile of what is described as uniforms in
the style of desert camouflage worn by U.S. military personnel. Now some
of these uniforms, we don't know how many, had blood stains on them. And
officials now quietly confirming two of the uniforms had name tags of
Americans currently being held prisoner of war by the Iraqis, according
to these officials. But they are not able to tell us the names of those
people. They are looking at these uniforms very closely. They will try
and conduct DNA analysis on all of them. Now, the Al-Rashid prison was
something of specific interest to the military, because the Iraqis,
apparently, according to these officials, have a long history of holding
military PoWs at that facility. So the U.S. wanted to take a very quick
look at it and see if there was any information that would lead them to
the whereabouts of the PoWs. This is what they found. And you are right,
Judy. At the Pentagon briefing earlier today, we asked about it. We were
not told very much, others than a statement that the U.S. would certainly
engage in intelligence analysis and planning, to see if it could learn
anything about where the PoWs are. And one final detail, a wrap-up from a
POW of 12 years ago, U.S. officials are confirming also to CNN there is
now a team of CIA and defense intelligence agency analysts who are
preparing to go into Iraq to look for information about what might have
happened to Navy Captain Scott Speicher. You will remember, of course,
Captain Speicher was shot down on the first night of Operation Desert
Storm 12 years ago. His fate has never been resolved. There is no reason,
officials say, that they have any information that he may be alive. Of
course, they do believe at this point he is no longer alive. But they
want to get these intelligence officials into Iraq get access, direct
access to Iraqi documents, and intelligence officials inside Iraq, and
see if this will give them the final opportunity to learn what may have
happened to Scott Speicher 12 years ago -- Judy.

<SPEAKER> WOODRUFF </SPEAKER>
All right, Barbara. I want to also ask you about a combination of what's
coming out of the Pentagon and what Nic Robertson is reporting from his
sources in Baghdad. And that is, U.S. military appearing to take up and
holding positions on the main roads, on the highways, but the Iraqi
military or what's left of it, the Fedayeen, the special Republican
Guard, disappearing, so to speak, into the residential areas, the smaller
streets. My question is, at the Pentagon, are they saying that the next
step is to take on what is left of the Iraqi military no matter how deep
into these neighborhoods and -- of Baghdad that they have to go?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> STARR </SPEAKER>
Well, Nic is quite correct. The Pentagon has exactly the same analysis
that Saddam's Fedayeen, the paramilitary fighters, the Republican Guard
the special Republican Guard, all of these people are disbursed
throughout the residential neighborhoods of Baghdad in very small groups.
Let me say, they have one particular concern about a place called Saddam
City on the east side of Baghdad, a Shia enclave. They are very concerned
that eventually the Iraqi regime or what's left of it may coalesce in
that neighborhood and use the Shia, which are very definitely anti-Saddam
Hussein, as a human shield against the U.S. military. The strategy of the
U.S. military at this point is to continue to move through the Baghdad
neighborhoods. Indeed, to keep taking over larger and larger parts of the
city, flush out, as they say, the opposition where they find it. But
there is every indication that, in fact, that's exactly what they plan to
do. Keep taking control of Baghdad, neighborhood by neighborhood, even
though they know these opposition groups are still throughout the city --
Judy.

<SPEAKER> WOODRUFF </SPEAKER>
All right, raising the question, as always, Barbara, of civilian
casualties. Barbara Starr reporting for us from the Pentagon with
information about PoWs. Well, when we come back, an author who left
Baghdad, who left Iraq many years ago and now wants to speak about the
great interest he has and what happens to his country next.
