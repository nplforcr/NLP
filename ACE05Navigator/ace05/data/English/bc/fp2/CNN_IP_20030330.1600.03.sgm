The 7th Marines are on a key mission in central Iraq. They are fanning
out to villages and towns in the region to search for paramilitary groups
that might attack the vital coalition supply lines. And they're also
involved in another key, maybe tougher mission, trying to win over hearts
and minds. CNN's Martin Savidge is embedded with the 7th Marines.

The U.S. Marines here who have been involved for days trying to patrol
and secure the supply lines that reach all the way back to northern
Kuwait have now taken a more proactive stance. Instead of just patrolling
the highways, they are heading into the villages and towns in this
region, trying to find out if there are any hideouts or headquarters for
the paramilitary units that have been striking at supply lines and
striking at U.S. military forces. We rode along with one mission today,
riding in the back of an armored personnel carrier. As these loud
rumbling APCs moved in on one side of the village, before daylight, there
were already Marines on foot in place on the other side, prepared to
catch anybody that might fleeing from the other direction. When the
Marines got into town, though, it wasn't a matter of just kicking down
doors and looking for people. Instead, it took a much more subtle
approach, trying to find the senior elder in the village, or the sheikh,
to talk to him, realizing that he'd be the senior person and probably the
best in the know. They found him and had a long conversation with him. He
put their minds not totally at easy, but did seem to satisfy them that he
said the paramilitary units that had been active in this area had already
left, and had done so days ago. And then what had been search and destroy
became a humanitarian mission because the villagers had their own
problems. It seems Iraqi soldiers, a number of days ago, had shut off the
water supply to their little town. As a result, many of the children were
becoming ill, drinking out of the ditches in culverts for water, the only
place where they could find water. Marine Corps now realized it had a new
mission -- get to the pumping station, get the water back on. And they
know that it will go a long way in helping their effort here in Iraq.
Helping get the hearts and minds of the average Iraqi people on their
side. Martin Savidge, CNN, central Iraq.

Ten million, that's the number of land mines believed hidden in the
dangerous landscape of Iraq. British military engineers are among those
charged with the task of digging them up and clearing the way for
advancing coalition forces. CNN's Richard Blystone says it's a job that
requires skill, patience, and as you may imagine, a very gentle touch.

British Royal Engineers showing us CNN Kuwait how not to fall prey to
warfare's dirtiest trick, mines. The coalition says its forces aren't
using mines now, but the engineers say there may be 10 million Iraqi laid
mines around Iraq. Mines newly planted and others left over from Iraq's
two wars in the last quarter century. British engineers are charged with
clearing living and working space in southern Iraq for troops, aid
workers, and Iraqi civilians, and marking off danger areas with signs
that look uncomfortably like grave markers. Not only mines but unexploded
munitions. They say one in every five bombs, bomblets, and artillery
shells doesn't go off, and lies in wait, sometimes years, for the unwary
or unlucky.

<SPEAKER> BLYSTONE </SPEAKER>
Mines are expensive to clear, but cheap to buy. Humanitarian
organizations say there are 100 million of them planted around the world.
And nine out of 10 of the victims are civilians. This exercise tells you
not only about mines, it tells you what a blessing it is to live in a
place where you don't have to watch every day where you're putting your
feet. Richard Blystone, CNN, Kuwait.
