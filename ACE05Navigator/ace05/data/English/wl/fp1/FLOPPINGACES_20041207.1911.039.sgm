" What kind of a people do they (Japan) think we are? Is it possible
they do not realise that we shall never cease to persevere against them
until they have been taught a lesson which they and the world will never
forget? " -- Winston Churchill

Japanese military leaders recognized American naval strength as the
chief deterrent to war with the United States. Early in 1941, Admiral
Isoroku Yamamoto, Commander of the Japanese Combined Fleet, had
initiated planning for a surprise attack on the United States Pacific
Fleet at the beginning of any hostilities that the Japanese might
undertake. The assumption was that before the United States could
recover from a surprise blow, the Japanese would be able to seize all
their objectives in the Far East, and could then hold out indefinitely.

By September 1941 the Japanese had practically completed secret plans
for a huge assault against Malaya, the Philippines, and the Netherlands
East Indies, to be coordinated with a crushing blow on the Pacific Fleet
at Pearl Harbor in the Hawaiian Island of Oahu. Early in November Vice
Admiral Chuichi Nagumo was named commander of the Pearl Harbor Striking
Force, which rendezvoused secretly in the Kuriles. The force of some 30
ships included six aircraft carriers with about 430 planes, of which
approximately 360 took part in the subsequent attack. At the same time,
a Japanese Advance Expeditionary Force of some 20 submarines was
assembled at Kure naval base on the west coast of Honshu to cooperate in
the attack.

Submarines of the Advance Expeditionary Force began their eastward
movement across the Pacific in mid-November, refueled and resupplied in
the Marshalls, and arrived near Oahu about December 5 (Hawaiian time).
On the night of December 6-7 five midget (two-man) submarines that had
been carried "piggy-back" on large submarines cast off and began
converging on Pearl Harbor.

Nagumo's task force sailed from the Kuriles on 26 November and
arrived, undetected by the Americans, at a point about 200 miles north
of Oahu at 0600 hours (Hawaiian time) on December 7, 1941. Beginning at
0600 and ending at 0715, a total of some 360 planes were launched in
three waves. These planes rendezvoused to the south and then flew toward
Oahu for coordinated attacks.

In Pearl Harbor were 96 vessels, the bulk of the United States
Pacific Fleet. Eight battleships of the Fleet were there, but the
aircraft carriers were all at sea. The Commander in Chief of the Pacific
Fleet (CINCPAC) was Admiral Husband E. Kimmel. Army forces in Hawaii,
including the 24th and 25th Infantry Divisions, were under the command
of Lt. Gen. Walter C. Short, Commanding General of the Hawaiian
Department. On the several airfields were a total of about 390 Navy and
Army planes of all types, of which less than 300 were available for
combat or observation purposes.

The Japanese air attack on Pearl Harbor and on the airfields of Oahu
began at 0755 on December 7, 1941 and ended shortly before 1000. Quickly
recovering from the initial shock of surprise, the Americans fought back
vigorously with antiaircraft fire. Devastation of the airfields was so
quick and thorough that only a few American planes were able to
participate in the counterattack. The Japanese were successful in
accomplishing their principal mission, which was to cripple the Pacific
Fleet. They sunk three battleships, caused another to capsize, and
severely damaged the other four.

All together the Japanese sank or severely damaged 18 ships,
including the 8 battleships, three light cruisers, and three destroyers.
On the airfields the Japanese destroyed 161 American planes (Army 74,
Navy 87) and seriously damaged 102 (Army 71, Navy 31).

The Navy and Marine Corps suffered a total of 2,896 casualties of
which 2,117 were deaths (Navy 2,008, Marines 109) and 779 wounded (Navy
710, Marines 69). The Army (as of midnight, 10 December) lost 228 killed
or died of wounds, 113 seriously wounded and 346 slightly wounded. In
addition, at least 57 civilians were killed and nearly as many seriously
injured.

The Japanese lost 29 planes over Oahu, one large submarine (on 10
December), and all five of the midget submarines. Their personnel losses
(according to Japanese sources) were 55 airmen, nine crewmen on the
midget submarines, and an unknown number on the large submarines. The
Japanese carrier task force sailed away undetected and unscathed.

On December 8, 1941, within less than an hour after a stirring,
six-minute address by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Congress voted,
with only one member dissenting, that a state of war existed between the
United States and Japan, and empowered the President to wage war with
all the resources of the country.

Four days after Pearl Harbor, December 11, 1941, Germany and Italy
declared war on the United States. Congress, this time without a
dissenting vote, immediately recognized the existence of a state of war
with Germany and Italy, and also rescinded an article of the Selective
Service Act prohibiting the use of American armed forces beyond the
Western Hemisphere. And here are a few of the hero's of that day FRANCIS
C. FLAHERTY

Ensign, U.S. Naval Reserve.

Born: 15 March 1919, Charlotte, Michigan.

When it was seen that the U.S.S. Oklahoma was going to capsize and
the order was given to abandon ship, Ens. Flaherty remained in a turret,
holding a flashlight so the remainder of the turret crew could see to
escape, thereby sacrificing his own life.

JACKSON CHARLES PHARRIS

Lieutenant, U.S. Navy, U.S.S. California.

Born: 26 June 1912, Columbus, Georgia.

In charge of the ordnance repair party on the third deck when the
first Japanese torpedo struck almost directly under his station, Lt.
(then Gunner) Pharris was stunned and severely injured by the concussion
which hurled him to the overhead and back to the deck. Quickly
recovering, he acted on his own initiative to set up a hand-supply
ammunition train for the antiaircraft guns. With water and oil rushing
in where the port bulkhead had been torn up from the deck, with many of
the remaining crewmembers overcome by oil fumes, and the ship without
power and listing heavily to port as a result of a second torpedo hit,
Lt. Pharris ordered the shipfitters to counterflood. Twice rendered
unconscious by the nauseous fumes and handicapped by his painful
injuries, he persisted in his desperate efforts to speed up the supply
of ammunition and at the same time repeatedly risked his life to enter
flooding compartments and drag to safety unconscious shipmates who were
gradually being submerged in oil. By his inspiring leadership, his
valiant efforts and his extreme loyalty to his ship and her crew, he
saved many of his shipmates from death and was largely responsible for
keeping the California in action during the attack. His heroic conduct
throughout this first eventful engagement of World War 11 reflects the
highest credit upon Lt. Pharris and enhances the finest traditions of
the U.S. Naval Service.

DONALD KIRBY ROSS

Machinist, U.S. Navy, U.S.S. Nevada.

Born: 8 December 1910, Beverly, Kansas.

When his station in the forward dynamo room of the U.S.S. Nevada
became almost untenable due to smoke, steam, and heat, Machinist Ross
forced his men to leave that station and performed all the duties
himself until blinded and unconscious. Upon being rescued and
resuscitated, he returned and secured the forward dynamo room and
proceeded to the after dynamo room where he was later again rendered
unconscious by exhaustion. Again recovering consciousness he returned to
his station where he remained until directed to abandon it.

ROBERT R. SCOTT

Machinist's Mate First Class, U.S. Navy.

Born: 13 July 1915, Massillon, Ohio.

The air compressor compartment in the U.S.S. California, to which
Scott was assigned as his battle station, was flooded as the result of a
torpedo hit. The remainder of the personnel evacuated that compartment
but Scott refused to leave, saying words to the effect "This is my
station and I will stay and give them air as long as the guns are
going." I read through these citations and get such a feeling of pride
that our country has produced these fine men. Then I read about the
coward running to Canada and cringe, we can produce the best of the
human race and the worst.
