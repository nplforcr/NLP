Florida law allows me to carry my loaded 9mm semi-automatic almost
everywhere, but bars me from carrying onto college campuses. Some states
are currently fighting to allow permit-holders to carry guns onto
campuses, because such populated areas are always considered possible
terrorist targets.

Consider the horrific shooting that took place three years ago at the
Appalachian School of Law in Grundy, Virginia. A 42-year-old student
from Nigeria went on a killing spree with a handgun, taking the lives of
the school's dean, a professor and a fellow student.

The man was finally subdued by other students, but only after they
retrieved their own guns from their cars. Had the students been able to
conceal their weapons at the time of the shooting, lives could have been
saved and the assault could have been prevented.
