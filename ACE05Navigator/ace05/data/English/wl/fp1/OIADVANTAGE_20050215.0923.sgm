Mark at BlogginWallstreet calls attention to an article in last
week's USA Today entitled "Ousting CEOs often boosts stock price ". He
warns that such a strategy is dangerous for individual investors because
it relies on a short term trading strategy and does not consider what
happens to these companies later down the road.

I agree wholeheartedly with this advice. Many researchers have
investigated the performance effects of CEO turnover. One recent study
demonstrates that it is important to pay attention to senior executive
turnover after a CEO change. In their study of CEO succession (2002
Academy of Management Journal, 717-734 ), Wei Shen and Albert Cannella
Jr. found that post-succession senior executive turnover had a
significant negative impact on firm return on assets (ROA) when an
outsider CEO is chosen as a new CEO. So watch the exits at
Hewlett-Packard. An exodus from the executive suite is not a good sign.

In addition, 3-year ROA suffered at companies that selected an
outsider CEO. This refutes the common view that "the worst is over" when
a CEO is fired. A wiser approach may be to wait and see how the firm
responds to the new CEO. Watch for who's jumping ship before jumping in
as an investor.
