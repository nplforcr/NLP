Well, it's official now. George Fitch has officially declared his
candidacy for the Republican nomination for governor. If crime were an
overriding issue, I might give Jerry Kilgore some thought. But, let's
face it, it's not. To my mind, the overriding issues facing Virginia are
figuring out how to provide core services without raising taxes. And
that requires two things: reforming government processes and changing
land use patterns.

I am not privy to George Fitch's thinking in any detail, but my
understanding is that he has done a creditable job with the first
(efficiency in government) as mayor of Warrenton, and has at least a
passing awareness of the issues pertaining to the second. My impression
of Kilgore is that he's a nice enough guy but is utterly conventional in
his thinking.

While Fitch seems a long shot for the nomination, I'm hoping he can
stimulate some fresh ideas in the GOP.... which sorely needs them.

Jerry Kilgore certainly sounds depressingly conventional thus far,
but he hasn't really kicked off his campaign or introduced the issues
and programs he will be running on as yet.

I'd be a lot more interested in George Fitch if he'd taken any kind
of high profile on state issues. I guess he's created the "Warrenton
Miracle," but I'd feel a lot better about him if he'd stood up and
proposed some state efficiency measures before now.

Will: I agree generally with your comments, but the idea that Kilgore
hasn't kicked off his campaign is only technically correct. As you know,
Kilgore has been campaigning for years now. The fact that he hasn't held
his official campaign kickoff, is rather immaterial. He's had ample
opportunity to talk about the issues he'll be running on--and he's been
pretty muted on this front.

I got a 7 page letter from Kilgore the other day. He was asking for
money, of course, but I thought that given the unusual length of the
letter, it might include some pointers about what Kilgore believes in or
what direction he will want to follow if he's elected. Needless to say,
there was no substance to all those pages--it was a money appeal based
on generalities.

Campaigns are won on ideas. Kilgore to date has failed miserably to
express any ideas--come to think about it, I really wonder whether he
has any, other than it is his turn to be our next governor...
