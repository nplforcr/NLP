The Capital Spectator , a good, underrated blog about international
financial events, has a great wrapup of the Yukos mess . The thesis:
We're doomed. Okay, not 'doomed'-doomed, it's just that China is getting
oil from Russia, Russia and China are holding joint military exercises,
Russian government officials are either misinformed or colossal liars,
and just think of where this could send oil prices. If you're ever, for
any reason, feeling a little too optimistic about the International
financial situation, head over to the Spectator for your Fiscal
Armageddon fix.
