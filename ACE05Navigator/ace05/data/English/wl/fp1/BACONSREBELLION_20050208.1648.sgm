Kilgore selling out the down-ticket?

Does Jerry Kilgore, by naming Gilmore--an avowed future candidate--a
co-chairman of his campaign, beholden himself to Gilmore down the road?
How does he not do that? What does that say to his down-ticket friends?
To Bolling? To McDonnell? Did Gilmore condition his support on the
sell-out?

Barnie, you must have paused to read "The Prince" when you were
sorting your books the other day. You have a bad case of Gilmoranoia
....

Sell-out? More like just getting right with the Party and keeping his
options open. Four years is an eternity in politics.

Isn't Gilmore political poison in Virginia?

It's essentially meaningless. Gilmore's support helps JK in some
quarters, hurts in others. Gilmore won't help Kilgore beat Kaine.
Gilmore's support may help Jerry stifle incipient internal primary
challenges. If Kilgore bargained anything over Gilmore's support, he
bargained something he really doesn't possess. Within the GOP, 2009 will
be about the new generation hotshots like Baril, Connaughton and
McDonnell. It will have very little to do with Jim Gilmore. By the time
we get to 2009, it's a whole new ballgame in any event.

Not really, Will. This is just the rock-thrower in me. And this
little menagerie, this love-fest, is such a tempting hornet's nest. I
actually have a high personal regard for Guv-nah Gil-mo'--still keep up
with him some--had a nice chat with him at Hunter Andrew's funeral. He
remains the only living politician in Virginia who did exactly,
precisely what he said he would do. The fact that I think some of that
drifted towards moronic is beside the point.

One compliment I'll give to Gilmore is that he generally appointed
qualified people to head state agencies (Warner has been the best - Whit
Clement has done a great job at VDOT). Allen tended to find his
right-wing friends' housewives and stick them in there.

You're absolutely right, Barnie. Gilmore did what he said he would
do. And if it wasn't for the blockheads in the VA State Senate, e.g.,
Chichester et al, he would have completely eliminated the car tax.

Contrast Gilmore's record with our current governor who unlike George
Washington, he cannot tell a truth:

* He lied to get elected--remember I will not raise your taxes
campaign promise?

* He lied about cutting the budget--remember the $6 billion in
imaginary cuts?

* He lied about the budget shorfall and deficit--remember, if we
don't raise taxes our AAA bond rating is at jeopardy?

I can go on and on. Warner learned well from the Liar-in Chief, Bill
Clinton. What's outrageous is that no one seems upset about all the
falsehoods being propagated by our Governor.

Paul said: "Whit Clement has done a great job at VDOT"

It's all relative, I guess. 216% in average cost overruns doesn't
sound to me like even a modicum of management exists at VDOT.

Ha - no comment by anyone on the "housewives" remark? It's the truth.
No wonder state employees hated Allen.

As for Secretary Clement - here are the stats:

Contracts completed on time:

FY2001: 20%

FY2004: 36%

FY2005: 60%

Contracts completed within budget:

FY2001: 51%

FY2004: 73%

FY2005: 80%

Source: VDOT info service

Both parties admit that VDOT was a mismanaged hell hole before Warner
took over and appointed both Democrats and Republicans to the
transportation board.

The 216% cost overrun figure comes from a JLARC study. Of course, the
VDOT figures will look favorable to them, but that's like relying on
more Warner Administration propaganda and, in all likelihood, lies.
