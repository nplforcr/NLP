The Independent Electoral Commission in Iraq has been far behind in
educating Iraqi voters on the details of the voting system. I fear this
can have catastrophic consequences on the whole process, since voters
would be easily swayed by people with influence to one side or another.

There has already been evidence of manipulation attempts in the
south. Azzaman newspaper reported a few days ago that tribal Sheikhs and
clerics in Nasiriya were trying to obtain a large number of registration
forms in return for money. Another troubling development was SCIRI's
announcement that the Badr brigades would guard voting centers in
Basrah. Any Iraqi with past experience and commonsense would immediately
recognise what this could mean, a very high possibility that armed
militias would influence the choice of gullible voters.

Secular Iraqis have not yet recovered from their shock when a
spokesman for Grand Ayatollah Sistani (the highest religious authority
in the country) stated that the United Iraqi Coalition's list, which is
comprised of major Shi'ite Islamic parties, has the "blessings and the
support of his eminence". This contradicts an earlier statement by
Sistani, a couple of months ago, that he would back an independent
coalition.

However, another spokesman for Sistani, Sayyid Ahmed Al-Safi,
recently denied his endorsement of any particular list, but since there
has been no written statement from Sistani's office backing this, the
Shi'ite Islamic parties continue to claim the support of the Marji'iya ,
and indeed some of their campaign posters already have a large photo of
Sistani with "the choice of the Marji'iya " typed across them.

The United Iraqi Coalition slate includes all the Shi'ite Islamic
parties and movements currently operating in Iraq. With a total of 228
candidates, it consists of: SCIRI (Abdul-Aziz Al-Hakim), Da'wa Islamic
party (Ibrahim Al-Ja'fari), Da'wa Islamic party/Iraq's organisation
(Abdul-Kareem Al-Annizi), Iraqi National Congress (Ahmed Al-Chalabi),
Badr organisation (Hadi Al-Amiri), Hizbollah movement (Hassan Al-Sari),
Hizbollah Al-Iraq (Abdul-Karim Al-Mahud), Al-Fadheela Islamic party
(Nadim Al-Jabiri), Center Assembly party (Mahmud Mohammed Jawad),
Shaheed Al-Mihrab organisation (Ammar Abdul-Aziz Al-Hakeem), Islamic
Work organisation (Ibrahim Al-Mutayri), Sayyid Al-Shuhadaa organisation,
Future Iraq Assembly (Ibrahim Bahr Al-Uloom), Justice and Equality
Assembly (Suhail Al-Jaza'iri), Fayli Kurd Islamic Union (Tha'ir
Al-Fayli), Islamic Fayli Assembly (Muqdad Al-Baghdadi), Turkomen Loyalty
movement (Fariad Omar), and the Islamic Turkomen Union (Abbas
Al-Bayyati).

It also includes Dr. Hussein Al-Shahristani, an Iraqi nuclear
scientist who was nominated as prime minister of the interim government
months ago. It should also be noted that most of the abovementioned
parties also have their own seperate slates.

Personally, I would not like to see these movements gain any leverage
in the forthcoming National Assembly. Some names have dubious ties to
Iran, a large number of them believe in the doctrine of Wilayet Al-Faqih
(rule of the jurisprudent), they utterly reject any attempts of national
reconciliation, and their ambiguity over whether or not they would
prefer Iraq to be an Islamic republic raises legitimate concern among a
wide section of secular Iraqis.

Interim president, Ghazi Ajeel Al-Yawar, has his own list, a
coalition named Iraqiyyun (Iraqis). It includes several figures already
in the government such as the Defence Minister, Hazim Al-Sha'lan, and
the Minister of Industry, Hachim Al-Hassani, who defected from the
Islamic party during the Fallujah offensive.

PM Ayad Allawi heads the Al-Iraqiya coalition of 233 candidates also
containing names in the present government such as Falah Al-Naqib, Qasim
Dawud, Tahir Al-Bakaa', Aqil Al-Saffar, Raja' Al-Khuza'i, and other
figures such as the Sheikh of the Azza tribe, Nazar Habib Al-Khaizaran.
The Iraqi Communist party has an independent party slate of 275
candidates headed by its general secretary, Hamid Majid Musa.

The two major Kurdish factions, the KDP (Barazani) and the PUK
(Talibani), have nominated a joint list of 165 candidates with token
positions given to less known Kurdish parties at the end of the list.
Barazani and Talibani seem to have already reached an agreement on how
they will share future power. Masud Barazani is to take the highest
position in the Kurdish region's government while Jalal Talibani will
take the highest position offered to a Kurd in the future Iraqi
government. They have also divided the seats of the Kurdish parliament
between themselves, 42 seats for each party. I do hope one of the
Kurdish bloggers would elaborate on this, it doesn't sound very right to
me.

The Islamic party, headed by Muhsin Abdul-Hamid, has an independent
slate of 275 candidates. Orginally, their position was to participate in
the elections on the condition that they would be postponed for six
months. They seem to have changed their mind.

Adnan Al-Pachachi heads a slate of about 60 people most of whom are
members of the Independent Democrats Assembly such as interim ministers
Mahdi Al-Hafudh, Ayham Al-Samarra'i, Mishkat Al-Mumin and Layla
Abdul-Latif. Pachachi has reportedly refused to join any coalitions with
other groups and has turned down several figures offering to join his
list.

The National Democratic Coalition slate is headed by Tawfiq
Al-Yassiri, National Council member and the organiser of last December's
anti-terrorism marches, and Justice Minister, Dr. Malik Dohan Al-Hassan.

The Al-Rafidain coalition slate is headed by Yunadim Ganna, former GC
member and National Council member. This is a closed slate of about 30
Iraqis from the Christian Assyrian, Chaldean and Armenian minorities.

The Independent Democratic Trend slate is headed by Aziz Al-Yassiri
and includes a curious mixture of doctors, lawyers, university
professors along with tribal Sheikhs, clerics, former ministers and
governmental officials. Some figures on this list such as former Health
Minister Abdul-Sahib Alwan claim their names were included without their
permission.

The Independent Progressive Front slate is headed by Abdul-Karim
Al-Rubai'i, a tribal Sheikh from Kut, and is similar to the list above.
It also includes former Iraqi football players, Karim Saddam and Laith
Hussein.

The Watani (national) coalition list includes independents and
technocrats headed by Dr. Wathab Dawud Al-Sa'di. It includes names such
as the former judge Dr. Wathiba Al-Sa'di, the writer Jasim Al-Mutayr,
women rights activists Hana Edward and Fawzia Al-Abbasi, and football
player Abd Kadhum.

Dr. Ghassan Al-Attiya, an independent Iraqi politician whom I had the
pleasure to meet in Amman a couple of months ago, heads the Iraqi
Independents Bloc. Al-Attiya strongly advocates national dialogue and
reconciliation. He recently called upon the leaders of the insurgency to
come forth and announce their political programmes (if they have any).

Hameed Al-Kifa'i, Iraqi journalist and former spokesman for the GC,
heads the Democratic Community Movement list. It includes Hashim
Al-Diwan, commentator of the Iraqi Fayhaa channel along with several
others such as Ahmed Al-Barak, former GC member, who abandoned the Iraqi
United Coalition slate because of manipulation in the sequence of
candidates without their knowledge.

The Constitutional Monarchy Movement list headed by Sharif Ali bin
Al-Hussein and includes 275 public Iraqi figures who support a return of
the monarchy.

The Civil Society Organisations Assembly is a coalition comprised of
172 representatives of Iraqi NGO's that were formed after the war.

In addition, a score of tribal Sheikhs from the Juboor, Dulaym,
Rubai'a, Shammar, Ni'aim, Kaab, Maryan, Bazzun, Fatla, Bani Hassan,
Mayyah, Bani Lam, Khaza'il, Ardhiat, Beidhan, Al-Bu Issa, and Al-Bu
Hassaan tribes and clans will be running as independents.

The above are the most prominent coalition lists on the scene. The
IEC had approved a total of 96 lists up until December 15 (3 of which
were later withdrawn so the actual number is 93). The lists include 7200
candidates from over 220 political parties and organisations. A list
should have a minimum of 12 candidates and the maximum numer is 275.

One out of every three candidates in sequence on all lists should be
a woman to ensure a minimum percentage of 30% female members on the
National Assembly. Several political parties had complained earlier that
their slates were limited because of the difficulties in finding female
candidates.

Recent polls by the IEC indicate that some 80% of eligible voters
(all Iraqis over 18 who can prove their Iraqi identity) in the country
have registered. Registration forms for each family were compiled from
their existing ration cards since there was no national census following
the war. The forms were not without errors so the IEC provided details
on the back of the forms on how to fix them, the deadline was December
15.

Iraq is regarded as a single constituency since this is a nationwide
ballot. 7000 voting centers (most of them in schools) across the country
have been prepared to receive voters. Iraqis shall also vote to elect
members of their local Governorate Councils and voters in the north
shall elect members of the Kurdish Parliament

Iraqi exiles abroad (estimated to be about 3 million) with proof of
their Iraqi nationality can vote at Iraqi embassies and consulates.
About ten voting centers will be available worldwide in the UK, Sweden,
USA, Jordan, Iran, Australia, and the UAE. Germany, Syria and Canada,
all of which contain sizeable Iraqi communities, have refused to allow
Iraqis to vote inside their borders.

A registered voter will cast his vote for ONE of the 93 lists. The
National Assembly will consist of 275 members. A candidate would need
(total number of voters/275) votes to get a seat in the assembly. For
example, if 10 million people vote, divide 10,000,000 by 275 and you get
36,363 votes required for a candidate to be on the assembly (actually
it's 36363.6 votes but I'm not quite sure how they are going to deal
with fractional numbers).

So, for a list that gets 11% of the votes (1,100,000 votes), they are
allocated 11% of the 275 seats which is [275/11=]25 members. If that
particular list has 200 candidates, only the top 25 members on the list
get the seats. Therefore it's easy to conclude that the higher a
candidate's name is on the list, the more likely they would get a seat.
I hope I haven't confused anyone!

I should add that the majority of Iraqi voters are in fact confused
and unfamiliar with these details and I have a feeling that the major
players intend to keep it this way. The IEC has promised to distribute
pamphlets and handbills explaining the above process in simple terms to
Iraqi voters.

Voting should commence no later than January 31, 2005.

The elected National Assembly should first elect, from its own
members, a president for the Assembly and two deputies [Article 32(B),
Transitional Adminstrative Law].

The Assembly would then proceed to elect a Presidential Council for
the country (a president and two deputies). The Presidential Council
should be elected from a single list and by a two-thirds majority of
votes [Article 36(A)]. Any member of the National Assembly elected to a
position in the Presidential Council or the Council of Ministers should
resign his membership in the National Assembly [Article 28(A)]. The
Assembly has the power to remove a member of the Presidential Council by
a three-fourths majority of votes.

The Presidential Council should unanimously choose a Prime Minister
and a Council of Ministers within two weeks. If it fails to do so, the
National Assembly would handle the task of choosing a PM by a two-thirds
majority of votes. If the PM fails to nominate a Council of Ministers
within one month, the Presidency Council should name another PM. The PM
and the Council of Ministers should obtain a vote of confidence from the
National Assembly by a majority vote in order to be approved [Article
38(A)]

However, the primary task of the National Assembly is to draft a
permanent constitution for the country by no later than August 15, 2005
[Article 61(A)]. The draft should be approved by Iraqis in a general
referendum no later than October 15, 2005 [Article 61(B)]. Following the
approval of the constitution, elections for a permanent government
should be held no later than December 15, 2005 [Article 61(D)].

Note that if the National Assembly fails to draft a permanent
constitution by August 15, 2005 or if the draft is rejected in the
referendum, the National Assembly should be dissolved and elections for
a new National Assembly held no later than December 15, 2005 [Article
61(E)]

I will try to post more on the elections in the next few days.
