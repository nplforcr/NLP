I's posting something today that I take a great interest in.

Los Angeles County Deputy Sheriff David March was killed on Apr 29th,
2002 by this man

Here is his story. Deputy March was shot and killed after stopping a
vehicle in Irwindale, California at approximately 1040 hours. The
suspect had stated to friends that he wanted to kill a police officer
during a traffic stop. The suspect intentionally got stopped and waited
for Deputy March to get in front of his patrol car so he could open
fire, as Deputy March would have no place to take cover. Deputy March
was shot several times in the head and chest.

The suspect, who was identified shortly after the shooting, fled to
Mexico where he remains at large. The Mexican government refuses to
extradite the murderer back to the United States.

Deputy March had been with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's
Department for seven years and is survived by his wife and
step-daughter. His wife wrote a letter recently April 29th, 2002, was
the worst day of my life. I found out that my soul-mate, David March,
was shot and killed on duty while doing a routine traffic stop at 10:30
in the morning. He was shot in the side of his chest, where the vest did
not cover, then executed in the head. I also learned that his killer
fled the scene.

Instantly the news media was at the hospital, and at my home to catch
the drama as it unfolded. I didn't want to be on camera, but needed the
worlds help finding the person(s), that fled from the scene in a black
Maxima. Within two days, the face of the expected killer was all over
the news. I wanted to see the eyes of a killer who took my dreams away.

As I sat there, ill in despair, two Hispanic men told the media, they
had told Armando Garcia, "Chato" to flee to the border (Mexico). I
thought this was a place to run and hide. Not a place to seek a safe
haven. I was soon to find out how broken our justice system really was.

I began to learn new terminology such as; extradition, deportation,
bounty hunters, treaty, corruption within Mexico, and worst of all our
own governments lack of involvement. This was very overwhelming
considering my future, as I saw it, was never going to be the same.

As I approach the one year mark, I cannot believe that this is a
battle I need to fight. My husband protected the citizens and loved this
career. This was his lifelong dream to make this world a better place. I
want to believe that his death brings attention to the very real problem
that if people kill and flee to the border, they are getting away with
murder.

This isn't a new problem. How could this not be a huge concern? After
September 11th, this nation was attacked by terrorists. We learned that
we are not safe, and our homeland needs a better protection system.

Mexico is harboring Mr. Garcia. A cop killer is still living a free
life in Mexico. This is a continuous nightmare. Mexico will not
extradite a violent criminal wanted for murder, because they don't agree
with the death penalty, or life in prison. This monster moved from
Mexico and illegally came to the United States, and resided here in
California. He plagued our streets with drugs, and criminal activities.
Why isn't he accountable to our laws, if he lived here and committed
murder here? Why is Mexico forcing their laws on our country? Where is
the mutual respect? Why would Mexico protect a criminal, who had been
deported three times, and had two previous attempted murders, prior to
Dave's death? I want the assurances he is paying for the crime here in
the United States. Our family will not settle for a lesser crime such as
manslaughter. He took a life, and should be willing to give up his own.
That is why the law is in place.

I'm so grateful to our law enforcement, our Sheriff, Lee Baca, and
our District Attorney, Steve Cooley, for being a voice, and supporting
our family during this most difficult time. This is in the hands of our
federal Government, and our President. We appreciate the prayers and
want this tragedy to shed light on our broken system. We cannot let the
bad guys win. Our citizens and our police officers are not safe. Please
write to your local Congressman and our leaders in Washington D.C. More
voices and letters will increase our chances in making our government
accountable. To this day even though the Mexican Government knows where
he is staying in Mexico that government refuses to hand him over. Just
yesterday one of our elected leaders asked the Mexican Government to
hand this scumbag over County Supervisor Mike Antonovich is again urging
the president of Mexico to extradite a Mexican national wanted for the
murder of a Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy.

During a traffic stop on April 29, 2002, in Irwindale, Deputy David
March of the Santa Clarita Valley was allegedly shot to death by Armando
Garcia, who fled to Mexico.

March stopped a black Nissan Maxima and entered the car's license
plate into his Mobil Data Terminal. Shortly after, he was shot several
times at close range.

In a letter to Mexican President Vicente Fox, Antonovich referred to
the recent extradition of Victor Garcia, a suspect in the 2001 murder of
a Costa Mesa teenager, and asked that Armando Garcia be extradited as
well.

The Mexican government has refused repeated requests for Armando
Garcia's extradition. As a policy, Mexico doesn't extradite suspects
facing either the death penalty or life in prison.

According to a Supreme Court of Mexico ruling in 2001, no extradition
can be granted until the requesting state gives assurances the suspect
will be eligible for parole.

The purpose of punishment is rehabilitation, the Mexican court held,
which makes life in prison cruel and unusual punishment. The court
reaffirmed the ruling in April. Also, Mexico generally does not
extradite nationals like Garcia.

A new California law, which takes effect Saturday, amends the penal
code, allowing anyone prosecuted in a foreign jurisdiction for crimes
committed in the United States, to be retried if they re-enter the
country. And a request to boycott Mexico is gaining steam among us cops
which I hope will catch on with other's A boycott of Mexican products,
services and vacations to pressure that government to extradite
fugitives wanted for murder and other crimes in the United States is
gaining momentum among law enforcement agencies, including the Riverside
Sheriffs' Association. "These guys are murderers and heinous killers.
I'm sure citizens of Mexico don't want them hanging around in their
neighborhoods either," said Pat McNamara, president of the Riverside
Sheriffs' Association. "Extraditing these people is purely the right
thing to do."

The movement began after the April 2002 killing of Los Angeles County
sheriff's Deputy David March. While on patrol in Irwindale, March was
allegedly shot to death by Armando Garcia, who fled to Mexico.

Garcia remains untouchable to American authorities because Mexico
doesn't extradite suspects facing either the death penalty or life in
prison without parole...

Organizations adopted the boycott after taking their cause from
Sacramento to Washington, D.C., only to be shunned later by federal
authorities who've offered little recognition of the problem, said Roy
Burns, president of the Association for Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs.

"We've talked to levels as high as (Atorney General) John Ashcroft
and are unable to achieve our goals through political and legal means,"
Burns said. "This is our last stab at justice." Is David's murder the
only one of it's kind? No way. On April 9, 1999, Anabella Vara was
kidnapped and held at gunpoint by her estranged husband, Daniel Perez,
for four hours. Her life was repeatedly threatened. Anabella was able to
temporarily reach a place of safety and call 911 on her cell phone. This
enraged defendant Perez who pursued her fleeing vehicle with his vehicle
and ran her off the road causing her to run for her life. Perez caught
up to Anabella and shot her in the back of the head, leaving her for
dead.

Perez was quickly apprehended and charged with attempted murder. He
bailed out on $1,000,000, probably illegally posted. Two days before the
trial ended, on the day that Anabella, her sister and her father
testified, August 27, 1999, Perez broke into the family home at 3:00
a.m. and opened fire hitting her father, Carlos Vara, seven times,
killing him instantly. Anabella had been relocated to a "safe house"
that evening. Perez has threatened to come back and finish the job on
Anabella. She lives in constant fear of his return.

Daniel Perez was convicted of all counts and sentenced in absentia to
33 years, 8 months to life, plus life on Anabella's case. Carlos Vara's
murder took place in Fontana, California and San Bernardino County
District Attorney has filed one count of murder with a P.C. 12022.5(a)
and 12022.53(d) allegations. Although no special circumstance has been
filed to date, it is clear that P.C. 190.2(a)(10) applies. There are
many many cases such as these, against civilians, against cops . On May
13, 1979, Deputy Willmon approached Alvaro Rodarte and began questioning
him about a burglary that had taken place in the area. During the
encounter, a struggle ensued and Rodarte stabbed Deputy Willmon numerous
times. Rodarte then fled to Mexico where he remained a fugitive for 24
years.

On August 29, 2003, Rodarte was arrested in Zacatecas. He will be
prosecuted for the murder of Deputy Willmon in Mexico under Article IV
of the Mexican Federal Penal Code. If convicted, he could have been
sentenced to prison for 2-60 years; however on September 4, 2003 a
Mexican court ruled that the statute of limitations had run and Rodarte
was acquitted and released.

[Note: If this were a California case, the acquittal would forever
bar prosecution and Rodarte would be free to live in either country
without fear of arrest or prosecution.]

Agent Richard Fass, 37, United States Drug Enforcement Agency

Murdered June 30, 1994

On his last day as an undercover officer, after attending a transfer
party in his honor, Agent Fass went to a strip mall in Glendale, Arizona
to complete a narcotics transaction. The drug dealers had planned a
robbery and execution and immediately engaged Fass in a gun battle. Fass
fired back, wounding one man, but was then hit by a fusillade of
bullets. He was shot six times in the head at point blank range with a
.45 caliber handgun. The two shooters were quickly arrested, prosecuted,
convicted and sentenced to life without the possibility of parole plus
55 years. The mastermind of the plot to kill Agent Fass, Augustin
Vasquez Mendoza, fled to Mexico.

An intense manhunt was begun. Police began interrogating members of
Vasquez' family and death threats began flowing. Nine Mexican police
officers throughout the area were assassinated, including five who had
worked directly on this investigation. During the course of the
investigation, DEA agents and local police uncovered the lucrative drug
trade of the Sinaloan Cowboys from Michoacan. Drug runners throughout
the United States were apprehended.

After more than six years of searching and rewards totaling $2.2
million dollars, Vasquez was arrested in Puebla on July 10, 2000.

In January, 2002, after a year and a half of negotiating, a judge
ruled that the recent Mexican Supreme Court decision barred his
extradition. The US argued that under the law as it existed in 1994, a
life sentence meant 25 years in prison. With all charges stacked, the
maximum sentence would be 53 years. In October, 2002, the PGR approved
extradition and DEA agents went to the prison where Vasquez-Mendoza was
being housed only to be turned away at the jail door. Vazquez-Mendoza
had filed an Amparo related to a pending drug charge arguing that he
couldn't have been the subject wanted in the drug case because at that
time he was on the run for the murder of Agent Fass. Prison authorities
refused to honor the extradition order and release Vazquez-Mendoza to
U.S. authorities until the Mexican drug charges were resolved. As of the
date of this report, more than nine years after the murder of Agent
Fass, Mexico continues to refuse to release Vazquez-Mendoza to the
United States. There is some question as to whether or not the
extradition process will have to begin anew. I would urge anyone reading
this blog to please send email to your representative urging them to
pass legislation to force the Mexican Government into action. You can
