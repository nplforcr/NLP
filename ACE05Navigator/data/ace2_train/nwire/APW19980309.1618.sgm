RAINY PASS, Alaska (AP) _ Five-time champion Rick Swenson wasted
no time moving to the front of the pack in the Iditarod Trail Sled
Dog Race.
Swenson on Monday was the first musher to reach the Rainy Pass
checkpoint, which is tucked deep in the Alaska Range. He arrived 90
minutes ahead of his nearest competitor, Charlie Boulding of
Manley, Alaska. Vern Halter of Willow arrived just four minutes
after Boulding.
With clear skies, the dog teams rested on beds of straw on
frozen Puntilla Lake, surrounded by spectacular views of craggy,
snow-covered peaks.
Mitch Seavey of Sterling arrived in fourth place, two-time
champion Jeff King reached the checkpoint in fifth place. Mike
Nosko of Wasilla arrived at in sixth place and rookie Shawn
Sidelinger of Wasilla was in seventh.
Mushers were pleased with snow conditions on the trail.
``I can't imagine anyone complaining about the trail,'' said
musher Linwood Fiedler of Willow, who was first to leave the Finger
Lake checkpoint for the to Rainy Pass. ``It was a sprint trail as
far as I was concerned.''
Sixty-three teams _ including four past champions _ are entered
in this year's race, as well as 19 rookies and mushers from five
foreign countries.
Swenson added interest to the 26th Iditarod by reentering after
being withdrawn in 1996 when a dog in his team died along the
trail.
Swenson, who has never finished lower than 10th in 20 Iditarods,
bitterly protested, and the decision was overturned last year. But
he sat out 1997 anyway.
Swenson has said he's running in part to honor his dog Ariel,
who died of apparent strangulation in 1996.
``I'm as confident as anyone,'' Swenson said.
