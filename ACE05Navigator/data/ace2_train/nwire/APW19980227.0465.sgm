SRINAGAR, India (AP) _ Police fired tear gas to disperse
stone-throwing protesters during an anti-election strike in the
capital of volatile Kashmir state Friday, a day ahead of
parliamentary elections.
Local news agencies reported no injuries in the clashes.
Muslim groups who want Kashmir to be independent of India have
called another strike in Srinagar on Saturday, as well as an
election boycott. Their opposition and cold weather in the
Himalayan state are likely to keep turnout low.
Shops were closed and government offices deserted Friday. Small
groups of protesters gathered at several spots in Srinagar.
Eight leaders of the separatist All Party Hurriyat Conference
have been arrested since Wednesday for asking people to boycott the
voting, said state Chief Secretary Ashok Jaitly.
On Friday, angry Hurriyat activists hurled stones at
paramilitary forces protesting the arrest of their leaders. Police
fired 150 tear gas shells to disperse the protesters who fought
hit-and-run battles throughout Friday.
Temperatures were just above freezing in Srinagar, with a foot
(30 centimeters) of snow on the ground following storms that shut
down air and road traffic earlier in the week.
Voting scheduled in Srinagar and elsewhere in India on Saturday,
the fourth of six days of balloting, will wrap up all but a few
parliamentary races. Counting begins the following Monday, and a
new parliament and prime minister are expected to be seated by
mid-March.
Paramilitary troops took up positions Thursday at schools and
government offices, where the voting will be held in Srinagar, 600
kilometers (375 miles) north of New Delhi. Suspected militants
lobbed a grenade into a school as troops took up position, but no
one was injured.
Paramilitary forces guarded 1,000 polling stations set up in
Srinagar district, where 850,000 voters are registered. The state
capital has been the center of a nine-year insurgency by Muslims
militants fighting for independence from India or for merger with
neighboring Pakistan, which is officially Islamic. Kashmir is the
only Muslim majority state in overwhelmingly Hindu India.
The main parliamentary contenders _ the centrist Congress party
and the Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party _ have made
stability a central issue in the campaign.
More than 70 people died in election-related violence during the
first three voting days and during campaigning, mostly in the
eastern state of Bihar, where unrest is blamed on caste tensions
and criminals. Another 58 people died in a series of bombings in
southern India linked to Hindu-Muslim tensions exacerbated by
campaign rhetoric.
