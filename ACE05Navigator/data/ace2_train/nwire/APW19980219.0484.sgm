Death toll rises from Cameroon tanker blast

	   YAOUNDE, Cameroon (AP) _ The death toll in a massive rail tanker
car explosion has climbed to 221 with authorities on Wednesday
reporting an additional 84 fatalities.
	   Authorities said the new casualties included wounded people who
later died in hospital and bodies of victims taken from the scene
before being accounted for.
	   Foreign aid workers said they were working around the clock to
save the lives of the remaining wounded _ many with severe burns to
most of their bodies.
	   ``We shall do the impossible to make sure the rest survive,''
said Bernard Viala, the head of a French emergency medical team in
Yaounde.
	   Investigators were still probing the site where two tanker cars
rolled loose on the train tracks, derailed and then ruptured on
Saturday. The gushing petroleum ignited and set off a powerful
explosion, instantly killing dozens of bystanders.
	   The investigation results are not expected to be released until
the end of March or early April.
	   While the cause of the explosion has not been determined, police
said it may have been purposefully triggered. Several bystanders
had threatened to start a fire when police forced them away from
the crash site.
	   Several Cameroon government ministers blamed the great loss of
life on some of the victims themselves _ bystanders and motorists
who had rushed to the scene to scoop up the spilling fuel to use in
their automobiles.
	   Army volunteers continued burying many victims who were burned
beyond recognition in mass graves. Other corpses have been returned
to their families for private burial.
