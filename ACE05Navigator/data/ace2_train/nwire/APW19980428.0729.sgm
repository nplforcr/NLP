Credit Lyonnais workers protest against EU demands

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - Some 2,500 Credit Lyonnais employees
demonstrated Tuesday outside European Union headquarters to protest
against conditions the EU wants to impose on French government
subsidies to the troubled state bank.
Union representatives met with officials of the EU Commission.
After several hours, they walked out saying talks had been
completely unproductive.
``The Commission won't budge,'' said Georges Begot of the CFDT
union. ``There is still some room for negotiation but it seems very
limited.''
The Commission has powers to veto or impose conditions on
government subsidies if it judges they distort fair competition
within the 15-nation bloc.
The EU executive wants Credit Lyonnais to sell off all European
assets outside France and reduce its French network. The Commission
says the French government should sell the bank to the best bidder
by the end of 1999.
The French government and the EU have been battling for years
over billions of francs (dollars) aid given to Credit Lyonnais
since the bank incurred heavy losses in the 1980s.
Last month, the bank reported net profits of 1.1 billion French
francs (dlrs 180 million) in 1997. But the EU's top competition
watchdog, Karel Van Miert, said the results contained an illegal
government subsidy of more than 3 billion francs (dlrs 490
million.)
French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn said last week
France will sell Credit Lyonnais by the end of next year.
Credit Lyonnais has shed several thousand jobs over the past 10
years, but still employs 32,000 people. The protesters blamed job
losses on EU interference.
``France is paying (for the bank). Why does the EU have to
interfere?'' said Marie-Claude Latte, who has worked at Credit
Lyonnais for 28 years.
``We've made sacrifices: we've had to accept longer working
hours and less money,'' she added, waving one of her paychecks.
