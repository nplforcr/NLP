NEW YORK _ Leather skirts, fishnet stockings and a pink feather
boa were deployed on behalf of the First Amendment Tuesday as about
30 strippers and lap dancers rallied in City Hall Park to protest Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's crackdown on sex shops and clubs.
The dancers were joined by about 70 supporters as they marched
around a fountain not far from the mayor's office, chanting:
``Giuliani _ scared of sex! Who's he going to censor next?''
Giuliani's hulking white GMC Suburban 2500 was parked in the
driveway, a signal that he was in. But he was among the few workers
in the area who resisted gawking at the lunchtime spectacle. ``This
is my first time,'' said Matthew Huang, 32, a paralegal who works
nearby. ``How often are they here?''
Depending on a court's action, the Giuliani administration could
begin as soon as Monday its enforcement of a new zoning law
prohibiting X-rated businesses within 500 feet of homes, schools,
churches or one another _ a provision intended to make it harder
for the businesses to operate and to keep them in the less savory
neighborhoods.
Elissa Wald, a 28-year-old dancer who said she worked at several
clubs including ``Dangerous Curves, in midtown Manhattan,'' carried
a double-sided sign that read ``I Strip and I Vote'' on the front
and ``Will Strip for Liberty'' on the back.
``This law would put thousands of women out of work,'' she said.
``Everyone's sex lives are at stake.''
The law would require all but about 20 of the city's 150 sex
businesses to move or close, city officials have said. Enforcement
of the law has been postponed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Second Circuit until Monday, when a three-judge panel in the court
is to hear arguments about whether the law violates the First
Amendment guarantee of free speech.
Randy M. Mastro, the deputy mayor for operations, said Tuesday
that he expected the panel to rule for the city. ``This is their
last dance,'' he said, shortly after the strippers ended their
protest.
Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil
Liberties Union, which represents several customers who are
challenging the sex-shop ban, said the rally was intended to warn
voters that their city was becoming ``increasingly authoritarian
and repressive.''
The demonstrators did not seek a permit until less than two
hours before the protest was scheduled to begin, said Edward
Skyler, a spokesman for the city's Parks and Recreation Department.
But police officers, who had set up barricades to prevent the
demonstrators from getting too near City Hall, said they allowed
the protest to proceed as long as it was orderly.
Viva Knievel, 26, posed for photographs of the word ``Go-Go''
spelled in sequins across her sweater. And Lola Urena, 26, a
burlesque stripper, described herself as ``just a normal person
trying to make a living .''
Among the patrons who came out in support of the strip clubs was
William MacLeod, a 32-year-old real estate broker who said most
people did not realize that many of the clubs have a largely
mainstream clientele.
``Dirty old men only account for maybe 5 percent,'' he said.
``This law isn't going to stop any topless clubs or fully nude
clubs. They just won't have a neon sign out in front.''
Alyssa Simon, 28, a dancer for the last seven years, did not
seem so sure. ``The powers that be,'' she said, ``are not going to
listen to a bunch of strippers and bouncers walking around in a
circle.''
