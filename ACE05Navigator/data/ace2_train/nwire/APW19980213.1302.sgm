UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Alarmed over new violence in Sierra Leone,
the Security Council appealed Friday to the Nigerian-led African
intervention force to allow speedy delivery of humanitarian aid now
that that its troops have captured the West African nation's
capital.
The Nigerian-led force launched an attack last week to unseat
the military junta and restore the country's elected president,
Ahmed Tejan Kabbah, who was ousted last May in a bloody coup.
Nigerian-led troops captured large parts of the center of the
capital, Freetown, on Thursday. Civilians reportedly celebrated in
the streets.
The events in Sierra Leone were deeply embarrassing to the
council, however. Although the 15 members had called for Kabbah's
restoration, they had never authorized the use of force.
Instead, the council had endorsed an agreement reached last year
for a peaceful restoration of the elected government by April 22.
Foreign ministers of the West African countries involved in the
peacekeeping force had visited U.N. headquarters last week but gave
no indication they were about to launch a bid to overthrow the
junta.
``The Security Council expressed its concern over the very
unstable situation in parts of the country and over the heavy
civilian losses which have been reported,'' council President Denis
Dangue Rewaka of Gabon told reporters after a meeting.
``The Security Council has emphasized that international
humanitarian law must be upheld,'' he added. ``The Security Council
called for the humanitarian assistance to be activated immediately,
including cross-border operations, and for full, unrestricted
access to the people in need.''
Dangue Rewaka also said the council urged protection of
international aid workers and steps to return the country to
stability. It urged the Nigerian-led force ``to cooperate fully''
with the United Nations ``with the view of rapid evaluation of the
situation on the ground.''
Dangue Rewaka refused to say whether the council felt
embarrassed by the failure of West African foreign ministers to
notify them in advance of the campaign.
But he noted that the council had never authorized the West
Africans to use force to oust the junta. He acknowledged that the
council was ``concerned by the use of force.''
During the meeting, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator, Sergio de
Mello, said about 250,000 people had been displaced by the
fighting. De Mello said the situation was ``dramatic, not only in
the area of Freetown'' but elsewhere in the country.
The West African force intervened in Sierra Leone soon after the
junta led by Maj. Johnny Koroma toppled Kabbah. After bombarding
Freetown in a failed attempt to drive the junta from power, the
force blockaded Freetown's port to prevent food, fuel and other
necessities from reaching the city.
Despite international criticism of its human-rights record,
Nigeria _ apparently trying to improve its image and its clout in
the region _ has become a self-appointed protector of democracy in
parts of Africa.
