LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) _ Maqsood Kalia, whose murder convictions
were questioned by Lahore's police chief, was hanged Wednesday in
the Punjab capital of Lahore.
The Lahore High Court sentenced Kalia to death last year for the
shooting deaths of two people in 1996.
Kalia appealed the verdict, and during the second trial Lahore
Police Chief Mubasher Ahmed testified that he believed Kalia was
innocent. The court rejected Ahmed's testimony, saying the police
chief had no evidence to back his claim.
President Rafiq Tarar on Tuesday rejected an appeal for clemency
filed by Kalia's mother, authorities said.
Kalia was hanged inside Lahore's Kot Lakbhat Jail, prison
officials said. His body was later given to his family, who waited
outside the prison compound.
