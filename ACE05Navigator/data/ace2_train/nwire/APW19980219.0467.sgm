	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Outraged at the spectacle of young
people kissing in a streetcar named for a 13th century crusader
against pagan sleaze, the Greek Catholic Church asked the
government Thursday to quash Valentine's Day celebrations.
	   ``From a Christian point of view, this is a profanation of a
martyr of virtue and chastity,'' Tertulian Langa, a Greek Catholic
priest, told the AP by telephone. ``His name has been turned into a
public orgy.''
	   Langa was referring to a Feb. 14 stunt in a streetcar dubbed
Valentine, in which a justice of the peace married 20 young couples
for the day. The event attracted a lot of media attention and
helped popularize the holiday, recently introduced to formerly
communist Romania.
	   ``This streetcar has no sacred character and has nothing to do
with his Holiness. We are insulted,'' said Langa from the Greek
Catholic headquarters, some 325 kilometers (203 miles) northwest of
Bucharest.
	   Langan said he had sent letters to five government ministries,
requesting they ``undertake the necessary action to combat this
degradation of public life.''
	   In a different protest of the holiday, the mayor of Cluj,
Gheorghe Funar, refused a Valentine's Day gift of flowers, claiming
such an act symbolized ``false capitalist values.''
	   St. Valentine was a Roman priest and martyr who fought against
pagan love fests. He was killed in Rome in 270.
	   In the past couple of years, Romanians have begun exchanging
bunches of flowers and small gifts on Feb. 14, calling it ``Lovers'
Day.''
