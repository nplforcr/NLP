Turkey asks EU to keep out of dispute over Aegean islets
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey asked the European Union on Monday
to refrain from approving the inclusion of disputed Aegean islets
into the union's environmental programs by Greece.
Turkey and Greece, have long running disputes over air, sea and
seabed mineral rights in the Aegean and both lay claims to several
uninhabited rocky islets.
``This is a very delicate matter and our call on the EU is to
use its common sense and not allow itself to be used by Greece,''
Sermet Atacanli, Foreign Ministry spokesman, told a news
conference.
The Foreign Ministry said Greece has been including the disputed
Aegean islands in EU environmental programs on waste, waste water,
natural habitats and wild birds.
Atacanli did not name any specific island.
He said there were several islets, rocks in the Aegean Sea whose
sovereignty had not been transferred to Greece by international
treaties.
The two countries came close to war in February 1996 over claims
to rocky islets, called Kardak (or Imia in Greek). Last-minute
mediation by the international community deterred armed conflict.
``This issue must be resolved by talks together,'' Atacanli
said. ``Turkey will not accept any unilateral actions that Greece
would take on these geographical formations.''
Atacanli said Turkey has relayed its opposition over the issue
to the European Union.
