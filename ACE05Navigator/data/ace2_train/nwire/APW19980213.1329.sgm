Reports: Ajax planning stock exchange listing

AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Storied Dutch soccer club Ajax
Amsterdam is planning to seek a listing on the Amsterdam stock
exchange, Dutch media reported Friday, citing ``reliable sources.''
Ajax declined comment, but a meeting has been called Monday for
club members to discuss the future, club sources told the Dutch NOS
and RTL news programs.
Ajax, currently leading the Dutch league and a quarter finalist
in the UEFA Cup, would become the first Dutch soccer club to float
itself on the stock exchange in a move that would likely generate
millions of guilders (dlrs) in extra revenue.
Although Ajax has long been one of Europe's most successful
clubs, it has never spent heavily on the transfer market, instead
relying on its world famous youth development program to turn out
home-grown stars.
In the past the scheme has produced players including Johan
Cruyff, Arsenal's Dennis Bergkamp and AC Milan striker Patrick
Kluivert.
Ajax has won the Dutch league a record 26 times and European
soccer's greatest prize, the European Cup, four times.
Any move to the stock exchange is expected to be led by Ajax's
main sponsor, the Dutch bank ABN Amro. Sources at the bank also
declined to comment on a planned listing.
