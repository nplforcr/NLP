European police officials plot anti-hooligan strategy

BLACKBURN, England (AP) _ European police and security officials
devised a common strategy Friday to prevent the World Cup from
being turned into a battleground for soccer hooligans.
More than 100 delegates from 26 countries attended a seminar at
Ewood Park, home of Blackburn Rovers Football Club, to discuss ways
of combatting violent troublemakers during this summer's month-long
tournament in France.
With a record 32 nations taking part, teams criss-crossing the
country for each game and demand for tickets far outstripping the
supply, hooliganism shapes up as the World Cup's biggest nightmare.
``The football hooligan is a violent criminal,'' said British
Home Secretary Jack Straw. ``He is a coward who hides behind the
good name of the decent supporter. My message to the hooligan is
simple: We know who you are, we know what your plans are and we
will do everything we can to stop you bringing disgrace and shame
to this country.''
While hooliganism has been largely brought under control in
England, traveling English fans continue to pose a huge security
threat abroad.
``We have to deal with the tiny minority who want to use
football matches as an opportunity for violence,'' Straw said.
``Modern professional football originated in England. I am proud
that we exported the game to all parts of the world.
``But I am ashamed that we also exported football hooliganism,
and that we have such experience of dealing with hooliganism in
England.''
Straw announced that Britain was re-launching its ``Hooligan
Hotline,'' giving fans a chance to call a toll-free number to tip
off police about planned activities by soccer thugs.
He said the British government was negotiating with the French
to help prevent hooligans convicted in France from then travelling
back to cause further trouble during the tournament.
In addition, courts in Britain have the authority to impose
``restriction orders'' on convicted hooligans, preventing them from
traveling to France.
Straw said British intelligence officers and ``police spotters''
would track known troublemakers and report their movement to French
officials.
``The French will welcome with open arms the law-abiding fan,''
he said. ``However, they will bring the full force of the law down
on those who cause trouble and there will be 24 hour judges near
the stadia to mete out swift justice to the hooligan.''
With England allocated only 9,128 tickets for its first three
games, there are fears that large number of fans will travel to
France to purchase tickets on the blackmarket.
``The sale of tickets to rival fans in the same part of the
ground is just a simple recipe for disaster,'' Straw said.
