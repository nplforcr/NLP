Some Reshuffling In Sports Marketing
There were two developments Wednesday involving sports
marketing.
The Octagon sports marketing unit of the Interpublic Group of
Cos. named Frank Craighill to the new position of president.
Craighill, 58, who has been co-chairman of the Advantage
International division of Octagon in Washington, will remain based
there and also divide his time between Octagon's London and New
York offices. Craighill will report to Frank Lowe, chairman and
chief executive of Octagon and chairman and chief executive of
another Interpublic unit, Lowe Group. At Advantage, the other
co-chairman, Lee Fentress, 56, will become the sole chairman.
The appointment of Craighill came days after Octagon acquired
CSI, a London company that specializes in selling and distributing
sports TV rights. Terms were not disclosed. CSI has 90 employees in
London, Amsterdam, Hong Kong, New York and Sydney. Michael Watt,
57, chairman of CSI, continues in that role.
And the Starcom Media Services division of the Leo Burnett Co.
in Chicago formed a unit named Starcom Sports Marketing. Wally
Hayward, 29, and Bruce Blair, 47, were named to head the unit as
sports marketing director and sports media director, respectively.
Hayward had been a supervisor for sports and event marketing at
Burnett. Blair had held a similar position at Starcom Media.
