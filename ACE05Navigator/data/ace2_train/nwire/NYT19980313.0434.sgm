WASHINGTON _ Following are excerpts of a deposition of former
White House volunteer Kathleen Willey given Jan. 11 in the sexual
harassment case of Paula Jones. Ms. Willey was questioned by Robert
Bennett, the president's lawyer, and Daniel Gecker, her lawyer. The
deposition was made public Friday by lawyers for Mrs. Jones.
Q. Can you tell us how the meeting in the private office
concluded?
A. I think I said, ``I've taken enough of your time and thank
you for listening.''
Q. And did he say anything back to you?
A. I think he said he was sorry that I was having the problems _
that we were having the problems we were having.
Q. Is that all that you recall that he said?
A. Yes.
Q. And then what did you do?
A. Then I turned to leave.
Q. And after you turned to leave, what happened?
A. Well, we got to the door back into the Oval Office. We got to
that door.
Q. By walking back down the same hall?
A. Uh-huh.
Q. And then what happened?
A. Then he hugged me again and said that they would try to help
me.
Q. And was that at the door in the private hallway leading back
into the Oval Office?
A. Yes.
Q. And please describe the exact physical nature of that hug.
A. It was a hug.
Q. Is that all; just an embrace?
A. It was a hug.
Q. Can you describe it any more fully that that?
A. Just a big hug.
Q. Did you hug him back?
A. I think so. I mean, I think so. I mean, I don't really recall
if I did or not.. ...
Q. After that hug, what happened after that?
A. Well, it continued.
Q. OK. Please describe exactly how it continued.
A. The hug just continued longer than I expected.
Q. Can you give us an estimation as to how long the hug
continued?
A. No.
Q. It wasn't all afternoon; is that correct?
A. All afternoon?
Q. It was not?
A. No.
Q. OK. Was it as long as a minute?
A. I really don't know.
Q. Was there any kissing involved in that hug?
A. There was an attempt.
Q. Please describe that as fully as you can.
A. He attempted to kiss me.
Q. Mr. Clinton did?
A. Yes.
Q. On the lips?
A. Yes.
Q. Anyplace else? On the neck?
A. No.
Q. And what was your response to that attempt?
A. Surprise.
Q. Did you allow him to kiss you?
A. I don't think so.
Q. Was he successful in kissing you?
A. I can't remember.
Q. It could be that he was successful?
A. It could be that he wasn't. I don't remember.
Q. Was that the only _ was there only one instance of an attempt
on Mr. Clinton's part to kiss you?
A. Yes.
Q. Did you ever attempt to kiss him back?
A. No.
Q. During the time period that this hug went on longer than you
expected, as you said, was there any other attempt physically on
his part to touch you?
A. Well, he had his arms around me.
Q. Other than having his arms around your back _ is that right?
A. Right.
Q. Did he ever move his arms to any other portion on your body?
A. I don't recall.
Q. Is it possible he did?
A. I don't recall.
Q. Is it possible that he did?
A. I don't recall.
Mr. Campbell: Judge, I'm going to have to object as
nonresponsive.
The Court: Well, I suppose anything is possible, but do you have
any recollection of him touching you other than the hug regardless
of whether it was two seconds or 10 seconds? That's what Mr.
Campbell wants to know.
The Deponent: Restate the question, please.
Mr. Campbell: Would you read it back, please?
(The court reporter read back the following: ``Question: Did he
ever move his arms to any other portion on your body? Answer: I
don't recall. Question: Is it possible that he did? Answer: I don't
recall.'')
By Mr. Campbell:
Q. So the question is, Ma'am, is it possible that Mr. Clinton
ever moved his hands to any portion of your body other than your
back?
Mr. Bennett: I object to the form of the question. I mean, I
don't know _
The Court: ... Ms. Willey, you're hesitating and I can
understand that. I suspect you're trying to think about it so that
you are perfectly honest in your responses. I think what Mr.
Campbell wants to know is if there was any physical contact between
you and the president which had a sexual connotation, and I think
you can answer that. Is that _
Mr. Campbell: I'll accept that question, Your Honor.
The Court: And if there wasn't, say so. If there was, say yes
and describe it.
Ms. Willey: I think that's where he was going.
The Court: What's that, Ma'am?
Ms. Willey: I think that's where he was going.
The Court: No, I think what Mr. Campbell is interested in is
where did he go?
By Mr. Campbell:
Q. Yes. What's the basis for you saying, ``I think that's where
he was going''?
A. It's just a feeling I had.
Q. Can you tell me how you got that feeling?
A. I felt like it was more than just a platonic hug.
Q. Can you give us any more specifics as to why you felt that
way?
A. No.
Q. What were you wearing on that occasion?
A. I don't have the faintest idea.
Q. Can you tell us whether it was a dress or pants?
A. I don't remember.
Q. Did Mr. Clinton ever place his hands on any part of your
legs?
A. No.
Q. Did Mr. Clinton ever place his hands on any part of your
buttocks?
A. I don't remember.
Q. You don't remember?
A. (Deponent shaking head).
Q. So you cannot say _
A. I cannot recall.
Q. You can't categorically say he did not; is that correct?
A. Correct.
Q. Did Mr. Clinton ever seek to take either of your hands and
place it on his body anyplace?
A. Yes.
Q. Please describe that.
Mr. Gecker: Judge, I hate to be the one to do this, but is it
possible that we could excuse those folks who aren't necessary for
this part of the deposition?
The Court: Oh, sure. You can take a five-minute recess if you'd
like and you can talk. I'm not necessary.
Mr. Gecker: I don't need a recess, Judge, but I'm trying to be
as polite as I can.
The Court: There's no need for me to be in here.
Mr. Gecker: As much as I like your law clerks _
The Court: There's no need for me to be in here.
Mr. Bennett: I think Your Honor should be here.
The Court: Then I'll ask the ladies to leave.
Mr. Gecker: With all due respect to them, I apologize.
The Court: That's no problem. We just want her to be
comfortable.
Mr. Campbell: That's fine.
Mr. Gecker: Do you want to take a break?
The Court: Do you want a break, Ms. Willey?
Ms. Willey: Yes.
The Court: Then we'll take a break.
(A break was taken.)
Mr. Campbell: Would you read my last question back, please?
(The court reporter read back the following: ``Question: Did Mr.
Clinton ever seek to take either of your hands and place it on his
body anyplace? Answer: Yes. Question: Please describe that.'')
The Court: Ms. Willey, would it be easier for you if I stepped
out for this portion?
Ms. Willey: (Shaking head.)
The Court: All right.
A. He put his hands _ he put my hands on his genitals.
Q. Which hand?
A. I don't recall.
Q. And approximately how long did it last?
A. I don't recall.
Q. What was your reaction?
A. It was very unexpected.
Q. Were you surprised?
A. Yes.
Q. Did you resist?
A. Yes.
Q. How?
A. I just resisted.
Q. Did you try to push him away?
A. Yes.
Q. Were you successful?
A. Yes.

A. I don't recall the time frame.
Q. Did you attempt to withdraw your hand from his genital area?
A. Yes.
Q. Promptly?

Q. Were you successful?
A. As best I recall.
Q. Immediately successful?

within a second or two?
A. Probably.
Q. Could you tell whether he was aroused?
A. Yes.
Q. And was he?

leave the room?

Q. Did you ever have to physically push him away?
A. I don't recall.
Q. Do you recall whether you had to struggle at all?
A. No.
Mr. Bennett: Well, I'm sorry _ no, you don't recall or, no, you
didn't have to struggle?
The Deponent: No, there was not a struggle. I don't think there
was a struggle.
By Mr. Campbell:
Q. Was there any type of resistance on his part to letting you
go? Any type?
A. I can't judge that. ...
Q. Did Mr. Clinton attempt to touch your breasts?
A. I think so.
Q. And what's the basis for your thinking so?
A. I have a recollection of that.
Q. Was he successful?
A. Yes.
Q. With one hand or both hands?
A. I don't recall.

contact took place?

right now?

Office proper, went behind his desk and sat down behind his desk?

thanking him in some way. I mean, he didn't just sit there.

A. No. I mean, I just _ it was ``goodbye'' probably. ...
Q. Pardon me, Ma'am. Let me finish the question. Did you say
anything to him in reference to the physical contact that had just
occurred?
