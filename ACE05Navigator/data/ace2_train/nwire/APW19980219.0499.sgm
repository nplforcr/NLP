Prime minister calls March 11 general elections

	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen
on Thursday made a suprise announcement of national elections to be
held March 11.
	   Although elections were required to be held by September, most
had expected they would be delayed until after the May 28
plebiscite on the European Union's latest treaty.
	   Nyrup Rasmussen interrupted an ordinary parliament session to
announce the elections, saying ``big and important decisions lie
ahead,'' a clear reference to the plebiscite.
	   Danes are known for their lukewarm attitude about EU membership
and many are concerned that accepting the latest EU treaty would
require Denmark to give up too much sovereignty.
	   Nyrup Rasmussen said another major topic was to lower the total
government debt of 711.6 billion kroner (dlrs 104.6 4 billion).
	   The government coalition including Nyrup Rasmussen's Social
Democratic Party and the small center Radical Party did not resign.
The two groups hold 70 of parliament's 179 seats _ 20 short of the
90 required for majority.
	   Radical Party leader Marianne Jelved told reporters the purpose
of the elections was to ask for voters' support to continue the
government's policy to ``enable us to continue into the next
century.''
	   ``Denmark today has a stronger economy, a better employment
policy and a more equitable distribution of the benefits than most
other countries in Europe,'' Nyrup Rasmussen said.
	   Unemployment is at 7.4 percent of the labor force _ one of the
lowest in Europe _ and the 1997 growth was of 2.2 percent.
	   Nyrup Rasmussen became prime minister in 1993, after a decade
with Conservative-Liberal governments. His first four-party Cabinet
controlled 90 parliamentary seats and became the first majority
government in more than 20 years.
	   Since then, two parties dropped out, making it a minority
government whose parliamentary survival was assured by a small
center party and two left-wing groups.
	   The prime minister said he would ``be a beast if I didn't say
'yes of course''' about calling the elections now that the
Liberal-Conservative opposition is weak.
	   The Conservatives have been divided by internal fights in almost
a year, while their Liberal ally has dived slightly in recent
polls.
	   A recent opinion poll indicated the Social Democrats would win
only 56 parliamentary seats _ six less than they currently holds
