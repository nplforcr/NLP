TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran has declined an invitation from the
U.S. Soccer Federation to play a friendly match in the United
States, an Iranian soccer official said Thursday.
Mohsen Safai Farahani, the president of Iran's football
federation, said the USSF sent a fax about two weeks ago, inviting
Iran to come to the United States ``in an all-expenses paid trip to
meet the U.S. team in a friendly match.''
``Unfortunately, and because our program is fully booked and
because of the long distance, we thanked them and turned the
invitation down,'' Farahani told reporters.
However, USSF vice president and deputy commissioner of U.S.
Major League Soccer Sunil Gulati said Thursday that the invitation
was for Iran to play Mexico, not the United States.
``Mexico wants to play some Asian teams because they have South
Korea in their group,'' Gulati said.
Since Mexico on occasion plays in the United States, often to
reach their heavy support in Southern California, the USSF acted on
behalf of the Mexican federation in sending out invitation letters
to South Korea, Iran and China.
Gulati also approached Japan verbally, he said.
Also attending the press conference was Croatian coach Tomislav
Ivic, who took over the Iranian team from Brazilian Valdir Vierra
after Iran claimed the last spot in the 32-team World Cup field in
France in June.
``It would have been a fantastic opportunity and we would've
liked to go there but our schedule was complete and we couldn't
change it,'' Ivic said.
The United States and Iran are grouped together along with
Germany and Yugoslavia for the first round of the World Cup.
Ivic said the Iranian team will travel to France next week to
play against first division teams Montpellier and Nantes before
returning to Tehran for friendly matches against Hungary, Ghana and
Jamaica.
Ivic downplayed the importance of Iran's World Cup match with
the United States.
``We want to qualify to the second round. This is our first
wish. All three games are different and we need to prepare special
tactics for each one. Each game is important,'' Ivic said.
He said the roster for the finals was not complete and he was
awaiting a number of players to join the camp after finishing their
club duty.
Some 15 players, who form the backbone of the national team, are
from Iran's two major clubs, Esteqlal and Piroozi. Both teams are
currently engaged in Asian championships.
Despite the risk of losing one or more of the players to injury,
Farahani said he was happy that the Esteqlal and Piroozi players
were competing in regional competitions.
``We believe that playing in the league and Asian tournaments
will create the best situation for the national team,'' he said.
