Study reveals growing Dutch support for death penalty

AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Dutch support for the death
penalty is growing with a majority in favor of imposing it for
serious crimes, including incest and child abuse, a new study
shows.
According to the latest survey of 3,000 people, one in two
participants, or 52 percent, supports the death penalty, which was
abolished in the Netherlands in 1870.
In previous surveys, support ranged between 40 and 45 percent.
Survey investigator Dr. Karin Wittebrood said Thursday it is
difficult to establish what had triggered the increase, but timing
may have been a factor.
The study was conducted during the latter part of 1996 when
publicity over the Marc Dutroux child-murder case in neighboring
Belgium reached its height and public concerns spilled over the
border.
Wittebrood said many of those who support the death penalty said
it should be imposed for murder, incest and child abuse.
Although the rise reflects a significant change in public
opinion, Wittebrood believes the change is only temporary in this
tolerant country.
The survey also showed that supporters of the death penalty are
mostly young people or those with a low level of education.
The survey, carried out by the Netherlands Institute for the
Study of Crime and Law Enforcement, was conducted via face-to-face
interviews. Its margin of error was not disclosed.
