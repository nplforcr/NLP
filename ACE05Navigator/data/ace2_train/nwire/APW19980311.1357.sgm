SORRENTO, Italy (AP) _ The season debut of Tour of France winner
Jan Ullrich was short-lived Wednesday as the flu-weakened German
withdrew during the opening stage of the Tirreno-Adriatico race.
Ullrich, who stopped pedaling one hour into the race, said he
was confident he would recover his health and form by the start of
the Milan-to-San Remo classic _ the first race of the 1998 World
Cup scheduled along the Italian Riviera on March 21.
Young Italian Gabriele Balducci took the first of eight stages
of the Tirreno-Adriatico _ a 133-kilometer (83-mile) circuit around
Sorrento _ outsprinting the pack at the finish line.
A five-second bonus from the stage victory also gave Balducci
the overall leadership. Despite the double victory, the Italian was
unhappy with narrow roads and slippery asphalt, and had a public
argument with the race organizers.
The stage was marred by several spills. The most serious, in the
final kilometers, sent Italian cyclist Paolo Bettini to the
hospital with several bruises and a cut lip.
``The course was dangerous and risky. Let's hope the next stages
are scheduled on safer roads,'' Balducci said.
Balducci, who completed the stage in three hours, 27.55 minutes,
edged Denmark's Lars Michaelsen at the finish line. Another Dane,
veteran Rolf Sorensen, placed fourth, behind Italy's Roberto
Petito.
Thursday's second stage of 164 kilometers (103 miles) will take
cyclists from Sorrento to Baia Domizia.
The Tirreno-Adriatico, the opening event of the Italian cycling
season which is considered a warmup for the Milan-to-San Remo,
crosses central Italy from the Tyrrhenian to the Adriatic sea.
