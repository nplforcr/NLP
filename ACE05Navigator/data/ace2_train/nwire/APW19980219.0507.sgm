Swiss government rejects Jewish refugee's compensation claim
</HEADLINE>

	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ The Swiss government has rejected the
compensation claim of a World War II Jewish refugee who claimed the
country was responsible for his parents' deaths, it was announced
Thursday.
	   The Federal Department of Finance said in a statement that the
claim filed last year by Charles Sonabend had no legal ground. The
demand related to events too far in the past, it said.
	   Sonabend, 66, who now lives in London, sought 100,000 Swiss
francs (dlrs 69,000), saying the Swiss authorities' asylum policy
led to his parents' deaths.
	   In 1942, the Sonabend family fled to neutral Switzerland from
Nazi-occupied Belgium. According to a Swiss television report in
October, the family was arrested and deported to France two days
later. Sonabend's parents later died at the Auschwitz concentration
camp.
	   The department said Sonabend can appeal to Switzerland's supreme
court.
	   ``The federal authorities, unlike the Nazi regime, didn't commit
war crimes,'' the department said. ``The government expresses its
deeply felt sympathy and regret, independently of the judicial
assessment of the request and of the historical evaluation of the
circumstances.''
	   Sonabend's attorney, Marc Richter, said in a statement that he
will appeal. He described as ``cheap'' the government's
justification for turning down the claim.
	   Surrounded by Germany, Nazi-occupied France and Nazi-allied
Italy, wartime Switzerland took in nearly 30,000 Jews. But it
turned away an equal number, many of them to a certain death.
	   Switzerland has been accused of acting as Hitler's banker, and
its banks has been criticized for dragging their feet over allowing
Holocaust victims' heirs access to dormant accounts. But it has
also been praised for its efforts to investigate fully what
happened and make amends for any wrongdoing.
	   The committee of independent historians set up to investigate
Switzerland's wartime past said Thursday that its full report on
the country's gold transactions with the Nazi regime will be
released April 7.
	   The panel's preliminary report in December said Switzerland was
involved in 76 percent of Nazi Germany's gold transactions during
World War II. It added that Swiss banks handled dlrs 450 million in
Nazi gold _ a portion of which had been looted.
	   Switzerland's major banks have set up a fund to help needy
survivors of the Holocaust, especially those still living in
Eastern Europe.
