NEW YORK _ A city police officer has been dismissed for ordering
child pornography through the mail, police department officials
said Friday.
Police Commissioner Howard Safir this week ordered the dismissal
of the officer, Brian Matthews, 35, who has been on modified
assignment since August 1995, after he was linked to a child
pornography ring.
According to testimony during a police department administrative
trial last fall, Canadian investigators were conducting a sting
operation using the mailing list of a child pornographer when they
received an order from Matthews' address in New Hyde Park, N.Y.
Postal inspectors said the order contained $48 in cash and a form
requesting three videotapes depicting sexual acts involving boys as
young as 7.
The name on the order form was that of a former resident at
Matthews' home, but a handwriting analyst testified at the
departmental trial that Matthews had written the request. A
fingerprint expert testified that two prints on the order form
appeared to match Matthews' index finger and thumb.
Although police investigators had previously stated that
Matthews was arrested after signing for the tapes under the bogus
name, postal inspectors said that he was never arrested and that
the tapes were never delivered.
Matthews was a 15-year police veteran. His lawyer, Marvyn
Kornberg, said Matthews denied any involvement with the order, and
he pointed out that federal authorities had declined to prosecute.
