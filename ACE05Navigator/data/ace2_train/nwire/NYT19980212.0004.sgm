NAGANO, Japan _ Paul Kariya, the superstar left wing of the
Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, will not play for Canada because of a
concussion he sustained Feb. 1. Kariya will be replaced by
Montreal's Mark Recchi. The next round of the tournament begins
Friday.
``Paul said it was the worst day of his life,'' said Bob Clarke,
general manager for Team Canada. ``He apologized to his teammates
for being unable to compete.''
Kariya was expected to be a sensation in Japan because of his
speed on the wider international surface and because he is of
Japanese descent.
