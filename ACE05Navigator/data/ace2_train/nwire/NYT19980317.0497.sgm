STANFORD, Calif. _ It was fun while it lasted for the Harvard
women's basketball team.
The Crimson's run in the NCAA tournament ended on Monday night
with an 82-64 loss to Arkansas (20-10) in a second-round matchup at
Maples Pavilion at Stanford University.
Wendy Willits, Arkansas' freshman guard, nailed six 3-pointers
(including five in the first nine minutes of the game), one short
of the NCAA tournament record. Meanwhile, the senior point guard
Christy Smith led Arkansas with 19 points while also recording 11
assists.
So Harvard (23-5) is left to ponder the significance of its run
and the possible long-term impact on both the Crimson and the Ivy
League.
Defeating top-seeded Stanford in the first round was a truly
remarkable feat by Harvard. Not only had no 16th-seeded team ever
defeated a No. 1-seeded team, but none had come closer than 32
points.
Maybe it was only a matter of time before an Ivy League team
broke through. After all, Dartmouth lost by only three points to
Virginia in 1995, when the Cavaliers were seeded third in the East
Regional. A year later, Harvard was within five points late in the
second half against Vanderbilt, also seeded third and playing at
home.
Arkansas coach Gary Blair, who was not short on hyperbole during
the postgame news conference, was clearly impressed by Harvard.
``Harvard is the American dream,'' he said. ``It's an indication
to the rest of America to realize, 'We can.' I'm just as excited
for Harvard as I was for my basketball team.''
But Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith was a bit more restrained
in her assessment.
``Yes, it will certainly have an impact,'' Delaney-Smith said.
`It will impact in that Allison Feaster and her senior classmates
have left a legacy for the younger players to believe that anything
can happen.
``In the sense of changing the program _ attracting a higher
level of players _ I doubt that because we are already competing
with some of the top 10 programs for players. Admissions is
entirely out of my hands. If I were to list some of the phenomenal
players that we're very interested in, one of two things happened:
Their financial aid package didn't work for their family, or they
were not admitted to Harvard.''
But for Feaster, who lived up to her billing on a national
stage, the tournament performance means a career in one of the two
professional women's leagues. The senior forward, who finished with
2,312 career points, said she will pursue professional
opportunities.
Feaster ``reminds me of a smaller version of Natalie Williams,
who's the best player in the ABL,'' Blair said. ``She could be for
women's Ivy League basketball what Bill Bradley was for the men
years ago. Before she hits Wall Street, I hope she hits the pro
leagues for a few years.''
