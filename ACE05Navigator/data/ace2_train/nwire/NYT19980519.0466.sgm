WASHINGTON _ Crucial computers at the State Department and the
Federal Aviation Administration are vulnerable to criminal or
terrorist attack because the agencies do not properly control
access to them, congressional auditors say.
The auditors, from the General Accounting Office, found that
unauthorized people could gain unsupervised access to computers at
the State Department, in person or by modem, and then steal or
destroy sensitive information, or shut the computers down.
At the aviation agency, the investigators found, the mainframe
computers that air traffic controllers use to prevent midair
collisions are not well protected against direct physical damage by
intruders or attack over modem lines.
The findings were the subject of a pair of GAO reports made
public on Tuesday at a hearing of the Senate governmental Affairs
Committee, where security experts testified.
In response, a State Department spokesman, James Rubin, said
that ``we take the GAO's findings very seriously'' and that the
department had corrected some of the vulnerabilities since
receiving a more detailed version of the auditors' report last
month.
The aviation agency, in contrast, said in a statement that
``there is little evidence to indicate any attacks on FAA's systems
or facilities to date have been anything other than common
vandalism.''
The agency's computers are aging, and the statement said that
they would be difficult for hackers to penetrate by telephone
because they are now unique to the FAA.
The auditors' report, however, said that ``while these
configurations may not be commonly understood by external hackers,
one cannot conclude that old or obscure systems are, a priori,
secure.'' And they are certainly vulnerable to attack ``by
disgruntled current and former employees who understand them,'' the
report said.
While the usual mode of hacking is over the Internet or by
telephone line directly into the target computer, the aviation
agency has a problem simply keeping its computer hardware secure,
the auditors found. The agency ``has not assessed the physical
security controls at 187 facilities since 1993,'' the report said,
``and therefore does not know how vulnerable they are.''
As for the report on the State Department, it said auditors at
department offices were able to gain top-priority access to several
systems that would have allowed them to ``view international
financial data, travel arrangements, detailed network diagrams, a
listing of valid users on local area networks, e-mail and
performance appraisals.''
The Senate committee's ranking Democrat, John Glenn of Ohio,
summed up by saying: ``We're vulnerable to terrorists, malicious
criminals, or even bored teen-agers seeing what they can hack
into.''
