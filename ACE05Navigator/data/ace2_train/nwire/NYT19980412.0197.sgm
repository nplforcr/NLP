On Christianity's holiest day, Gwyned Simpson managed to keep
her patience while waiting 45 minutes on the sidewalk for a seat in
the church she has attended all her life. The church, after all,
was Abyssinian Baptist, one of the biggest and most influential in
Harlem, and the one renowned worldwide for its gospel music.
``We have always been big,'' said Ms. Simpson, surrounded by her
four daughters, all in their Easter Sunday best. ``We have always
been famous. We were prepared.''
Every Sunday brings tourists from all over the world, but
Sunday's 11 a.m. service drew hundreds more than usual to the
church, where they pleaded and wheedled in German, Russian and
French with the 30 ushers on duty for a precious seat.
``Easter, you have the annuals,'' said Willie Williams, a church
usher, referring to members who attend church only on holidays.
``You have the regulars. And you have the tourists. It's chaos.''
Drawn by Abyssinian Baptist's choir, cited in guidebooks around
the world, as well as the grandeur of the Easter service, thousands
milled around the entire block.
One of the ushers, Jerome Wright, had to muster his high school
French to turn away a group of eager tourists. ``C'est tout,'' he
said. ``Ne pas possible. Regular members only.''
Even with its three balconies and room for about 2,800, many of
the regular members were turned away from the 9 a.m. service
because tourists had already taken the seats. But the later service
was reserved for church members.
