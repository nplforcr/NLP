CHIANG MAI, Thailand (AP) _ The Thai army is in a standoff
against more than 500 Burmese government troops who crossed into
northern Thailand in pursuit of ethnic insurgents and have refused
to retreat, a Thai border official said Friday.
The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, claimed the
Burmese troops are holding their ground about five kilometers
(three miles) inside Thailand at the Tong Na village in Pang Ma Pa
district of Mae Hong Son province.
The Burmese are claiming the right to be there on the basis that
the area has yet to be demarcated, he said. He said about 100 of
the Burmese troops have been on Thai soil since Tuesday and 400
more troops have crossed over to Thailand since then.
A Thai army official in the area, however, dismissed the
incident as ``minor,'' insisting that only several dozen Burmese
troops had ``accidentally'' crossed over on Wednesday but that Thai
soldiers had pushed them back.
He said he had sent more troops to monitor the situation, as
requested by provincial authorities, and insisted that everything
was under control.
Thai officials often downplay incidents of border tension to
avoid diplomatic wrangles with Burma.
Although Thai-Burmese relations are generally good, disputes
over the demarcation of the border, as well as the presence of
Burmese ethnic minority guerrillas, has led to a number of
confrontations.
The border official said the Burmese troops were planning to
attack guerrillas of the Shan State Army troops from Thai territory
and forced civilian refugees, who are about two kilometers (one
mile) from the border, to return to Burma.
He said the Thai army had requested help from border patrol
police and some paramilitary Ranger units, who arrived in the area
with mortars and machine guns. Several helicopters have been
requested as well, he said.
Fighting between government troops and the Shan State Army broke
out about a week ago inside Burma near the city of Homong, the
former headquarters of opium warlord Khun Sa. Khun Sa, also known
as Chang Qifu, surrendered to the Burmese government in 1996 and is
now thought to be living in Rangoon.
When Khun Sa surrendered, Burma's military government said most
of his 10-15,000 ethnic Shan troops had laid down their arms and
the area was under government control.
But recently, three separate Shan rebel armies announced they
were joining forces to continue the war against the Burmese regime.
The renewed guerrilla war has been a setback for the military
government in Rangoon, which has touted ceasefires with many ethnic
insurgent groups as one of its accomplishments.
