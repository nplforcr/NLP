BORDEAUX, France (AP) _ Lawyers charged ahead Wednesday with
final arguments in their attempts to prove former Cabinet Minister
Maurice Papon ordered the arrests that led to deportation of 1,690
Jews during World War II.
It was the third day of the marathon final arguments of some two
dozen lawyers representing of alleged victims and their families of
the roundups that occurred while Papon was the head of the Jewish
Affairs Services in the Bordeaux prefecture.
Papon, who along with his lawyers will have the chance to speak
later this month in the war crimes trial, remained silent as the
civil party lawyers made their case.
``Maurice Papon is afflicted with the syndrome of the German
shepherd: always faithful whoever is the master,'' said lawyer
Jean-Serge Lorach.
Papon maintains that he had no major power was just following
orders he received from his boss, Maurice Sabatier, who was the
prefect of Bordeaux during the war.
Raymond Blet, another civil party lawyer who spoke Wednesday,
cast in doubt Papon's claim that he actually helped the French
resistance during the war.
Papon, who was chief police inspector for the Bordeaux region
during World War II and later budget minister, is the
highest-ranking official of the pro-Nazi Vichy regime to stand
trial for complicity in crimes against humanity.
He is accused of signing the arrest orders that led to the
deportation of 1,690 Jews from Bordeaux during World War II. They
later died at the Nazi death camp at Auschwitz.
Civil party lawyers are to continue making their arguments all
this week. A verdict is expected by the end of March.
Papon's trial is now in its sixth month.
On Wednesday, seven more civil party lawyers were to address the
three judges and nine jurors with their final arguments.
