JARJOU, Lebanon (AP) _ Hezbollah guerrillas took turns Sunday to
leave the front lines in southern Lebanon and vote in municipal
elections that is likely to endorse their fight against Israeli
occupation.
Candidates backed by the pro-Iranian Shiite Hezbollah group are
contesting most of the 1,589 posts in southern Lebanon, a
predominantly Shiite region.
``I voted for Hezbollah's candidates because they are defending
our land and offering public services with or without municipal
elections,'' said Umm Mohammed, a veiled mother of two children.
The roads from Jarjou and other villages in Iqlim al-Tuffah
province were festooned with the Hezbollah's banners and flags as
well as portraits of Iran's late revolutionary leader, Ayatollah
Khomeini.
Iqlim al-Tuffah is a Hezbollah mountain stronghold that faces
the part of South Lebanon that Israel occupies with the help of a
Lebanese militia. Hezbollah has led the fight to oust the Israelis.
``Today's voting is part of the resistance against Israeli
occupation,'' said Fawzi Darwish, a 34-year-old businessman in
Jarjou, which is only 400 meters (yards) from Israeli outposts at
Sojod. Darwish said he voted for pro-Hezbollah candidates.
No voting was held in the Israeli-occupied area.
Zeinab Khafaja, who lost her guerrilla brother to a battle
against the Israelis, said it was her holy duty to vote for
Hezbollah.
``It's a vote between the good and evil,'' said the 35-year-old
mother of four.
Hezbollah fighters also participated in the elections, leaving
their weapons at the front line to walk unarmed to the polling
booths.
Guerrilla leaders rotated the fighters to make sure that the
front line was not unmanned at any time, said Haj Adnan Naameh, a
Hezbollah official, in nearby Jubaa, home to 4,000 people.
``The fighter has a primary right to vote,'' he said.
The front lines were generally quiet Sunday and voting was
peaceful as troops in armored vehicles patrolled the villages and
guarded polling stations.
But the electoral battle was heated between Hezbollah and the
pro-Syrian mainstream Amal movement, also a Shiite group. The
victorious group will be seen as the voice of the nation's Shiites
who number 1.2 million among Lebanon's 3.2 million people.
Besides the Shiite fight, the elections _ the first municipal
polls in 35 years _ also are seen as proof that Lebanon's
Christians and Muslims are willing to join hands in building
democracy after the devastating 1975-90 civil war.
Voting was also held Sunday in Beirut, 50 kilometers (30 miles)
northwest of Jarjou. The vote was the third segment of the
four-stage elections organized over four consecutive Sundays.
