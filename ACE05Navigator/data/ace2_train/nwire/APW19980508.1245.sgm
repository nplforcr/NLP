KUALA LUMPUR, Thurs. - The 20 crew members including seven
Malaysians of the Petro Ranger fuel tanker anchored off the island
of Hainan, China, are helping the Chinese authorities in the
investigation pertaining to the ship's disappearance on April 16 en
route to Vietnam.
Malaysia's ambassador to China, Datuk Abdul Majid Ahmad Khan,
said the crew members were confined to the vessel at the Haikou
port in Hainan since it was intercepted by Chinese maritime police
on April 26 on suspicion of smuggling.
He said the Malaysian consul-general's office in Guongzhou,
China, was negotiating with the Chinese authorities in Hainan for
the quick release of the crew.
``I have been informed that they are in good condition and that
the Chinese authorities have given permission for them to contact
their families in Malaysia,'' tha ambassador said when contacted at
his office today.
Asked when the seamen would be released, Abdul Majid said it was
up to the Chinese authorities but he assured the families that they
would do everything possible to speed up their release.
The Petro Ranger was reported missing by its agent, Singapore
Petroships Pte Ltd, a day after it sailed from Singapore on April
16 for Ho Chi Minh City in southern Vietnam.
