 For the world, this is Pamela McCall in the BBC news room in London. The
 United Nations secretary general Kofi Annan has confirmed that he is
 sending a two man technical team to Iraq to establish the location and
 extent
 of eight sites from which UN weapons inspectors have been denied access.
 The
 BBC's UN's correspondent says diplomats are puzzled by the move, which was
 strongly criticized by the US and Britain when Mr. Annan first floated
 the
 idea on Wednesday. Russia has presented a new proposal to the UN security
 council to try to end the deadlock, but President Clinton has made it clear
 that differences with Russia would not prevent Washington taking military
 action if necessary.

 I am still working with the uh Russians, the French, the United Nations,
 anybody
 to try to find a diplomatic solution. The difference here is that I simply
 do
 not believe it is acceptable to permit Iraq to walk away from its
 obligations.
 uh We don't believe it is an- i- acceptable if diplomacy fails to walk away.
