GARDEN CITY, N.Y. _ Clearing an important hurdle, Gov. George
Pataki Wednesday won a federal agency's approval of his plan for a
$7.8 billion partial state takeover of Long Island Lighting Co., a
proposal that is intended to cut electricity rates by an average of
19.4 percent.
Pataki's aides said the approval, which was granted unanimously
by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in Washington, was a
major advance. The commission's ruling is among several Government
approvals required to enact the plan.
But the plan's entrenched foes seized on a companion decision by
the commission in which it ordered hearings on whether to approve
the wholesale prices that Lilco would charge for the power its
generating plants would supply to the state in the takeover plan.
The critics vowed to continue their fight on that issue and in
other regulatory proceedings.
The governor, who is running for a second term, faces a
practical deadline for reaping the maximum political benefit from
the takeover. He hopes to complete the complex deal by November _
in time to issue a pre-election cut in electricity bills and to
mail all customers refund checks of $101 apiece in Suffolk County
and $232 in Nassau County and the Rockaways in Queens.
That would be a campaign coup for Pataki, who owed much of his
1994 election victory margin to his strong showing on Long Island.
He promised to confront Lilco's electric bills _ now the highest in
North America _ which rank as a top voter concern here.
Under the Pataki plan, the state's Long Island Power Authority
would buy Lilco's transmission and distribution lines and customer
service operations. Lilco would be hired to manage the system and
supply power for several years before those functions would be
opened to competitive bids.
The savings would derive from tax-exempt bonds to refinance
Lilco's debt, including the cost of its abandoned nuclear plant at
Shoreham, and from postponed debt payment.
But the critics, who include a bipartisan core of state and
county legislators in Suffolk as well as several civic,
environmental and business groups, assert that the Pataki plan is a
bad deal. They say it benefits Lilco stockholders, bails out the
Shoreham fiasco, burdens electricity customers with more than $20
billion in debt and stifles competition just when the rest of the
nation is being deregulated.
Richard M. Kessel, the chairman of the Long Island Power
Authority, praised the approval. ``This is clearly a major step
forward for the governor's plan,'' Kessel said. ``We're hopeful
that we can close the transaction soon, so electric consumers on
Long Island can begin to benefit from lower electric rates in the
near future.''

But one opponent of the plan, Wayne Prospect, a former Suffolk
County legislator and now a consultant to the Hauppauge Industrial
Association, accused Kessel of distorting the energy commission's
actions. ``What Lipa is trying to do, shamelessly, is tell the
public this is a done deal when it is far from it,'' Prospect said.
In a draft of its order for a review of prices in the
power-supply contract, the five-member energy commission said
hearings were necessary to protect the interests of Lilco's
customers. ``Our preliminary analysis of the proposed rate
indicates that it has not been shown to be just and reasonable, and
may be unjust, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory or preferential
or otherwise unlawful.''
Although the commission's hearings could take months, Kessel
said that its review was a standard procedure. He said there was
nothing to stop the governor's plan from proceeding in advance of
the hearings, with retroactive adjustments made according to
anything that the federal commission might impose.
Although Kessel claimed that the commission's review could not
upset the governor's plan, the opponents disputed him and said the
plan was still vulnerable.
Now the plan's proponents are focusing on their next goal of
winning favorable rulings from the Internal Revenue Service, Kessel
said. Pataki is bolstered by the bipartisan support of New York's
two senators, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a Democrat, and Alfonse
D'Amato, a Republican.
The governor's plan seems to have gained momentum lately. Last
week, the state Public Service Commission approved Lilco's planned
merger with Brooklyn Union Gas, which advocates consider an allied
move that will add to the potential rate savings.
While opposition to the Pataki plan has grown in Suffolk,
bipartisan backing for it is now emerging in neighboring Nassau. In
a rare split between the two counties, Nassau officials last month
went to court supporting the plan as intervenors in litigation
filed by the Suffolk County Legislature to block it.
