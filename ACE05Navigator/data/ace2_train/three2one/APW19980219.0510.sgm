	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The Polish Embassy, which represents U.S.
interests in Iraq, evacuated the majority of its diplomats
Thursday, the same day buses of U.N. relief workers left the Iraqi
capital as a precaution against a possible U.S. attack if U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan's peace mission fails.
	   The embassy, which represented U.S. interests since the 1991
Gulf War, evacuated 10 of its 16 diplomats. The Polish ambassador
and another diplomat who works on behalf of the United States were
among those staying behind.
	   Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, meanwhile, sent a message to
Russian President Boris Yeltsin saying he remains committed to a
diplomatic solution to the impasse over U.N. weapons inspections,
the official Iraqi News Agency reported. The Russian leader has
been one of the loudest opponents to any use of force to end the
standoff.
	   An U.N. advance team of about 20 people arrived at Habbaniya
airport west of Baghdad on Thursday to prepare for Annan's arrival
Friday.
	   Annan, who won the blessing of the U.N. Security Council on
Wednesday night for the diplomatic mission, said he was leaving
with a ``reasonable chance of success'' and plans to meet with
Saddam.
	   Despite the optimistic talk of a breakthrough, 29 U.N. employees
loaded their gear into buses in Baghdad on Thursday and headed to
Amman, Jordan. Denis Halliday, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator
for Iraq, said roughly the same number would leave Friday. Two
other employees were going to northern Iraq under Kurdish control.
