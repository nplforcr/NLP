JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's battered currency and
stock prices dropped through important psychological barriers
Tuesday, and a senior Cabinet minister backed predictions that the
inflation rate would hit at least 85 percent by year's end.
Indonesia has been hardest hit by Asia's financial meltdown and
is enduring its worst economic crisis in decades.
Mines and Energy Minister Kuntoro Mangkusubroto said a
prediction of 85 percent inflation, made by the government's
statistician last week, was ``optimistic.''
Annual inflation is currently running at 49 percent.
The rupiah has lost more than 80 percent of its value since the
crisis struck last July.
On Tuesday, it broke through 15,000 rupiahs against the U.S.
dollar.
In late trading, the dollar was quoted at 15,200 rupiahs
compared with Monday's close of 14,550 rupiahs.
The Jakarta Stock Exchange's main index closed down 1.7 percent
at 399.512 points, under the 400-point mark.
Analysts attribute the sinking currency and stock values to
escalating worries over Indonesia's economic and political
stability.
