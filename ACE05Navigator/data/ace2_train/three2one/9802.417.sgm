Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said yesterday she will report to 
President Clinton that none of the six Arab leaders she consulted this week 
expressed outright opposition to the use of force against Iraq. A senior 
official traveling with her suggested that some were openly supportive in 
private. 

In an eight-nation trip through Europe and the Middle East, Albright spoke to 
leaders of Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Kuwait, Bahrain and the Palestinian 
Authority. 

"We talked about various implications of using force but . . . I underline that 
none of the Arab leaders, specifically, urged me to tell the president not to 
use force," she said to reporters aboard her aircraft en route back to 
Washington. 

Albright has stated throughout the trip that the United States is informing 
allies of its intentions but is not canvassing for support or asking permission 
to enforce the disarmament conditions set by the U.N. Security Council at the 
close of the 1991 Persian Gulf War. But it is central to the Clinton 
administration's strategy now to portray itself as the head of a unified 
"international community," and Albright found time for a news conference every 
day of the trip in which she recapitulated the support she had received. 

Earlier, in Egypt, Albright said all six Arab governments agreed on the central 
components of the American public rationale for military action: that Iraqi 
President Saddam Hussein created the present crisis by defying U.N. weapons 
inspectors, that diplomacy is the preferred way to secure his compliance, and 
that grave consequences would follow from diplomacy's failure. 

"In a Security Council resolution, 'grave consequences' is a very significant 
statement," said a senior U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
"Grave consequences" means that these leaders are all talking about the possible 
use of force and blaming that potential outcome on Saddam Hussein, the official 
said. 

After a week in which Egypt has voiced its opposition openly to any kind of 
military strike against Baghdad, Cairo's measured support marked a clear 
softening in tone on the part of a key U.S. ally in the Middle East. 

In Bahrain, earlier in the day, the government became the third in the Persian 
Gulf region -- after Saudi Arabia and Kuwait -- to associate itself with 
American threats of military force in the confrontation over U.N. inspection of 
Iraqi weapons. U.S. officials said Albright encountered no unexpected opposition 
to the use of American combat jets based at the Sheik Isa Air Base there if the 
United States decides to bomb Iraq. 

Washington's Arab allies are far from enthusiastic at the prospect of U.S. 
airstrikes against Iraq. Public opinion in Arab countries is deeply sympathetic 
to the Iraqi people, if not to the regime of Saddam Hussein, and pro-Western 
Arab states are united in emphasizing the need for a diplomatic solution to the 
standoff. 

Adding to diplomatic efforts by France, Russia and Turkey, Egyptian President 
Hosni Mubarak has spent the last several days telephoning fellow Arab leaders to 
draft a message that will be carried to Saddam Hussein in Baghdad Wednesday by 
Arab League Secretary General Esmat Abdel Meguid. 

Except for Bahrain and Kuwait, none of Washington's Arab allies has given 
assurances that it would cooperate in military operations against Iraq should 
diplomatic efforts fail. Saudi Arabia is considering a U.S. request to permit 
American bombers to fly through its airspace en route to Iraq, and American 
support aircraft, such as refueling planes, to fly from Saudi bases. 

At the same time, U.S. officials said they have been gratified by expressions of 
support from such key Arab leaders as Jordan's King Hussein and Saudi Arabia's 
Crown Prince Abdullah. After Abdullah and Albright met for six hours Monday, the 
Saudi government agreed in a statement that the failure of diplomatic efforts 
would "lead to grave consequences whose responsibility would lie exclusively on 
the Iraqi regime." 

Emerging with Albright from a meeting with Mubarak at Ittihadiya Palace in Cairo 
this evening, Foreign Minister Amr Moussa used similar language in comments to 
reporters. "It is very important that there would be full compliance" with the 
U.N. inspections, Moussa said, adding that the two governments agree on the need 
to exhaust all diplomatic avenues "in order to avoid grave consequences." 

Asked whether Egypt was prepared to back military force against Iraq if 
diplomacy fails, Moussa replied, "I'm not ready to go beyond that for the time 
being." 

Albright said, "we welcome the fact that others are making an effort to get a 
diplomatic solution. But I also have to say that I am skeptical about it given 
the kinds of responses that Saddam Hussein has already given to a number of 
envoys that have gone there." She repeated previous warnings that any military 
strike against Iraq would be "significant." 

[Russia said it was continuing to make progress in its mediation efforts in 
Baghdad despite an Iraqi denial Monday of concessions reported in Moscow. French 
envoy Bertrand Dufourcq arrived in the Iraqi capital with a message from French 
President Jacques Chirac for Saddam Hussein that he planned to deliver on 
Wednesday. British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, meanwhile, announced plans to 
visit Saudi Arabia and Kuwait this week to discuss the crisis as Kuwait put its 
military on higher alert.] 

In military terms, Egyptian cooperation would make little difference to the 
United States, which has concentrated most of its firepower on aircraft carriers 
and land bases in the Persian Gulf region. As the largest and arguably most 
influential Arab country, however, Egypt can play a crucial role in providing 
the administration with political cover as it did when it participated in the 
U.S.-led coalition to drive Iraqi troops from Kuwait in the 1991 Persian Gulf 
War. 

The U.S. case for military action was not helped by a recent comment attributed 
to chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler to the effect that Saddam Hussein 
has enough biological weapons to "blow away Tel Aviv" -- language he later said 
was taken out of context. 

Echoing comments by Mubarak, Egypt's semiofficial Al Ahram newspaper said in a 
lead editorial today that Butler's comment "confirmed the beliefs of Arab 
citizens that the goal of the U.N. committee is not to implement the U.N. 
resolutions but to paralyze Iraq for Israel's benefit." 

But Albright's conversation with Mubarak appears to have softened Egyptian 
objections, at least for now. 

Appearing alongside Albright in Bahrain this morning, Foreign Minister Mohammed 
Bin Mubarak Khalifa repeated several elements of the formula that Albright has 
pressed in her eight-nation diplomatic campaign. He warned that failure to reach 
a diplomatic solution would have serious consequences and that Iraq would be the 
responsible party.
