 What does the international media have to say about the investigation into
 President Clinton?
 Steve Nettleton takes a look.

 To much of the world, the media feeding frenzy into the president's alleged
 sexual affairs has become an international soap opera.
<time sec="399.495">
 It has produced chuckles abroad from those who see it as another example of
 puritanical US moral values interfering in government.
 Of course, the case goes beyond sex.
 It involves criminal accusations of lying under oath and trying to cover it
 up,
<time sec="413.907">
 allegations often overlooked by readers and viewers outside the
 United States.

 uh, I think they probably have a hard time uh making the distinction between the
 fact that on the one hand there is the sexual aspects of the scandal that
 are played up by the media,
<time sec="429.264">
 and on the other hand, the more serious charges
 of perjury and obstruction of justice.

 But in many countries, the idea of even questioning a president about his
 sex life is ridiculous.
 Late French president Francios Mitterrand carried on a long affair with a
 former campaign volunteer and fathered a daughter with her.
<time sec="446.806">
 Many in the French media knew about it, but kept it secret.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="450.188" endTime="466.301">
 th- The people who did know ah choose not to report on it, because it was thought
 to be the private life of the president, and in no way had it anything to
 do with the way he was conducting the affairs of state.

 In Japan, politicians' sexual liaisons go largely ignored by the media and
 the public, as long as they are kept quiet.
<time sec="473.865">
 But if they become headlines, they can be politically damaging.
 In November, Japanese tabloids announced an alleged sexual affair between
 Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and a Chinese embassy employee in the
 nineteen eighties.
<time sec="486.491">
 The tabloids called the woman a Chinese spy and suggested the relationship
 was a threat to national security.
 Hashimoto denied the affair and it has had little effect on his office.
 One of his predecessors was not so lucky.
<time sec="500.713">
 Former Japanese Prime Minister Sousuke Uno resigned two months after taking
 office in nineteen eighty-nine following reports he had paid numerous hostesses
 called geishas to serve as his mistresses.
<time sec="511.638">
 Even then, the Japanese were more shocked that Uno didn't keep his
 mistresses quiet and the geishas' public complaints made him appear weak.
<time sec="519.201">
 Can Bill Clinton survive the whirlwind of lurid sexual details and criminal
 accusations swirling around the Oval Office?
 International leaders will be watching carefully, wondering whether it will
 set a new precedent for politicians worldwide.
