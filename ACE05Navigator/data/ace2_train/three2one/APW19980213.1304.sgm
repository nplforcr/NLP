&UR; Iraqi minister rebutts Sandy Berger's allegations &QL;

<TEXT>
BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's deputy foreign minister attacked
U.S. National Security Advisor Sandy Berger Friday, accusing him of
``lies and deception.''
Riyadh al-Qaysi picked his way through Berger's press conference
in Washington hours earlier, criticizing the security advisor's
assertion that Iraq had been repeatedly in ``material breach'' of
U.N. Security Council resolutions.
``Iraq challenges (Berger) to produce one Security Council
resolution using those two words,'' al-Qaysi told reporters in
Baghdad.
He said that Berger might not have been concerned with reality,
because he had indicated that if the United States did not have the
Security Council's unanimous support for a military strike, it
would go ahead anyway.
``Everybody knows that under the charter of the United Nations,
the five permanent members have a special responsibility for the
maintenance of international peace and security and there are three
permanent members _ namely Russia, France and China _ who do not
want war, so unanimity does not exist,'' al-Qaysi said.
The deputy foreign minister accused Berger of being part of a
campaign against Iraq.
``This campaign is being conducted on the basis of lies and
deception and should not be taken by anyone in the world as being a
justifiable basis for war.''
``This is exactly what the United States, as supported by the
United Kingdom, are trying to achieve.''
