NAGANO, Japan _ The final Winter Olympics of the 20th century
opened Saturday with a spare, traditional celebration of Japanese
culture that broadened into an idealistic call for international
peace and brotherhood.
With a U.S. military attack on Iraq possibly imminent, the
president of the International Olympic Committee called on all
nations to refrain from conflict during the 16 days of the Winter
Games.
It was his hope, said Juan Antonio Samaranch, that the IOC's
appeal for a worldwide Olympic truce ``will foster international
dialogue and diplomatic solutions to all conflicts, in an effort to
bring human tragedies to an end.''
After 2,450 athletes from 72 countries marched into Minami
Stadium, and the revered Japanese figure skater Midori Ito lighted
the Olympic flame, nearly 20 minutes of the two-hour opening
ceremony were devoted to a soaring performance of Beethoven's ``Ode
to Joy.''
The climactic movement of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony is
performed at every Olympics, according to the wishes of Pierre de
Coubertin, the French baron who is considered the father of the
modern Olympic movement. But Saturday's performance was
particularly ambitious and stirring as it incorporated both musical
and technological virtuosity of the highest order.
As 50,000 spectators gathered under a milky midday sky,
jubilantly filling a stadium ringed by the majestic Japan Alps,
``Ode to Joy'' was performed by choruses from five continents,
linked simultaneously by satellite and symbolizing the interlocking
Olympic rings.
Seiji Ozawa, music director of the Boston Symphony Orchestra,
conducted 200-member choruses in New York; Berlin; Beijing; Sydney,
Australia; and Cape Point, South Africa. They were all connected by
time-lag technology to 90 singers in the Nagano Prefecture Culture
Hall and 2,000 singers at the opening-ceremony stadium.
The performance, accompanied by 80 ballet dancers ringing the
floor of the stadium, was an inspiring, if temporary, validation of
the symphonic and Olympic ideal that all men will become brothers.
The themes of transporting unity and accord into the 21st
century resonated throughout the opening ceremony. Some 2,000
balloons shaped like doves were released into the air, carrying
messages of peace written by the children of Nagano. An underlying
message in the third postwar Olympic Games in Japan is the
country's desire to reckon with an expansionist past by promoting a
future of peace and friendship.
``The Japanese have a considerable responsibility for the wars
of the first half of the century,'' Keita Asari, the executive
producer of the opening ceremony, told reporters earlier this week.
``From that perspective, peace in the century ahead has a
particular significance.''
The opening ceremony avoided ostentation in favor of simplicity,
hospitality and efficiency. As well as a festival of solidarity and
athleticism, the Nagano Games are viewed as a homage to the beauty
of nature. The exterior of the opening-ceremony stadium is shaped
like petals of a cherry blossom, Japan's national flower.
Saturday's ceremony began with the solemn ringing of a bell from
the Zenkoji temple, the spiritual heart of Nagano. Eight wooden
pillars, hewn from trees felled in local forests, were erected in
pairs to signify the four gates of the stadium.
Akebono, the massive grand champion sumo wrestler, then entered
the stadium to perform a purification ritual. Dressed in a
loincloth in the 30-degree chill, the 6-foot-8-inch, 516-pound
wrestler stamped his feet to drive out evil spirits, symbolically
readying the Nagano Games for contests of sportsmanship and fair
play.
``Being from Hawaii, I don't know too much about the Winter
Olympics,'' said Akebono, a native of Oahu whose given name is Chad
Rowan. ``It's exciting. We're probably the first sumo wrestlers to
ever be in the opening ceremonies.''
Sumo wrestlers also accompanied each of the 72 Olympic
delegations into the stadium, walking hand in hand with
schoolchildren. The children wore sweaters bearing the flag colors
of the country that they were escorting. Included in the parade of
nations were Kenya, Azerbaijan, Venezuela, Macedonia and Uruguay,
which were all participating in the Winter Games for the first
time.
Carrying the flag for the U.S. delegation, which consists of 196
athletes, was the four-time Olympian Eric Flaim, a speed skater who
has previously won two silver medals. He seemed a curious choice to
many, considering that Flaim qualified as a pool member of the
short-track relay team and may not compete at these Winter Games.
Flaim, 30, of Boston, said he was dedicating his flag-carrying
honor to his late father, Rico, who got him involved in winter
sports.
Greeting the Japanese delegation from the royal box were Emperor
Akihito and Empress Michiko. The country has enjoyed limited
success in the Winter Games, and its most famous medalists played
significant roles in the opening ceremony.
Yukio Kasaya, a ski jumper and the only Japanese athlete to win
an individual gold medal in the Winter Games, helped carry the
Olympic flag into the stadium. Kenji Ogiwara, who won two gold
medals as part of the Nordic combined team event, delivered the
athletes' oath. And Ito, whose silver medal at the 1992 Winter
Games is the only medal ever won by a Japanese figure skater,
lighted the Olympic cauldron dressed in a traditional Japanese
robe.

Preliminary rounds of the Olympic hockey tournament began after
Saturday's opening ceremony, with the first full day of competition
set for Sunday in the men's downhill, snowboarding, speed skating
and the pairs short program in figure skating. Heavy snow is
forecast, which could force a postponement of the downhill.
After exorbitant budget increases, early lack of public support
and a bitter controversy over placing the start of the downhill in
an environmentally sensitive national park, the Nagano Games began
with a sense of anticipation and relief.
``The Games will work,'' said Anita DeFrantz of the United
States, the only woman to serve as vice president of the IOC.
``Nobody thought they would, but they will.''
While transportation concerns persist in this clogged city of
360,000, IOC members seemed satisfied that Nagano would avoid the
traffic and technological failures of the 1996 Summer Games in
Atlanta.
``This shows you can actually plan an Olympic Games ahead of
time and not write code as the spaceship is heading toward the
moon,'' said Dick Pound, an influential IOC member from Montreal.
What remains to be seen is whether the IOC appeals for an
Olympic truce will hold during the Nagano Games, which end Feb. 22.
The Japanese foreign minister, Keizo Obuchi, has urged the United
States to refrain from hostilities with Iraq during what he called
the ``last sports festival of peace this century.''
