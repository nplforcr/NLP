AT&T Corp. is selling its electronic paging business to Alexandria-based paging 
giant Metrocall Inc. for $ 205 million in stock and cash, company sources said 
last night. 

The move marks AT&T's exit from the paging business, freeing the company to 
focus its wireless activities on its more profitable cellular telephone 
business. It also would help, albeit in a small way, to provide the company with 
some of the cash it needs to buy cable giant Tele-Communications Inc. 

The deal is the latest in a string of acquisitions for Metrocall, the nation's 
second-largest paging company with 4.1 million subscribers. Metrocall employs 
3,000 people, including 605 in the Washington area. 

Metrocall will pay $ 110 million in cash and $ 95 million in preferred shares 
for AT&T's paging services, Metrocall officials said. 

William L. Collins III, president and chief executive of Metrocall, said the two 
companies were in talks last fall, but Metrocall ended discussions because 
AT&T's price was too high. 

As part of the deal, Metrocall gets a nationwide two-way paging license for 
which AT&T paid $ 80 million at a federal auction in 1994, though AT&T never 
developed the two-way paging service. Metrocall also gets a five-year exclusive 
agreement to sell its paging products in AT&T Wireless retail stores under its 
own brand name. 

"AT&T is pleased that the advanced messaging division will be an important part 
of Metrocall's overall strategy," said Dan Sommers, AT&T's chief financial 
officer. 

AT&T acquired its advanced messaging division, which employees 1,000 people, as 
part of its $ 11.5 billion purchase of McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. in 
1995. 

Selling off AT&T's paging unit is one of a series of moves made by the company's 
new chairman, C. Michael Armstrong, to streamline the nation's largest phone 
company and move it into new profit areas. AT&T shares took a beating last week 
after the company announced plans to buy TCI for $ 48 billion in stock and 
assumed debt. Analysts expressed concern that AT&T would have to spend too much 
money to upgrade TCI's cable systems to make them capable of handling telephone 
and Internet service. 

The paging deal furthers an acquisition frenzy that has characterized the 
industry over the past several years. Large paging companies, seeking to reduce 
costs and enhance profitability, typically buy out smaller ones and take on 
their customers. 

Metrocall has led that trend, making purchases of a half-dozen paging companies 
in the past few years, including rival ProNet Inc. last year. 

With 4.1 million subscribers as of March 31, Metrocall ranks behind Paging 
Network of Plano, Tex., among the nation's largest paging companies. With 1.2 
million subscribers, AT&T's paging operations would rank 10th in the nation if 
it were a stand-alone operation. 

Bulking up has been a costly strategy for Metrocall, however. The company 
reported a net loss of $ 52.5 million in 1997 and lost $ 28.2 million its first 
quarter of 1998, which was more than double the loss posted a year earlier. 
Company officials attributed the losses to the cost of Metrocall's acquisition 
strategy. The company's sales grew 59 percent in the first quarter, to $ 96.3 
million. 

Still, the AT&T deal might not be enough to maintain Metrocall's No. 2 position 
for long. Arch Communications Group Inc., the third largest paging company with 
4 million subscribers, recently announced that it was in talks to buy rival 
MobileMedia Corp., which filed for bankruptcy protection more than a year ago. 
MobileMedia is the fourth-largest company, with 3.3 million customers.
