 Edward Kennedy met with both sides today, the British government and Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams, just as a new peace plan leaked out. The British government will reportedly propose a new Northern Ireland assembly as well as a Council of the Isles, that would include representatives from England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. But that proposal falls well short of what Irish Catholics working for one, united, Ireland want.

 The peace talks resume in Belfast on Monday. Both the minister's dramatic prison visit and today's new proposal are designed to give those peace talks a chance. Richard Gizbert, ABC News, London.
