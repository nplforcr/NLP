NEW YORK _ A Brooklyn teen-ager charged with killing a high
school student during a brawl at last year's St. Patrick's Day
parade was acquitted of all counts Wednesday by a Manhattan jury.
Jason Andrade, 19, of Bay Ridge, was found not guilty of charges
that he beat Michael Sarti, 18, into a coma. Sarti, a high school
senior who lived in the Throgs Neck section of the Bronx, died of
his injuries three weeks after the attack. Although prosecutors
claimed that Andrade delivered a fatal kick to Sarti, the defense
managed to raise questions about descriptions of the attacker by
witnesses.
``It was justice,'' Andrade said after the trial. ``Justice
prevailed.''
The verdict was announced in a courtroom crowded with members of
both families. While defense supporters sagged with relief, members
of Sarti's family cried that the acquittal was an injustice.
Sarti's brother, Jimmy Watt, leaped to his feet and had to be
restrained by court officers as the jury forewoman read ``not
guilty'' to the 11th and final count. Sarti's mother screamed,
``They all have his blood on their hands,'' as she left the
courtroom.
Prosecutors said Sarti was beaten just after 2 p.m. last March
17 during an alcohol-fueled brawl a block east of the parade route,
at 59th Street and Madison Avenue. The fighting that led to Sarti's
death was the culmination of a series of street battles between
groups of teen-agers from Brooklyn and the Bronx, prosecutors said.
They claimed that the fatal assault ended with Andrade kicking
Sarti in the head as he lay on the pavement.
But defense lawyers produced medical experts who questioned
whether such a kick could have led to Sarti's death. More
significantly, the defense lawyers were able to raise questions
about varying descriptions of the attacker, focusing on details
like whether the man wore a hat and the color of his hair. Although
prosecutors had a videotape of portions of the fight, there was no
tape that showed the final assault on Sarti.
One juror, Anthony Sbordoni, 51, said after the verdict that
questions about the identification decided the case during the two
half-days of deliberations.
``There was not enough substantial evidence regarding the
identification,'' he said. ``There was no consistency.''
After the verdict, Andrade's lawyer, Raphael Scotto, said that
Andrade and his family felt compassion for the Sartis.
``It was a fair verdict based on the evidence,'' Scotto said.
``The verdict does not take away in any part from the fact that the
Andrade family has great sympathy for the Sarti family.''
Andrade's father, Robert, said the family was relieved that his
son was freed, but that there would be no celebrating.
``There is no celebration here,'' he said. ``A boy is dead.''
The beating took place during an intensive effort by the
Giuliani administration and the Police Department to curtail
drinking and violence at the annual St. Patrick's Day Parade. Chris
Bonaiuto, 18, who worked with Sarti at a Bronx hobby shop,
expressed dismay with the verdict.
``It shows people that you can go to a parade and hurt somebody
and get away with it,'' Bonaiuto said. ``It's totally unfair.''
