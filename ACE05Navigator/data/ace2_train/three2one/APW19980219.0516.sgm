	   DURA, West Bank (AP) _ Israeli policemen fired live rounds in
the air Thursday to disperse hundreds of young Palestinians who
blocked a major West Bank road to show their support for Saddam
Hussein.
	   The confrontation began when elementary and high school students
marched and burned Israeli and U.S. flags in Dura, a West Bank town
that remains under Israeli security control.
	   At one point, the marchers blocked the main road running through
Dura with boulders, and hurled rocks at an Israeli police van and
settler cars. The four policemen in the van called for backup and
then fired in the air with pistols and assault rifles.
	   Three more vans and an Israeli army jeep arrived a few minutes
later. There were no immediate reports of injury.
	   After a while, the shooting stopped and Israeli soldiers began
firing tear gas and rubber bullets at the demonstrators. Troops
chased stone throwers into the fields. Two Palestinians were
injured by rubber bullets and six were overcome by tear gas.
	   The incident marked the most serious confrontation between
Israeli troops and Palestinians since pro-Iraq demonstrations began
in the West Bank several weeks ago.
	   The rallies often ended in stone throwing clashes, but until now
Israeli troops have fired only rubber bullets, not live ammunition.
The Palestinian Authority has banned pro-Iraq rallies, but that ban
has been widely ignored.
	   The Palestinian Authority has also prohibited Palestinian radio
and television stations from broadcasting commentary in support of
Saddam or footage of demonstrations. The ban came under pressure
from the United States.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who paid a heavy price for his
open support of Saddam during the 1991 Gulf War, has been carefully
neutral in his statements, saying he would like to see a diplomatic
solution to the conflict.
	   In the West Bank town of Ramallah, Palestinian police prevented
a planned pro-Iraq rally by the Palestinian Professionals' Union.
Police told organizers they would be breaking the law if they went
ahead and the marchers left quietly.
	   The march in Dura began Thursday morning with about 800 school
students waving Iraqi and Palestinian flags and urging Saddam
Hussein to fire missiles at Israel.
	   ``With our spirit and our blood, we will redeem Iraq,'' and
``Saddam, Saddam, our beloved, hit Tel Aviv,'' shouted the about
800 elementary and high school students.
	   Demonstrators burned six Israeli and two U.S. flags and several
held up a banner reading ``Why do the Iraqi people have to pay the
price for Clinton's affairs?''
