 Across the country fans are mourning Frank Sinatra who died from a heart
 attack overnight in Los Angeles. He was eighty-two. Tributes poured in from
 friends and celebrities including Bono of the Irish rock band U two who
 credited Sinatra with inventing pop music. Officials at the Empire State
 Building in New York said they'll honor Sinatra by illuminating the top of
 the building with blue light all weekend. The singer was born across the
 river from New York in Hoboken, New Jersey.
