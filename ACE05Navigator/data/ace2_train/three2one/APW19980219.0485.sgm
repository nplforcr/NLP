	   ROME (AP) _ The Italian government will ask U.S. authorities for
jurisdiction in probing the role of the four-man crew of the Marine
jet which severed a ski gondola cable, Justice Minister Giovanni
Maria Flick told the Chamber of Deputies Thursday.
	   By snapping the cable, the jet, on a training run Feb. 3 from
the U.S. air base of Aviano, in northeast Italy, sent the cable car
smashing into a mountain at an Alpine resort, killing all 20 aboard
the gondola.
	   If Italy receives jurisdiction and decides to indict the crew,
the four could stand trial on charges of multiple manslaughter and
endangering transport.
	   The crew returned safely to base after the accident and
expressed sympathy in a statement to the victim's families.
	   Under NATO's 1951 Status of Forces Agreement, Italy may make
such a request, and ``the U.S. will give full consideration'' to
the request, said an Aviano spokesman, Tech. Sgt. Bill Lincicome.
	   But the chances that U.S. authorities will let the Italians
decide the judicial fate of the crew seemed slim.
	   Lincicome noted that there has been no precedent for a NATO
member surrendering jurisdiction in a probe involving the carrying
out of official duty.
	   Italy's request will be made in the next few days via the
foreign ministry.
	   Italy was seeking jurisdiction, Flick told the deputies, given
the gravity of the tragedy and ``the enormous impression on the
Italian population, which has shown the strong desire that justice
be carried out in our country.''
	   The request comes at a sensitive time, with some small leftist
parties which support Premier Romano Prodi's government opposing
U.S. use of Italian or NATO bases in Italy should there be a strike
against Iraq.
	   Flick said the request took into consideration the ``loyal and
reciprocal cooperation between the Italian and U.S. authorities.''
	   The minister indicated that Italy might ask jurisdiction to
probe the role of other Americans attached to Aviano, but that a
final decision hadn't been made on that.
	   Italian and American militaries are conducting a joint
investigation to determine whether any of the jet's crew or its
commanding officers should face charges.
	   Italian civilian prosecutors are conducting a separate
investigation but will be powerless to try the crew unless American
authorities give up jurisdiction.
	   On Wednesday, Italian news reports said that the jet was well
below its approved altitude when the accident happened.
	   A team of experts appointed by an Italian prosecutor, according
to the news agency ANSA, contends the EA-6B Prowler sped between
two sets of cables which were 260 feet (85 meters) from the ground
at the lowest point and 400 feet (125 meters) at the highest.
	   The Pentagon has acknowledged that a book used by U.S. military
pilots specifically states that pilots in the area where the ski
lift is located were to maintain a minimum altitude of 1,000 feet
(300 meters).
	   Flick said Italy will advance the compensation for the victims,
with the United States eventually reimbursing Italy for 75 percent
of the costs.
