HAKUBA, Japan _ This time, the men's downhill actually got a
couple of skiers out of the start before the race was postponed.
Unfortunately, they were only the runners who test the mountain,
and when one of them skied off the course in a steady downpour of
pellet-like rain, arms went up in disgust, jackets went on, helmets
came off and the nightmare of a weather-plagued Alpine Olympics
continued.
Six days into the Nagano Games, one Alpine event _ the women's
super-G won on Wednesday by Picabo Street of the United States _
has been completed. The men's downhill, traditionally the Sunday
kickoff and Alpine's premier event, has suddenly become just
another race to squeeze into a schedule that has become woefully
backed up as the Games move toward the end of the first week. The
event has gone from Sunday's original date to a Wednesday
rescheduling that was changed to Thursday. When the race was called
again around midday, with a steady rain falling, Olympic organizers
went back to the drawing board to recast the schedule yet again,
moving the race to Friday.
Also postponed Thursday was the men's combined downhill, which
held its two slalom runs on Tuesday in a swirling snowstorm,
despite many of the skiers' objections. The combined downhill was
moved to Friday along with the regular men's downhill, forcing
postponement of the men's super-G, which had originally been
scheduled for that date. In addition, the first training run for
the women's downhill was lost, reducing the number of training runs
to one, Friday.
With the slalom events dominating the second week, and many of
the skiers harboring medal hopes in those disciplines as well as
the speed events, the window on some semblance of an orderly and
even complete Alpine Olympics is closing. The forecast was calling
for clear and sunny conditions on Friday, the new date for the
men's downhill and men's combined downhill.
Monday was the only off day between Thursday and the last day of
the Games, Feb. 22. Other possible dates for maneuverability are
Sunday and next Tuesday, both days originally set aside for the
women's combined, which is not a high priority event.
With each postponement, the men's downhill favorites grow more
frustrated, particularly the Austrians, who dominated the three
training runs last week and believed they were peaking in time for
the race.
``Now, who knows?'' Hermann Maier said after a fourth training
run was added Wednesday. Norway's Kjetil Andre Aamodt posted the
fastest time.
Also, the draw has to be recast for each new date. For
Thursday's run, the Americans A.J. Kitt and Tommy Moe had drawn the
16th and 17th positions in a field of 43. That left them just
outside the top 15, but not far enough down the list so that the
course would be chewed up by the time they were on it. Moe, the
defending gold medalist, has not had a top 15 finish in the
downhill this season, was said to be upset.
This is hardly the first time weather has plagued the Alpine
events. In Sarajevo in 1984, Bill Johnson of the United States won
the downhill on the 14th day of competition. But the snow that can
quickly change to rain and turn the course into a slushy mess had
ski veterans shaking their heads Thursday, and at least one Salt
Lake City official promising this would not be the case in 2002.
At this rate, they may run the 2002 men's downhill before
1998's.
