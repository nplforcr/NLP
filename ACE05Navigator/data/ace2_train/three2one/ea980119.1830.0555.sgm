 This is the first day that drivers can have switches installed to turn off the air bags in their cars. The option is being made available after some children were killed by air bags, and some adults feared the air bags would do more harm than good to them. Here's ABC's Lisa Stark.

 Sixty-three hundred people have applied for the cutoff switches and more than five thousand of them, including Alice Featherstone, have already been approved. Surprisingly, more than half of the requests are for switches to disable driver's side air bags. From people like Featherstone, worried about sitting too close to the steering wheel.

 If that thing comes out at two hundred miles an hour and my face is right here, um it's going to snap my neck, I think, like a twig.

 Only twenty-four percent of the approvals are for just passenger side switches, primarily in cases where kids must ride up front.

 But many dealers and mechanics are refusing to install the switches, worried about getting sued if someone turns off an air bag and then is injured or killed in an accident.

 This is a situation where the customer controls our liability with the flip of a switch, and we're not willing to take that risk.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Lisa_Stark" spkrtype="female" startTime="630.035" endTime="643.219">
 So far, only Ford and General Motors have switches ready. Installing them will cost two to three hundred dollars each. But drivers will have to search for someone to do it. Lisa Stark, ABC News, Washington.
