PRACHAKORN Thai Party leader Samak Sundaravej yesterday
staunchly defended the record of the Chavalit Yongchaiyudh
administration as clean because it reflected ''human'', not
''buffalo'' efforts.
Adding colour to the two-day debate on the four financial
decrees, Samak took the floor to rebut Democrat MP and
Communications Minister Suthep Thaugsuban who accused the Chavalit
government of economic mismanagement which prompted the issuing of
decrees to clean up its mess.
The Prachakorn Thai leader, who was a partner in the
Chavalit-led coalition, angrily responded that the government was
trying to pass the blame for economic malaise to the previous
administration.
This government has tried to open old wounds although Chavalit
already declared his readiness to take responsibility for his
government's record, he said.
He reiterated his stand that the root cause of the ailing
economy was currency speculator George Soros who carried out the
attack on the baht in collusion with the International Monetary
Fund.
In previous public statements, he accused Soros of gaining
insider information on the state of Thai economy from the IMF.
The outspoken party leader concluded his rebuttal by driving a
wedge between Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai and Finance Minister
Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda, saying that Chuan had no control over
Tarrin and that the finance minister would soon rally support from
the banking sector to usurp Chuan's power.
