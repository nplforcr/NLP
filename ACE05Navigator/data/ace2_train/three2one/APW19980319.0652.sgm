MADRID, Spain (AP) _ With just 10 rounds remaining, FC Barcelona
lies a comfortable seven points ahead of nearest challenger Real
Madrid as it takes on an Athletic Bilbao gunning for a UEFA cup
berth.
Barcelona goes into the 30th-round game Sunday still buoyant
after its 3-0 victory over Real Madrid two weeks ago which it
followed up with by winning the European Supercup in a victory over
European Champions Cup semifinalist Borussia Dortmund.
Louis Van Gaal's crew then stretched its lead over eternal rival
Madrid to seven points last round when it narrowly defeated
weakling side Compostela 2-1.
Its opponent Sunday, Bilbao, downed Mallorca 3-1 last round to
edge up to sixth place in the 20-team division, with 47 points, 11
less than Barcelona.
``We'll go to Barcelona with no hang-ups,'' said Bilbao defender
Aitor Larazabal. ``We already know what it's like to beat them and
now we must try to win every game so as not to lose out in UEFA.''
Barcelona will be without Spanish international right back
Albert Ferrer because of supsension.
Meanwhile, Madrid takes on Barcelona's last victim, Compostela,
in its 30th-round game also Sunday. The side is certain to be
overflowing with confidence in the aftermath of the 3-0 drubbing of
Bayer Leverkusen Wednesday that advanced it into the semifinals of
the European Champions Cup.
``It was the Madrid that all of us wanted to see,'' said
chairman Lorenzo Sanz.
The result came as a welcome breather for German coach Juup
Heynckes whose future at the club had been questioned following
dismal domestic league performances, and particularly after the
humiliating defeat by Barcelona.
A defeat for Madrid on Sunday, however, would be fatal for the
side's already slim chances of catching the leader and could lead
to renewed pressure on Heynckes.
New surprise team Celta, third with 48 points, travels to
Mallorca hoping to extend its seven-match unbeaten streak.
Real Sociedad and Betis, both with 47 points, face each other in
a battle for fourth place with both teams determined to keep their
UEFA Cup hopes alive.
In the league's only game Saturday, Atletico Madrid, triumphant
after its UEFA quarterfinal victory midweek, travels to lowly
Salamanca.
Other 30th-round games Sunday are: Valencia vs. Espanyol;
Deportivo de La Coruna vs. Zaragoza; Sporting de Gijon vs. Merida;
Tenerife vs Oviedo; and Racing de Santander vs.Valladolid.
No game is scheduled for Monday.
