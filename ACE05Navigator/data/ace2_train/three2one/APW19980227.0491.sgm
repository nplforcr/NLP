Israeli prime minister to visit Norway, discuss peace process

OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is
to discuss the deadlocked Middle East peace process in a three-day
visit to Norway next week, officials said Friday.
The prospects for resuscitating the peace process have appeared
grim lately, but any visits by Middle East officials to the country
that guided the 1993 peace agreement raise speculation that a
breakthrough may be in the works.
``Norway has a central role in the peace process, and we
obviously will do what we can to contribute to the process going
further,'' Norwegian Foreign Ministry spokesman Ingvard Havnen told
the Norwegian news agency NTB.
Netanyahu's visit is to run March 6-8, when he will meet both
with Prime Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik and with Foreign Minister
Knut Vollebaek, Israeli Embassy second secretary Johnathan Meidan
told The Associated Press.
Although the secret ``Oslo Channel'' talks that brought about
the Israel-PLO peace agreement were conducted under the former
Social Democrat-led government, the new government that took power
in October is deeply interested in continuing its Middle East
influence.
Both Vollebaek and Bondevik have visited Israel since the
government took power, and Terje Roed-Larsen, a key figure in the
1993 process, was appointed last month as the new government's
special envoy for the Middle East.
A senior U.S. diplomat assured Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
on Thursday that Washington was resuming efforts to break the
Mideast deadlock, Palestinian officials said.
The United States has asked Israel and the Palestinians to
respond to a proposal that Israel withdraw from 13.1 percent of the
West Bank over 12 weeks. The withdrawal would take place in three
small stages, and each stage would be accompanied by Palestinian
security gestures.
