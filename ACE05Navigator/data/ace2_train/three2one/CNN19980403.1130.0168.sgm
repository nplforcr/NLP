 Independent counsel Kenneth Starr may be considering a new strategy in his
 investigation of President Clinton.
 Bob Franken has the story.

<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="178.044" endTime="188.483">
 With the Paula Jones case set aside, at least for now, independent counsel
 Ken Starr is deciding exactly how he will pursue the allegations against
 the president and his associates.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="188.483" endTime="197.281">
 The crimes that we have been charged with, uh, investigating are subordination of
 perjury, intimidation of witnesses and obstruction of justice.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="197.281" endTime="250.153">
 Sources tell CNN, Starr's office is discussing a tough new approach.
 Some of his more aggressive prosecutors are recommending he indict Monica
 Lewinsky and name President Clinton an unindicted co-conspirator in an
 alleged cover-up.
 While the conventional wisdom has been that Starr would turn over his
 findings to congress, the new scenario would give him a better opportunity,
 advocates argue, to publicly air evidence against the president.
 Lewinsky would be charged with perjury and subordinating perjury for trying to
 get Linda Tripp to lie under oath during her deposition with Paula Jones'
 attorneys.
 One hitch, sources say, is the fight with Lewinsky's lawyer over his claim
 she has already been offered a binding immunity deal which would preclude
 this scenario.
 That fight is awaiting a ruling by the presiding judge.
 Starr continued to push his investigation calling White House chief of
 staff Erskine Bowles before the grand jury.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="250.153" endTime="254.273">
 The real question that we're examining is, wh- were crimes committed?
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="254.273" endTime="262.047">
 But some lawyers challenge whether Starr still has grounds to continue this
 probe because of the Jones ruling.
 Among them, a former independent counsel.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="262.047" endTime="274.122">
 Under the federal statutes, even though a person lies under oath or gets
 somebody else to lie under oath, unless it's material, unless it hurts
 someone, it's not, not prosecutable.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="274.122" endTime="298.51">
 There are also still several important witnesses yet to appear before the
 grand jury, including Linda Tripp, and Lewinsky, depending on the immunity
 fight.
 And there's Kathleen Willey.
 CNN has learned that she was scheduled to give another deposition in her
 home town of Richmond to Paula Jones' attorneys this Saturday over the
 objections of Starr.
 That problem has gone away.
