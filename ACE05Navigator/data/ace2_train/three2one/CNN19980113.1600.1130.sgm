 A new report reveals more problems at the Internal Revenue Service.
 A broad review of the agency found it used improper tactics in evaluating IRS employees at many IRS offices across the
 country.
 They were in fact graded on how aggressively they collected money from some taxpayers.
 Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said relying on such measures puts taxpayers rights in
 jeopardy across the country and doesn't focus on improving the quality of services.
 This follows a senate hearing in September, where the IRS was accused of being
 abusive and using its powers in an arbitrary manner.
