NEW YORK _ The New Jersey Nets' Jayson Williams walked through
Penn Station on Friday afternoon as though he owned the place,
signing autographs and kissing tourists. But after an hour of
signing copies of his Details magazine column, he felt as haggard
as a commuter on his way home.
While the Bulls' Michael Jordan and the Lakers' Shaquille O'Neal
each anted up the $10,000 fine imposed by the National Basketball
Association for skipping the news media interview session on
All-Star weekend, Williams was only too happy to endure the crowds.
``I see why those guys take the fine, why Charles Barkley takes
the fine every year,'' Williams said. ``I can understand it.
They're not from this town. But I've got to live here the rest of
my life, plus I'm more of a people person than all those guys put
together. Those guys don't like being around people. I like talking
to people, getting their opinions.''
Williams' day began just after sunrise, when he conducted radio
interviews from his home. By the time he arrived at the New York
Hilton to be interrogated by the news media at 4 p.m., he was
dragging. He had been to Mountainside Children's Hospital for a
video teleconference, he had appearances scheduled with four
television stations and a rehearsal for the Team Up Celebration,
and was finally heading to MTV's studios to co-host a live show.
Everybody's Keeping Busy
While Jayson Williams may be the only New Yorker in Sunday's
All-Star game, he's not alone in running ragged through the city
this weekend. The Knicks' Patrick Ewing, with his good arm, rang
the bell to start trading at the New York Stock Exchange.
The Knicks' Charles Oakley, may almost be as busy as Williams,
even though his only official task is competing in the shoot-around
competition tonight. Oakley was also hosting a comedy show last
night, coaching the celebrity all-star game at the Jacob Javits
Center and modeling in a charity fashion show.
The Next Jordan? Not Yet
With Michael Jordan a no-show Friday, the Lakers' Kobe Bryant
was inundated with questions concerning his status as the heir
apparent to Jordan. But Bryant dismissed the talk for now.
``Michael, Larry Bird and Magic Johnson set such high
standards,'' Bryant said. ``Now they're talking about the young
players carrying the league. We're young and we're just enjoying
life. We're still learning.''
Glad (and Mad) to Be Here
The Pacers' Reggie Miller was happy to be in New York, the site
of many of his proudest moments, even calling it ``the second
basketball place,'' behind Indiana. Asked if he expected to conduct
his usual repartee with the film director Spike Lee, he said,
``David Stern went up on the ticket prices. Spike isn't going to be
sitting in the first row.''
The Lakers' Nick Van Exel was not thrilled to be in New York, at
least after he was the first robbery victim among the players. ``I
was real excited to get here until someone stole my bag,'' Van Exel
said. ``It was my carry-on. It had all my CDs in it.''
