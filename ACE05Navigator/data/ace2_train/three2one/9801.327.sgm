The nation's census director, after fighting with Congress for two years over 
how to conduct the next population count, announced yesterday she is quitting, 
leaving unfilled a critical leadership position as the nation heads into the 
2000 census. 

Martha Farnsworth Riche said that the dispute with Republican congressional 
leaders did not directly lead to her resignation, but several people who know 
her well said she was frustrated by the political battle and the prospect that 
it would continue for another two years. 

"This is going to be a brutal fight," said Rep. Thomas C. Sawyer (D-Ohio), who 
has been closely involved in the census and is among those who believes the 
ongoing debate played a role in Riche's departure. Replacing Riche will be, by 
all accounts, enormously difficult, given the disagreement over the census that 
divides the Clinton administration and the Republican leadership in Congress, 
whose approval is necessary for Senate confirmation. 

The dispute centers on a technical question with broad political repercussions: 
Republican leaders, particularly in the House, are adamantly opposed to the 
administration's plan to combine head counts with statistical estimates to 
arrive at a national population count. 

Riche, backed by a National Academy of Sciences panel, has argued steadfastly 
that in order to improve its accuracy, the census should rely more than ever 
before on sampling, which gathers information from a random selection of 
households and then uses that to extrapolate characteristics for a larger group. 
The idea is to get a better gauge for accounting for millions of Americans, 
predominantly poor and minorities, who have been missed when the government has 
relied almost exclusively on a door-to-door head count. 

Sampling, because it would increase the numbers of minorities counted in the 
census, is generally considered likely to benefit Democrats more than 
Republicans. 

With that issue unresolved, the bureau is heading into the final planning stages 
for the 2000 census, a $ 4 billion effort that will employ 300,000 people. 

Rep. Dan Miller (R-Fla.), who heads the House subcommittee that oversees the 
census, said he was startled by Riche's departure. 

"I have expressed my concern that we are rapidly headed toward a failed census 
in 2000," he said in a statement. "Riche's sudden departure adds to my anxiety. 
. . ." 

Riche said yesterday she was leaving to pursue other interests, including 
writing and teaching, and an administration source said she had been offered a 
lecturing position at Princeton University. 

"I have done what I came to do," she said, citing improved methods of collecting 
and managing the nation's statistical system. She said she had not made a 
commitment to the administration to stay through the 2000 census. 

Riche has in the past expressed her frustration that the controversy over 
sampling had forced her to focus most of her attention and energy on the 2000 
head count, while the agency is also responsible for numerous other projects. 

"I want a life," she said. "This is a tough job. I can't tell you how many 
people say, 'That's a thankless job.' Why would somebody want to stay in a 
thankless job when they've done what they wanted to do?" 

Riche, 58, an economist who helped found American Demographics magazine, took 
office in 1994, the day before the electoral victory that gave the Republican 
Party control of Congress. 

Others say Riche was in an nearly impossible role. 

"The difficulty in that position is being stuck between the scholarly community, 
advising her how to take a good census, and the political community, reacting to 
political forces," said William O'Hare, a demographer with the Annie E. Casey 
Foundation. 

A Commerce Department spokesman said the administration would begin the process 
of appointing an acting director soon and then search for a permanent 
replacement. 

However, several congressional sources expressed concern that replacing Riche 
with someone who meets Republican approval could be difficult, because any 
nominee's position on sampling could emerge as a litmus test. It is unlikely the 
White House would nominate a successor who did not support sampling, and equally 
unlikely Republican leaders would look favorably on such a candidate. 

That raises the prospect that the position could go unfilled for a long period, 
even as the Census Bureau conducts its rehearsal of the census this spring and 
begins final preparations for the 2000 count. 

According to the administration's plan, census employees would attempt to 
collect a questionnaire from every household, but then contact a statistically 
representative sample of people who failed to respond. The results of that 
sample would be used to arrive at a total population figure and the race, income 
and other characteristics of those who could not be counted directly. 

Republicans, particularly those in the House, have maintained that such a 
process is subject to manipulation, less accurate than a traditional head count 
and unconstitutional. In the appropriations bill approved late last year, 
Congress allowed the bureau to test sampling this spring, but vowed to renew the 
fight before the 2000 census.
