Ann Eppard, who became an influential transportation lobbyist through her
close alliance with House Transportation Chairman Bud Shuster (R-Pa.), was
indicted by a federal grand jury yesterday for allegedly taking $ 230,000
in illegal payments to influence a massive Boston highway project while
serving as Shuster's top aide.

Eppard, 55, also was charged with embezzling $ 27,500 from Shuster's
campaign committee -- she served as its assistant treasurer -- by allegedly
arranging phony payments for a consultant who then returned the money to
her through a relative.

Since the Republican takeover of Congress in 1994, Shuster has become one
of the most powerful House committee chairmen, overseeing the $ 217 billion
highway bill. But at the same time, Shuster has been under investigation by
the grand jury that indicted Eppard yesterday. He has also been the subject
of a separate House Ethics Committee investigation of his dealings with
Eppard after she became a lobbyist.

U.S. Attorney Donald Stern in Boston said in a statement that no one else
in Shuster's office participated in the seven-count indictment's list of
crimes, which occurred before Eppard left Shuster's staff after the 1994
election, but he added that the investigation is continuing.

In a statement yesterday, Shuster called Eppard "one of the finest, most
decent and dedicated persons I have ever known," predicted she will be
"totally vindicated" and termed the accusations "a political indictment,
pure and simple."

Eppard's lawyer, Richard M. Egbert, said she "vehemently denies these
allegations" and the grand jury probe "smacks of political motivation."

Eppard, who opened her own lobbying firm after the 1994 GOP victory that
propelled Shuster to the chairmanship, has carved out a lucrative specialty
as a transportation lobbyist representing clients before her former boss.
She also has continued to serve as a $ 3,000-a-month consultant for
Shuster's campaign and tapped her lobbying clients to contribute to him.
Her lobbying firm, Ann Eppard Associates Ltd., reported billings of more
than $ 1 million in 1996, the most recent year for which figures are
available.

The indictment names both Eppard and Washington lobbyist, Vernon A. Clark,
68, charging them with conspiracy, mail fraud and wire fraud for a scheme
allegedly dating back to 1989, when Eppard was Shuster's chief of staff.

It alleges that Eppard received illegal gratuities from Clark and two
Boston businessmen seeking her help in fighting plans to take their land
for a multibillion-dollar underground highway project known as the Big Dig.
Some of the gratuities were in the form of loans and disguised by being
funneled to a relative of Eppard's, the indictment alleges. Although not
named in the indictment, the relative is Eppard's son Ralph, who operates a
Chrysler dealership on Maryland's Eastern Shore.

Sources familiar with the probe have said Stern's office is investigating
Shuster and has been trying to get Clark to provide evidence against the
congressman and Eppard. Clark, who first met Shuster and Eppard years ago
while lobbying for the billboard industry, was indicted in Boston on
unrelated conspiracy and tax fraud charges last month. His attorney,
Brendan Sullivan, declined to comment yesterday.

In his statement, Stern said the alleged gratuities were not disclosed by
Eppard, "often were disguised with phony documents, and represented a
breach of public trust."

In a series of interviews for a Washington Post Magazine story published
Sunday, Eppard portrayed herself as a woman without financial means beyond
her congressional salary, which ranged from $ 67,000 to $ 110,000 in her
last decade on the Hill. She said she borrowed heavily from her government
retirement fund to pay for her son's education. In 1995, she told a
reporter, "I'm a woman with five Visa cards."

In December 1994, she bought a waterfront town house in Alexandria for $
823,000 after signing up a handful of well-paying clients. Early last year,
she traded up to a $ 1.4 million town house in the same complex. By last
year, her small lobbying shop was billing clients at the rate of $ 1.4
million a year.

The 31-page indictment outlined an alleged scheme that began in 1989 when
Richard Goldberg, part-owner of a parking lot near Logan International
Airport, and another businessman hired Clark to help them fight plans to
take their land for the Big Dig. News accounts in Boston have identified
Nicholas Contos, owner of a restaurant, as a cooperating witness in the
inquiry who acknowledged making a loan to Ralph Eppard's auto dealership.

According to the indictment, Goldberg paid $ 10,000 in consulting fees to
Eppard's relative in 1990, and Clark paid the relative $ 15,000 in 1989 and
1991. In 1991, Goldberg and Contos reached separate deals on the land
disputes. After that, Clark made $ 130,000 in favorable loans to Eppard's
relative. The other businessman made an Eppard-solicited $ 75,000 loan to
the relative in early 1992. That was about the time Ralph Eppard opened his
car dealership.

Eppard used her relative as a "straw" on one $ 30,000 loan from Clark she
needed to finance the purchase of a town house in Alexandria in 1993, the
indictment charges. Though the relative received much of the money, Eppard
herself benefited because her son's dealership paid her $ 10,300 in the
spring of 1993 and $ 100,000 from November 1994 to February 1995, and gave
her free use of a car.

The indictment also listed several "official acts" it said Eppard took on
behalf of Clark and his clients from 1989 to 1994, when she left Shuster's
staff. In late 1993, for example, it said Eppard spoke with a Conrail
employee on behalf of Clark's unnamed client, Contos, about altering its
1991 land agreement with the restaurant owner.

Shuster and Eppard met in Washington in 1969 when Shuster, a computer
business executive, hired Eppard as his executive assistant. Eppard
followed Shuster into congressional politics in the early 1970s and emerged
as a political force in Washington and Pennsylvania as his chief of staff,
chief fund-raiser and political alter ego. Although Shuster rarely
attracted an opponent, he and Eppard raised and spent millions on
activities that were tangentially related to campaigning, according to
reviews of Federal Election Commission records.
