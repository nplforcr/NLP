JERUSALEM (AP) _ Two Islamic militants suspected of killing an
Israeli soldier and plotting a Tel Aviv bombing went on trial
Sunday, and a Palestinian charged with helping finance Hamas
activists was brought before judges.
Jamal al-Hor and Abdel Rahman Ghanimat are charged in an Israeli
military court in Lod of running a Hamas squad that is blamed for
the deaths of 11 Israelis over the past two years.
Hor and Ghanimat allegedly ran the Islamic militant Hamas
group's cell in the West Bank village of Tsurif, north of Hebron.
The cell has been blamed for three drive-by shootings, the
abduction and slaying of an Israeli soldier, and a March suicide
bombing in a Tel Aviv cafe that killed three women.
Also Sunday, the court was to extend the detention of Mohammed
Othman, a 25-year-old from the Shuafat refugee camp in Jerusalem
accused of running the banned Holy Land Foundation.
Israel outlawed the Richardson, Texas-based Holy Land Foundation
last year, saying it transfers funds to Hamas activists and gives
money to the families of suicide bombers.
According to the charge sheet against Othman, also known as
Rahman Anati, the group transferred funds through him to Hamas
activists in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza.
