SEOUL, Jan. 21-
 


One of the richest men in South Korea, the chairman of Samsung Co., said today 
he would sell $ 75 million worth of landholdings -- keeping only his and his 
mother's homes -- to invest in his ailing company and "share the pain of the 
nation." 

Samsung Chairman Lee Kun Hee, a man considered almost royalty here, also pledged 
to donate 90 percent of his annual income, or about $ 6 million, to a welfare 
fund for workers as long as the country remains crippled by financial crisis. 

This dramatic and symbolic announcement came as the president-elect, Kim Dae 
Jung, vowed to cut his own modest salary by 30 percent. (At the current exchange 
rate, his presidential salary would amount to less than $ 60,000.) 

Samsung also announced today that the company is scaling back, shelving plans to 
build a showcase 102-story Seoul office building and cutting ties with a prized 
asset, the influential daily newspaper Joong Ang Ilbo. Samsung also plans to 
sell $ 300 million worth of buildings in London, Singapore and the New York 
area. 

But, in a sign of the growing suffering of ordinary workers, chairman Lee's plan 
to donate personal assets to help with the problems was quickly dismissed by 
angry working people and by political analysts as a pittance. 

"These company heads exploited their workers and got rich off the little 
people," said Lee Hi Ho, a businessman hit by the crisis. "It's their duty to 
give back some of the money." 

"I am really not impressed. The money didn't belong to him in the first place," 
said an even angrier Han Jae Jyuk, 32, a worker in Seoul. 

But despite criticisms that the corporate elite must do more, Lee's offering 
adds to the growing pressure on the men who run South Korea's biggest companies 
to forfeit some of their enormous wealth. For some of the corporate kings, 
personal helicopters and antique cars are as common as toys. 

"There is strong and growing resentment toward the chaebol heads," said Lee Jung 
Hoon, a political science professor at Yonsei University, referring to the 
leaders of the country's business conglomerates. "People want the industrial 
heads to demonstrate their share of the suffering." 

Lee said some of these titans have amassed so much money that many feel that 
these family-run companies, along with the government, orchestrated 
"institutionalized theft of taxpayers." He said he doubted today's announcements 
would satisfy people who have been hit hard by shrinking income and rising 
prices. 

"So he gives up 90 percent of his salary. These guys don't need a salary," 
Professor Lee said. 

A growing number of ordinary people, faced with unpaid bills or their small 
businesses going bust, are trying to sell their homes to raise cash. Some, at 
least, were glad the chairman of Samsung was putting up some of his property, 
too. 

"I know it is only a symbolic gesture, but it means a lot," said housewife Kim 
Sun Yong. 

Chairman Lee apparently could recoup the money he invested in Samsung from the 
sale of his real estate, but the details of his pledge were not clear tonight. A 
spokesman for the company, Je Seung Lim, said the chairman also would withdraw 
cash from his bank account and sell stock for a new fund for workers hurt by the 
restructuring efforts. He said the chairman was trying to help the nation "pull 
through the current economic hardship." 

Mass layoffs are expected throughout South Korea in coming months, and millions 
of workers have been notified in recent weeks about sharp pay cuts. The most 
militant unions are asking that the heads of the conglomerates be removed from 
their businesses and replaced by professional managers, because millions of 
livelihoods are at stake. 

The chairman of the Lotte Group, Shin Kyuk Ho, said last week that he would 
invest $ 10 million of his own money to bolster his company, and announcements 
from other chairmen are now expected. 

President-elect Kim made it clear Tuesday that he was not pleased with the 
restructuring plans announced by two other conglomerates, Hyundai Corp. and LG 
Group; the wealthy heads of these conglomerates did not offer to use their 
personal assets in the recovery plan. The president-elect was quoted by aides as 
calling their plans "hollow" and "cosmetic."
