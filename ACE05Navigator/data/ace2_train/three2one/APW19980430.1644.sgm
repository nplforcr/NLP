BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's Criminal Court has fined a
law tutor who threw a bag of human excrement at the minister of
commerce in 1994, The Bangkok Post reported Friday.
Judge Somchai Panthmnopas imposed a 6,000-baht (dlrs 155) fine
and a suspended one-year jail term on Thanit Suwanmena on Thursday,
the paper said.
Thanit hurled the bag of excrement at Commerce Minister Uthai
Pimchaichon during a press conference in 1994. It exploded on
impact when it hit Uthai's face.
The tutor said he was angry that Uthai had reinstated a Commerce
Ministry official accused of corruption.
Uthai was one of the chief drafters of Thailand's new
constitution, which is designed to reduce corruption and increase
civil rights.
