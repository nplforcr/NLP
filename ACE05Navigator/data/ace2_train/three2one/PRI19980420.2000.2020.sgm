 This is The World, a co-production of the BBC world service, PRI and WGBH
 in Boston.
 I'm Lisa Mullins.
 In Mexico today, the government is closing the net on foreign
 nationals in Chiapas.
 It set up more military checkpoints in the southern state in an attempt
 to round up foreigners suspected of supporting the Zapatista rebels.
 Last week, the government expelled fifteen foreign nationals
 from Chiapas, accusing them of violating the Mexican constitution by
 engaging in political activity.
 The World's Alejandra Martins is now in San Cristobal
 De Las Casas in the heart of Chiapas.
 Alejandra, why is the Mexican government focusing on foreigners in
 Chiapas and trying to expel them?
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="2058.819" endTime="2102.601">
 The government is saying very clearly that, uh, it's not xenophobic at all, that
 they are expelling the foreigners because they are violating the Mexican
 constitution by supporting the pro Zapatista communities.
 But, uh, they might have been, eh, to some foreigners who might have been engaging
 in some sort of illegal activities.
 But, uh, the truth is for the vast majority of the foreigners who I've seen in
 these communities are not engaging in any kind of activities at all.
 They are there just as observers.
 And the interesting thing is that the leaders of the pro Zapatista
 communities that I've talked to want them to be there, because they feel afraid
 that at some point, uh, the army might enter the communities, and they feel
 afraid of the paramilitaries as well.
 And they feel that by having foreigners there, it's a kind of, it's a guarantee.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="2102.601" endTime="2116.761">
 So you're saying that they look on the foreigners as a kind of protection, and
 in the event th- that more and more foreigners are expelled, is it seen as the
 government's aim to try and intensify the campaign against the Zapatistas, uh,
 with the, with the, ultimate goal of destroying the group?
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="2116.761" endTime="2141.380">
 This is certainly the feeling among some of the leaders of this pro Zapatista
 communities.
 It is difficult, really, to know at this point what the strategy
 uh- of the government is.
 Uh, the President, President Zedillo, is saying that, uh, the government
 wants to negotiate, that they don't want a military solution to
 the conflict.
 But, on the other hand, it's difficult to see how negotiation can
 take place, because there is a complete lack of trust, uh, between both parts.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="2141.380" endTime="2153.637">
 Who are the foreigners who you're talking about there?
 I know that you said many are tourists and, and, uh, observers.
 The ones who seem to be supporting the Zapatistas, uh, who exactly are they?
 And are they primarily Americans?
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="2153.637" endTime="2201.197">
 Not necessarily.
 I went to one of the communities, one of these pro Zapatista, uh,
 communities, uh, where they have, uh- autonomous municipality that they've
 established, the ones that the government says are completely illegal.
 And I found there French, uh, nationals.
 I found there Italians.
 I found there lots of people from Spain.
 I didn't find anybody from the US, but I did find people from
 the US here in San Cristobal who were ready to travel to some of the
 communities.
 And, uh, the motivations are very, very, uh, different.
 In some cases, you have idealistic Europeans or Americans who want to come
 and, and learn, uh, from the communities how to live in a community,
 how to take decisions among the community.
 Other people are just concerned about the situation in Chiapas.
 Uh, they get all sorts of information in their countries, and they want to come
 and see what's going on.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="2201.197" endTime="2207.976">
 So is it your sense, Alejandra that the kind of crackdown that we've been
 seeing on, on foreign nationals in Chiapas that that sort of thing might
 continue?
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="2207.976" endTime="2241.082">
 I think so.
 Uh, when I was traveling to one of these, uh, pro Zapatista communities, I
 was traveling in a van, and there was a French woman in the van.
 We were stopped at a military checkpoint.
 We stayed there for an hour.
 And uh even though she was not doing anything at all, uh, she was traveling on a
 tourist visa, but just the fact that she was entering a highly
 sensitive area was enough for the authorities to confiscate her tourist
 visa and ask her to report, uh, to the authorities within forty-eight hours.
 She has to report today, so we'll see what happens.
 But this indicates it's just, uh, entering this area is enough for the
 authorities to raise suspicion.

 The World's Alejandra Martins speaking to us from San Cristobal De Las
 Casas in Chiapas, Mexico.
 Thank you, Alejandra.
