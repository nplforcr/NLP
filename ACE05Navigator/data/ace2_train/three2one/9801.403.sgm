Former housing secretary Henry Cisneros pleaded not guilty yesterday to felony 
charges that he lied to the FBI about paying $ 250,000 in hush money to a former 
mistress. 

He is charged with a multifaceted conspiracy in which he allegedly worked 
frantically before, during and after his confirmation as housing secretary to 
keep his ex-mistress from disclosing their long relationship and the extent of 
payments he made to her to keep their relationship quiet. The grand jury said 
that Cisneros also made payments to a second woman whom the ex-mistress, Linda 
Medlar, knew about, and that Medlar was being paid to keep that quiet as well. 

Initially, it appeared that Cisneros and Medlar, who also is charged in the 
case, would not appear together in the courtroom. At the start of the 
arraignment, U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin announced that Medlar would not 
make her appearance until later in the day. 

But just after Cisneros and two other defendants had settled into their seats at 
the defense table, the courtroom door burst open. Attorney Roger Adelman, a 
burly former federal prosecutor, stormed into the well of the court with Medlar 
trailing behind him. 

Adelman launched rapid-fire into the arraignment routine, leaving Sporkin's 
clerk somewhat speechless. He quickly waived formal reading of the 66-page 
indictment and announced that his client was pleading not guilty to all charges. 


"You are always ahead of the game, Mr. Adelman," Sporkin said, chuckling. 

When Medlar joined the other defendants yesterday at the defense table, Cisneros 
looked directly at her, and they appeared to acknowledge each other. But she did 
not hold his gaze and sat at the far end of the table, leaning away from the 
others. 

Their trial was set for Nov. 4. 

Cisneros, 43, a former mayor of San Antonio, headed the Department of Housing 
and Urban Development from 1993 through 1996 and once was considered a rising 
star in national politics. He was indicted last month on charges of conspiracy, 
obstruction of justice and making false statements. 

Outside the courthouse, Cisneros spoke out for the first time since he was 
indicted, addressing reporters in English and Spanish: "I regret the pain that 
this matter has caused my wife, my children, my parents and my family. They are 
wonderful, good, loving people. 

"I care deeply about my community, and I love our country, which I've tried to 
serve in a number of different capacities. I came to Washington to try to do 
good, and I'm proud of the good we were able to do," said Cisneros, accompanied 
by his attorney, Brendan V. Sullivan Jr. "I have deep faith and trust in 
America's institutions and particularly believe in the inherent fairness of our 
judicial system." 

Cisneros now lives in Los Angeles, where he is president of Univision, a 
Spanish-language television network. 

Medlar, 45, of Lubbock, Tex., is also charged with conspiracy and making a false 
statement. She goes on trial Jan. 15 in Lubbock in a related case for conspiracy 
to commit bank fraud in connection with a house purchased in the names of her 
relatives with money she allegedly received from Cisneros. 

In the Lubbock case, her attorney, a public defender, has filed motions to 
suppress statements she made to independent counsel David M. Barrett's 
assistants. Her Lubbock lawyer alleges that Medlar was having serious emotional 
problems, and that prosecutors knew it. 

Barrett's office initially entered into a cooperation agreement with her in 
November 1995. But prosecutors became suspicious of her. In the Washington case, 
she is charged with lying to the FBI when she said she had given original tapes 
to the Internal Revenue Service of conversations with Cisneros she had secretly 
recorded. 

Because Medlar says she cannot afford to pay for an attorney, taxpayers will be 
paying legal fees for Adelman, who is court-appointed. 

The two other defendants in the Washington case are former Cisneros aides Sylvia 
Arce-Garcia, 43, of Los Angeles, and John D. Rosales, 41, of the Washington 
area. Arce-Garcia is charged with conspiracy. Rosales is charged with conspiracy 
and two counts of making false statements.
