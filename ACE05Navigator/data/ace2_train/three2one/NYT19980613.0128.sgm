NEW YORK _ Eighteen years ago, Wojciech Kozak helped build Trump
Tower, the skyscraper jewel in Donald Trump's real-estate empire.
Today, Kozak recalls that time with nightmare memories of
backbreaking 12-hour shifts and of being cheated with 200 other
undocumented Polish immigrants out of meager wages and fringe
benefits.
``We worked in horrid, terrible conditions,'' Kozak said of the
six months he spent in 1980 wielding a sledgehammer and a blowtorch
in demolishing the Bonwit Teller Building on Fifth Avenue to make
way for Trump Tower. ``We were frightened illegal immigrants and
did not know enough about our rights.''
Kozak, like other laborers on that job, has no hope of
collecting about $4,000 in back wages from a contracting company
that began the demolition and later became insolvent. But after
almost two decades, the demolition workers are still struggling to
compel Trump and his business associates to compensate a union's
welfare funds and thus increase pension and medical benefits for
some of the Polish workers.
Kozak is now a party and witness in a class-action lawsuit that
has meandered through the federal courts for 15 years and charges
that Trump owes $4 million to the union welfare funds for the work
the Poles performed. Filed in 1983, the suit has been bogged down
by a torrent of motions and appeals of judicial decisions and by
the deaths of a judge, a lawyer, the original lead plaintiffs, an
important witness and two of Trump's co-defendants.
In an effort to resolve the tangled case _ one of the oldest on
the civil dockets of the U.S. District Court in Manhattan _ Judge
Kevin Duffy last month warned lawyers for both sides to be prepared
to begin a jury trial on 48 hours' notice.
But last Thursday, in a development that could delay the trial
yet again, Duffy ordered the case assigned to another judge.
Lawyers for both sides said the 48-hour notice was still in effect,
but that it was unclear when the trial would start.
Trump denies that he was aware of the working conditions at the
site in 1980 or that any of the demolition workers were
undocumented immigrants. He is also challenging claims that he is
liable for payments to the union that were evaded by the demolition
contractor.
``All we did was to try to keep a job going that was started by
someone else,'' Trump, in an interview, said of his company's
efforts to guarantee that the demolition contractor paid wages to
employees. ``In fact, we helped people and it has cost a lot of
money in legal fees.''
Kozak and other Polish immigrants who were hired for the
demolition said in interviews that they often worked in choking
clouds of asbestos dust without protective equipment like safety
masks, metal helmets and gloves. They accepted the conditions
because they thought the job would pay 10 times as much as they
could earn in Poland, said Kozak, 56, a slightly built man who
became an American citizen and joined a laborers' union.
Julian Nalepa, 63, who suffered a head injury in the demolition,
said he and fellow workers were baffled by the unending suit. ``It
makes you think that only the rich have rights in the courts,'' he
said.
The demolition project on Fifth Avenue and 56th Street lasted
from January to June 1980. It cleared the way for an ornate
68-story glass-sheathed structure containing shops and an atrium on
the lower floors and 263 condominium apartments above that
originally sold for $500,000 to $10 million each.
The tower was financed and built by Trump's development company,
Trump Organization, and Equitable Life Assurance Society of the
United States.
According to court records and testimony, the Trump-Equitable
joint venture hired Kaszycki and Sons Contractors Inc. at a fee of
$775,000 to raze Bonwit Teller's 10-story flagship department store
although the contractor had little demolition experience.
Demolition Workers Local 95 of the Laborers' International Union of
North America had a collective bargaining agreement with the
Kaszycki company, of Herkimer, N.Y., requiring it to pay specified
wages to union and nonunion workers at the Trump Tower site and to
make additional payments for each worker into the local's pension
and medical insurance funds.
Wendy Sloan and Lewis Steel, lawyers for current and retired
Local 95 members in the suit, assert that William Kaszycki, owner
of the contracting company, hired about 200 Polish immigrants who
were not Local 95 members and agreed to pay them $4 to $5 an hour
on 12-hour shifts seven days a week.
The Kaszycki company, the plaintiffs said, violated the union's
$11-an-hour minimum wage scale and made payments to the local's
welfare funds for only 12 to 15 employees. The contractor also
failed to pay the 200 Poles their full wages, causing work
stoppages and delays in destroying the old building.
The plaintiffs contend that Trump was desperate to meet
demolition and construction deadlines and that his company in May
1980 began supervising the demolition, assuming full responsibility
for adhering to the union contract and for the payments to the
union welfare funds.
When the suit was filed in 1983, the lead plaintiff was Harry
Diduck, a dissident member of Local 95. Diduck had not worked at
Trump Tower but maintained that that he and about 500 Local 95
members and retirees lost medical and pension benefits because
Trump-Equitable and the Kaszycki company owed the union funds more
than $300,000.
After eight years of arguments and a nonjury trial on some of
the issues, in 1991 Judge Charles Stewart of U.S. District Court in
Manhattan ruled that Trump and his associates conspired with Local
95's president, John Senyshyn, to withhold payments to the funds.
He determined that Trump-Equitable owed $325,415 plus interest.
Both sides, however, appealed the findings and each won partial
victories. A federal appeals court upheld most of Stewart's
decisions but ruled that Trump-Equitable had been denied a full
opportunity to rebut the charge that the funds had been damaged by
the loss of contributions for the Polish workers.
