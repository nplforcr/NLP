Washington Mutual Inc., the nation's largest thrift, agreed yesterday to buy 
rival H.F. Ahmanson & Co. for $ 9.9 billion, creating a financial services 
behemoth that would compete with some of the largest banks in the country. 

The combination of Seattle-based Washington Mutual and Ahmanson, the holding 
company for Home Savings of America, would form the nation's seventh-largest 
consumer bank, with 6 million customers and about 2,000 branches stretching from 
Texas to California, as well as in Florida. Ahmanson, of Irwindale, Calif., is 
the second-largest thrift in the country. 

While the sale passed the boards of both companies, it still must be approved by 
regulators. 

Analysts said other thrifts may follow Washington Mutual's lead, with the strong 
economy and a healthy industry leading to more consolidation. 

Industry experts generally applauded the acquisition, saying it would help 
Washington Mutual better compete with large banks such as BankAmerica Corp. and 
Wells Fargo & Co., which it will surpass in size with assets of nearly $ 150 
billion. In recent years, thrifts have begun offering an array of financial 
products, including insurance, mutual funds and brokerage services to compete 
with banks. 

"It's a great acquisition for both Washington Mutual and Ahmanson shareholders," 
said Martin Friedman, a senior thrift analyst with the investment bank Friedman, 
Billings & Ramsey in Arlington. "It creates a powerful consumer franchise in 
California that will be able to compete effectively against the big banks." 

The deal brings together companies that were bitter rivals last year in their 
attempts to take over Great Western Financial Corp., the nation's third-largest 
thrift. It was eventually acquired by Washington Mutual after Ahmanson made a 
hostile offer for the California thrift. 

The purchase is the latest transaction in a rapidly consolidating industry, 
which after being battered by the real estate debacle of the 1980s has made a 
comeback in recent years. 

Last year, the thrift industry earned a record $ 6.5 billion, up nearly 40 
percent from the previous year while the number of problem institutions fell 
sharply to 18 from 29. In 1990, more than 300 thrifts were listed as troubled. 

"We have much healthier and cleaner institutions now," said Ella Allen, 
spokesman for the Office of Thrift Supervision, the federal agency that oversees 
the industry. 

Thrifts take deposits and make loans to consumers and small businesses, 
primarily through mortgages. Unlike banks, thrifts do not make large commercial 
loans. 

Both companies' stocks were heavily traded yesterday. On the Nasdaq Stock 
Market, shares of Washington Mutual closed at a record high of $ 72.93 3/4, up 
1.18 3/4 while Ahmanson shares surged $ 12.37 1/2 to close at $ 77.87 1/2. 

The purchase price, about 19 times earnings, was in line with what other thrifts 
have paid in acquisitions in recent months but slightly less than banks, which 
have been fetching 20 to 25 times earnings. 

"The combination of our two companies will create a West Coast-based financial 
institution competitive with the nation's largest banking companies," Charles R. 
Rinehart, Ahmanson's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. 

Washington Mutual officials said the acquisition will help the company 
consolidate operations and cut annual costs by $ 330 million. It expects to take 
a one-time, $ 254 million charge as part of its plan to slash 3,000 to 3,500 
jobs and close 160 to 170 branches. 

Neither company has employees or offices in the Washington, D.C., area.
