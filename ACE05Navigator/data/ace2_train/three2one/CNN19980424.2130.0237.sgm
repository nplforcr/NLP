 Affordable health
 care
 insurance could soon be going the way of the family
 doctor.
 The New York Times reports that some insurers are considering raising rates
 for managed care an average of seven percent nationwide next year.
 Employees in New York, New Jersey, California, Illinois and Minnesota could
 see premiums go up as much as ten percent.
 Managed care companies say increases are needed to offset huge losses last
 year.
 Critics, though, say the increase undermines the basic appeal of the system.

 But over ten percent?
 uh They had claimed that they were going to save uh money for employers and for
 consumers into the future.
 There seemed to be a one time savings, but now their costs are going way sky
 high, and uh it doesn't look very fair to me.
