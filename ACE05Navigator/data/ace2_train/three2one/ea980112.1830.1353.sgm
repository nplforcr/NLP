 The American Council on Education has released its annual survey on the attitudes of college freshmen, nearly three hundred and fifty thousand of them. And we learned that today's freshmen are more career oriented. Many are bored in class and less inclined than their parents to be involved in the political system. 
<time sec="1372.183">
 Only twenty-one percent of today's freshmen say they vote, and only twenty-seven percent, the lowest percentage ever, say the political affairs of the country are important to them. Thirty years ago, by contrast, fifty-eight percent of freshmen said they were interested in the way the country was being run.

 So why do they go to college? In the survey, seventy-five percent say financial security. In nineteen sixty-eight, only forty-one percent said that earning a living was the main reason for a college education.
