 After thirty years of conflict, and two years of talks, an agreement has
 been reached to bring peace to Northern Ireland. Former US senator George
 Mitchell made the announcement in Belfast after an intense negotiating
 session involving eight political parties and the prime ministers of
 Britain and Ireland.

 To those who disdain democracy, to those whose tools are bombs and bullets,
 your way is not the right way. You will never solve the problems of
 Northern Ireland by violence. You will only make them worse. It doesn't
 take courage to shoot a policeman in the back of the head or to murder an
 unarmed taxi driver. What takes courage is to compete in the arena of
 democracy as these men and women are here tonight where the tools are
 persuasion, fairness, and common sense.

 The historic agreement creates an elective assembly in Northern Ireland and
 a north south council linking municipal functions between Ireland and
 northern Ireland. The British and Irish governments want to present the
 document in a referendum this May. The announcement ends nearly two years
 of intensive talks.

 President Clinton hailed the peace agreement for Northern Ireland, saying
 the strife torn British province now has the promise of a springtime of
 peace. The president called on all parties concerned to stand together to
 defy any attempt to undermine the agreement either through words or
 violence.

 The agreement that has emerged from the Northern Ireland peace talks opens
 the way for the people there to build a society based on enduring peace,
 justice, and equality. The vision and commitment of the participants in the
 talks has made real the prayers for peace on both sides of the Atlantic and
 both sides of the peace line. All friends of Ireland and Northern Ireland
 know the task of making the peace endure will be difficult. The path of
 peace is never easy. But the parties have made brave decisions. They have
 chosen hope over hate.

 Mr. Clinton said the agreement opens the way for people in Northern
