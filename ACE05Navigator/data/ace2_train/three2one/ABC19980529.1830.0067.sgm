 Good evening. When former senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona died today,
 there were a lot of Americans who reached into their memory books to recall
 a story about him. President Clinton called him an American original and a
 great patriot. And people all over the country nodded their heads in
 agreement.
 And yet, when Goldwater ran for president as the Republican nominee
 in nineteen sixty four, he was regarded as an extremist. And he said in that campaign
 that extremism in the defense of liberty was no vice. He was an American
 original, a very blunt Republican who helped to redefine his party.
 He died at eighty nine in the western state of Arizona, to which he was so
 deeply attached. So first, we go to Phoenix and ABC's Brian Rooney.

 Barry Goldwater died this morning in his home overlooking the city and
 state
 he loved. His wife, Susan, was there, and almost immediately friends began
 to arrive. The flag was lowered to half staff at the Arizona capitol.
 Goldwater was older than the state he made famous. He was vigorous
 and rugged into an advanced age. But two years ago, he suffered a stroke
 and later was diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease. Blunt and colorful,
 Goldwater was admired at the end by leaders of both political parties, including
 President Clinton, whose wife, Hillary, worked for the Goldwater campaign
 as a teenager.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="144.693" endTime="148.558">
 That he was a great patriot and a truly fine human being.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="148.558" endTime="156.962">
 He was a man ahead of his time. You look at some of the things they're
 doing now. He was ridiculed for those things. So he was a man of real
 courage, great man.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="156.962" endTime="171.794">
 Nancy Reagan issued a statement. Barry was willing to defy conventional
 wisdom. Although he retired from the Senate more than ten years ago,
 Goldwater stayed active and vocal in politics. One of his last campaign
 appearances was with Bob Dole.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="171.794" endTime="178.327">
 We are the new liberals of the Republican Party.
 Goddamn
 can you imagine that?
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="178.327" endTime="183.201">
 Near the end of his life, he said the thing he was proudest of was being
 born in Arizona.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="183.201" endTime="188.768">
 Having been born in the United States and in Arizona. I don't know how the
 hell you can beat that.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="188.768" endTime="198.516">
 Barry Goldwater's funeral will be Wednesday at Arizona State University,
 followed by burial with military honors. Brian Rooney, ABC News, Phoenix.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="198.516" endTime="207.676">
 In so many ways, Barry Goldwater was defined by the West. He spent thirty
 years in Washington, but he never did lose some of the slightly rough edges. He
 never wanted to.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="207.676" endTime="221.479">
 I sleep at nights. ah I have found that if you tell the truth and tell what
 you really believe, which I have always done, you don't spend the night
 tossing and squirming and thinking, God, Almighty, what did I say?
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="221.479" endTime="243.874">
 Goldwater's grandfather immigrated to the West from Poland and established
 a chain of successful department stores which Barry ran for fifteen years.
 Goldwater was an Army pilot during World War two, and in time he created the
 Arizona Air National Guard. He loved to fly. He ran for the Senate in
 nineteen fifty two and won resoundingly.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="243.874" endTime="247.620">
 Hadn't been for my family voting twice, I don't know.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="247.620" endTime="266.738">
 He established his conservative views very quickly. Although he favored
 racial integration personally, he voted against the Civil Rights Act of
 nineteen sixty four. It is not the job of the federal government, he said, to legislate
 morality. You can't pass a law, he said, that will make me like you or you
 like me.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="268.418" endTime="279.973">
 Goldwater won the Republican nomination for president in nineteen sixty four. To
 his conservative political supporters, he was a savior. In your heart,
 they said, you know he's right.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="279.973" endTime="286.318">
 Extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="286.318" endTime="295.351">
 To his opponents, including President Johnson, who he ran against, he was a
 dangerous extremist. In your heart, they said, you know he's nuts.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="295.351" endTime="300.456">
 Four, five, seven,
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="300.456" endTime="306.780">
 With political ads like this one that suggested Goldwater would get the
 nation into war with the Soviets,
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="308.545" endTime="311.128">
 President Johnson buried him.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="311.128" endTime="321.108">
 When you lose an election by sixty to forty, ah then you can't even begin to think
 of anything you might have done that would have changed it.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="323.271" endTime="339.700">
 But Goldwater's conservative views, he thought the nation could win in
 Vietnam if the military was allowed a freer hand, and he thought the enemy
 at home was the government itself, helped him to win five states in the
 Democratic South, which laid the ground for his party's resurgence.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="339.700" endTime="343.502">
 I give you the next president of the United States, Dick Nixon.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="343.923" endTime="373.986">
 But Richard Nixon proved that Barry Goldwater was never a slavish party
 man.
 In nineteen seventy four at the height of the Watergate scandal, Senator Goldwater was one of the first Republicans to tell Nixon that he should resign. He called Nixon
 the world's biggest liar.
 In time, he would say that Ronald Reagan was either an incompetent
 or a liar, when Mr. Reagan said he didn't know about diverting money to the
 Nicaraguan contras. In time, he would come to be an outspoken supporter
 of a woman's right to have an abortion.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="373.986" endTime="387.410">
 I don't think we should ever tamper with abortion. You'll never stamp it
 out. It's been in, it's been in existence since the world began, and it's going to be
 here when the world ends.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="387.410" endTime="403.881">
 And when it came to gays in his beloved military, he said you didn't need
 to be straight to shoot straight. In the end, Goldwater was very much with
 himself and his family. As he got older, he used to sit on his beloved
 hilltop and say of his critics, to hell with them.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="403.881" endTime="411.339">
 I'd just like to be remembered as an honest person who tried.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="411.339" endTime="450.58">
 We said there were a lot of stories from people today. Just one personal
 note, Ted Koppel and I were two of the young correspondents who covered
 his presidential campaign thirty five years ago. It wasn't always easy for us to
 see the man through the incendiary campaign rhetoric of the day.
 One of the old timers who had covered the White House since Franklin
 Roosevelt's first term surprised us one day when he said that if he was
 ever marooned on a desert island, he would like Goldwater as a companion.
 Goldwater, he said, would know how to get us out of trouble, and he
 would always make interesting conversation. After seeing the senator off
 and on through the intervening years, Ted and I agree today that if we were
 ever marooned on a desert island, Barry Goldwater would have been a perfect
 choice.
