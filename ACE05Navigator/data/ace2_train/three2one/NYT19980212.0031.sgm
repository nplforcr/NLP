NEW YORK _ During intermission, a woman seated in the row behind
me said that she had known the Capeman himself _ Salvador Agron,
the Puerto Rican gang member who killed two teen-agers in 1959 and
who is the subject of Paul Simon's troubled new musical. ``I knew
him,'' she said, in a way that made it clear she only wished she
had known Agron. Then she and her friend, contemplating the embers
of the first half of ``The Capeman,'' began to try out synonyms for
the word ``flat.''
There was a moment of hopefulness as the curtain rose for the
second half, but soon I could smell grief emanating from the
Marquis Theater all over again. Nearly everyone in the audience
felt bad for Simon and his ``Capeman'' collaborators, Mark Morris
and Derek Walcott, but not half as bad as we felt for the actors
onstage, for Ruben Blades, Marc Anthony and Ednita Nazario.
What went wrong? That is the question, naturally. By the time
previews have run their course, as they had when I saw ``The
Capeman,'' the question comes far too late _ too late, even, for
Jerry Zaks, who had been brought in a few weeks earlier to try to
rebalance the story. But by then, everyone had been shackled to a
beast whose destiny they could no longer control.
One of the figures who staggers through this musical is St.
Lazarus, played by Nestor Sanchez. His arrival, the audience
eventually deduces, coincides with moments of revelation or crisis
in Salvador Agron's inner life. I wish that instead of St. Lazarus
it had been the philosopher Aristotle who roamed about the stage
dispensing enlightenment. Here is what he might have said, as he
said it in his ``Poetics'' some 2,300 years ago: ``Tragedy is not a
representation of men but of a piece of action, of life, of
happiness and unhappiness ... and the end aimed at is the
representation not of qualities of character but of some action.''
And Aristotle adds, ``Moreover, you cannot have a tragedy without
action, but you can have one without character-study.''
This, it seems to me, is a fair account of why ``The Capeman''
goes wrong. Instead of a piece of action _ a determining event in
the life of the hero _ this musical gives us the entire biography
of Salvador Agron, from his birth in Mayaguez, Puerto Rico, to his
death at 43 in the Bronx. In fact, ``The Capeman'' insists on the
wholeness with which it presents Agron's life by bringing the
grown-up, redeemed Agron, played by Blades, onstage with his
delinquent younger selves. This is a musical in which all the
action has been replaced by character-study. The result is that the
actors have nothing to do, and neither does the audience, except to
sit on its hands.
Simon's music, so fragile melodically and so unwilling in ``The
Capeman'' to surrender itself to the Latin and pop rhythms it
evokes, only compounds the problem. The songs are the place for
character to emerge, but the lyrics, co-written by Derek Walcott,
are usually narratives, stories. They actually replace the action
that should be developing onstage instead of complementing it. On
its own, the music is moving, especially so because the wonderful
voices of Blades, Anthony and Ms. Nazario intertwine onstage from
time to time. But the music is never on its own. It is always
hampered by the demands of the acting, the stage presentation, even
the sets. Soon it becomes clear that what Simon has written is not
a Broadway musical at all. He has written what should be an
oratorio, a musical drama presented, as the dictionary says,
``without stage action, scenery, or costume.''
There is only one actor for Paul Simon's songs, and that has
always been Paul Simon. When he sings ``I was born in Puerto
Rico,'' as he does on the CD called ``Songs From The Capeman,'' you
understand that he is enjoying the license a song lyric creates,
the singer's ability to falsify his nature as he makes true music.
The songs from ``The Capeman'' sustain just that much pretense, the
transposing of Simon's character alone. But when Ruben Blades sings
``I was born in Puerto Rico'' as ``The Capeman'' gets under way _
trying to lift the plot into life _ you feel that the burden of
creating dramatic belief among the audience is just too great.
Agron does not stir from his grave, not for Lazarus, not for
Aristotle, not even for Paul Simon.
