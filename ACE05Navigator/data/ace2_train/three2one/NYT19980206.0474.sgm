NEW YORK _ One by one, thousands of people made the sign of the
cross Friday night as they walked by the open casket of a man they
never met but came to love by laughing at his jokes every morning
for the past four years.
``He was a member of the family,'' said Carmen Rodriguez, a
43-year-old secretary from the Bronx. ``More than that even. The
one person we listened to everyday. We'll miss him greatly.''
They had come pay their respects to Junior Hernandez, one of the
most popular radio hosts in the city. Hernandez died of a heart
attack Wednesday afternoon, as he walked by the Harley Davidson
Cafe at West 56th Street, just outside the WSKQ-FM studios where
every morning he broadcast his popular show, ``El Vacilon de la
Manana,'' Morning Jam. He was 34 and had chronic asthma.
Since his death was announced by a colleague shortly after it
happened, the station, also known as Mega 97.9, has been inundated
by grieving fans, his colleagues said.
Friday night, mourners lined up for hours outside the Ortiz
Funeral Home in the Bronx just to catch a glimpse of a man they
only knew through his voice. They came as far away as New Jersey
and Connecticut and included a cross section of New Yorkers,
everybody from Benito Rodriguez, a retired cook, to Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani. Police officers controlling the crowd estimated late
Friday night that as many as 12,000 people had filed by Hernandez's
golden casket.
``Why, why him?'' a woman cried as she hugged a friend, who
tried to console her by telling her that Hernandez had gone to a
happier place. ``It's destiny. It's destiny,'' he kept repeating to
no avail.
Hernandez's show was the second highest-rated in the city,
according to the most recent Arbitron ratings, trailing only Howard
Stern's. And, like Stern's, Hernandez's trademark was his ability
to make his audience laugh at jokes so crass that many of his fans
did not dare to repeat them Friday night.
``I remember well the last joke he made, but I can't tell you,''
said Teresa Diaz, 73, who came from Puerto Rico one month ago and
already called herself a fan and friend of Hernandez. ``What I can
tell you is that he always made me laugh.''
Hernandez played an instrumental role in making WSKQ-FM the
third highest-rated station in the city in the most recent Arbitron
ratings. By helping improve his station, he brought recognition to
the growing Spanish-language radio industry, his colleagues said.
``Junior was one of the pillars of the station,'' said Julio
Vergara, programming assistant at the station. ``His knowledge and
passion for his audience made him special.''
In New York, and everywhere else in the United States where
large Hispanic communities have settled, radio plays an important
role. Hispanics immigrants come to this country with a special
affinity for radio. It is from radio, not from television, where
Latin Americans have traditionally gotten their news of the day,
weather updates, entertainment, music, and even the time.
Hernandez's show, which runs from 6 to 10 a.m., mixed all those
elements, plus off-color humor. Like many morning shows, it
included crank calls, parodies and sex jokes. With his irreverent,
sometimes vulgar talk, Hernandez won fans all over the city,
especially young men and women with an affinity for crass language
and fast-paced music.
Vergara said the show will continue with Hernandez's co-host,
Luis Jimenez, and two assistants. Colleagues from the station said
Jimenez was too distraught to go to the service.
At the service Friday night there were few tears. Standing on a
ever-longer line that snaked its way through four blocks, most
people laughed as they remember Hernandez and his jokes.
``I can't cry because that is not what he would have liked,''
said Yamila Reinoso, 18, a college students who arranged her class
schedule around Hernandez's show. ``My days were not complete if I
did not listen to him in the morning.''
Hernandez, who was born in Puerto Rico, started working at a
radio station there right after high school. His cousin, Migdalia
Martinez, said Hernandez missed his high school graduation ceremony
because he had already been hired as a DJ and was scheduled to go
on the air the very same day of the ceremony.
Ms. Martinez said that it had never occurred to Hernandez to be
anything other than a radio host. ``Radio and music, those were his
loves and his life,'' she said.
In 1985, Hernandez moved to New York, working for several
stations before he joined WSKQ in 1993. He had been co-host of ``El
Vacilon de la Manana'' since 1994. His only dream was to have his
own radio station, Ms. Martinez said.
``If he saw this outpouring of love tonight, he would be really
proud,'' she said.
There were people in line in wheelchairs, holding babies,
supported by canes. One woman was on crutches. A man from
Patterson, N.J., Jose Rolon, drove an hour and a half and stood in
line two hours to pay his respects. He was two hours late for the
81st birthday party of his wife's grandmother.
``My wife is going to be mad,'' he said. But Rolon, a
43-year-old postal worker, said he could not miss the opportunity
of give Hernandez a final good bye. ``He always made me feel
good,'' he said.
When Hernandez's casket was taken from the funeral home to a
white hearse, thousands of people lurched forward chanting
``Junior! Junior!'' Some threw flowers and notes. Several waved
Puerto Rican flags.
Hernandez's body was flown to Puerto Rico, where his ailing
parents await it. He will be buried in a family plot in Vega Baja,
a small town to the north of the island, far from his fans.
