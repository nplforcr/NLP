NEW YORK, June 9-
 


Internet related stocks soared today after the NBC television network and Compaq 
Computer Corp. announced deals that will give them greater links to the global 
computer network. 

NBC's decision to buy up to 60 percent of Cnet Inc.'s Snap online service, which 
helps people find information on the Internet, sent Cnet's stock up by more than 
a third. 

Compaq, meanwhile, announced that its newest line of personal computers would 
provide consumers with easy access to America Online Inc.'s computer online 
service and to a personalized Web page run by Yahoo Inc.'s online search 
service. 

The deals spurred a strong rally for a variety of Internet-related stocks, even 
though the rest of the market closed mixed for the day. 

Analysts said that investors were betting that other major computer and media 
companies will be scrambling to snatch up other Internet savvy companies in the 
coming months as the race to capture a share of the network's market 
accelerates. 

"It was lackluster for the rest of the world. But for us, it was great," said 
Alan Braverman, an Internet analyst for securities firm Credit Suisse First 
Boston. "It's a validation." 

Yahoo was among the leaders, rising $ 8.50 to $ 117.87 1/2 in part because 
investors believe that its new ties to Compaq will help guarantee that it will 
remain one of the Internet's central players for the foreseeable future. 

Dulles-based America Online rose $ 3.87 1/2 to $ 88.62 1/2, a strong performance 
helped by J.P. Morgan & Co.'s decision to give the company a "buy" rating and 
set its 12-month price target at $ 110. 

Infoseek Corp. rose $ 4 to $ 27.25, and Lycos Inc. rose $ 3.31 1/4 to $ 53.56 
1/4 after it received a patent for its "spider" technology, another method for 
searching the Internet's World Wide Web. Netscape Communications Corp., which 
develops Web browser software, rose $ 1.37 1/2 to $ 24.18 3/4. Amazon.com, the 
Internet bookseller, rose $ 5 to $ 51.25. 

Meanwhile, Inktomi Corp., which runs an Internet search engine and makes 
software to reduce Internet congestion, raised $ 40.6 million in a 
larger-than-expected initial stock sale, according to Bloomberg News. The San 
Mateo, Calif., company sold 2.3 million shares, an 11 percent stake, at $ 18 
each, the top of the $ 16-to-$ 18 expected range set by lead underwriter Goldman 
Sachs & Co. 

In the Cnet deal, NBC agreed to pay $ 38 million for Snap, a World Wide Web site 
that features such information as news, sports scores and entertainment listings 
and helps computer users find information elsewhere. NBC also said it will pay $ 
26 million for a 5 percent share in Cnet, which operates a variety of other 
Internet services. Cnet stock rose $ 12.12 1/2 to $ 45.12 1/2. 

"It convinced investors [that] other large media companies, over time, will need 
to follow suit," said Lise Buyer, director of Internet and new media research 
for Deutsche Bank Securities Technology Group. 

That would mean that firms such as Infoseek and Lycos, which already have a head 
start, suddenly become more valuable because of today's deals, she said. "If 
Compaq can do this sort of deal with Yahoo, why can't Hewlett-Packard follow 
suit?" she said. "The Compaq deal is a big deal."
