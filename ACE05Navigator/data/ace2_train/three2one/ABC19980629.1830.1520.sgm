 Finally tonight, the new China. Everyone involved with the President's
 trip to China has referred to the new China in one way or the other.
 During
 our own visit ten days ago, we didn't quite get the full import of what
 people meant until we saw Shanghai.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1538.765" endTime="1556.454">
 This is a part of Shanghai called Pudong
 photographed eight years ago.
 Pudong was all farmland then. And this is Pudong just before the President
 arrived.
 Shanghai is the world's largest construction site. Everywhere you
 turn in Shanghai these days, something is coming down or going up.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1557.903" endTime="1566.874">
 Old
 neighborhoods are being turned into rubble. We were there on the eighty-eighth
 floor
 as they finished off the tallest building in China the old fashioned way.

<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1569.185" endTime="1579.856">
 The driving force behind all of this is the mayor of Shanghai. It
 was his idea to have the sky line as the backdrop when we talked. Xu
 Kuangdi once said his city is much like the United States.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1579.856" endTime="1586.872">
 Like New York City, not whole United States. I think Shanghai is the
 Chinese New York City.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1586.872" endTime="1589.562">
 And what do you mean by that?
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1589.562" endTime="1596.683">
 Peoples walk very fast. Aggre- Aggressive people want to do some business
 immediately.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1596.683" endTime="1634.385">
 Fourteen million people in a hurry. In the Shanghainese dialect, the word
 for walk is actually run. They are running here to compete with Hong
 Kong and Singapore in the next century. For almost a hundred years, from eighteen forty-two
 until the second world war, Shanghai was controlled by Europeans.
 The Chinese have decided to preserve the famous bund
 , where the docks used to be on the River Huangpo. But safeguarding a European
 heritage is very much secondary to making something brand new. Tess Johnston is
 an American living here who has written a lot about the old Shanghai, which
 she prefers.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1634.385" endTime="1643.690">
 If some uh Hong Kong fat cat or Taiwan fat cat were to offer them a zillion
 dollars for that site right there, you would be amazed at how fast it would
 probably go down.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1643.690" endTime="1677.35">
 There are all sorts of problems here, too much housing for those who can
 afford it. Half of these are empty. Not enough housing for the poor. Not
 enough public transportation. Too many cars in a city where there were
 hardly any a decade ago. Still, this is China's most progressive city in
 every way. And when you ask about China's future, here in Shanghai they
 say, You're looking at it.
 Not long ago, a Shanghai man is said to have written to a friend overseas
 who was contemplating a visit. Don't come yet, said the Shanghai man,
 It isn't finished.
