NEW YORK _ The printed menu doesn't count for too much at
Manducatis, an Italian restaurant in Long Island City, Queens.
Regulars simply ask for whatever's cooking in the kitchen, have a
brief consultation with the owner, a scholarly looking Neapolitan
named Vincenzo Cerbone, and eat what his wife, Ida, turns out.
There's one dish that always appears midway between the
appetizers and the entree (or entrees), and it's a show stopper. A
small pile of homemade fettuccine _ sometimes plain, sometimes
spinach _ is woven together with meaty slices of sauteed portobello
mushrooms and plum tomatoes, which Cerbone accumulates in season
and stockpiles in glass jars for the winter.
The dish, earthy and intensely flavored, is heady with garlic
and basil, and a touch of hot red pepper gives it a subtle but
unmistakable zing. When it comes to the table and its fragrant
cloud rises, it takes a disciplined diner not to throw himself on
the plate. ``Manducatis'' is Latin. It means ``you eat.'' You do.
The fettuccine with portobello mushrooms costs $8.50. Manducatis
is at 13-27 Jackson Avenue, Queens; (718) 729-4602. Cash only.
