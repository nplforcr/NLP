BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's deputy foreign minister attacked
U.S. National Security Advisor Sandy Berger Friday, accusing him of
``lies and deception.''
Riyadh al-Qaysi picked his way through Berger's press conference
in Washington hours earlier, criticizing the security advisor's
assertion that Iraq had been repeatedly in ``material breach'' of
U.N. Security Council resolutions.
``Iraq challenges (Berger) to produce one Security Council
resolution using those two words,'' al-Qaysi told reporters in
Baghdad.
He said that Berger might not have been concerned with reality,
because he had indicated that if the United States did not have the
Security Council's unanimous support for a military strike, it
would go ahead anyway.
``Everybody knows that under the charter of the United Nations,
the five permanent members have a special responsibility for the
maintenance of international peace and security and there are three
permanent members _ namely Russia, France and China _ who do not
want war, so unanimity does not exist,'' al-Qaysi said.
The deputy foreign minister accused Berger of being part of a
campaign against Iraq.
``This campaign is being conducted on the basis of lies and
deception and should not be taken by anyone in the world as being a
justifiable basis for war.''
``This is exactly what the United States, as supported by the
United Kingdom, are trying to achieve.''
Al-Qaysi took issue with Berger's saying that any U.S. strike
would be aimed at eliminating ``the threat of the use of weapons of
mass destruction by Iraq.''
Berger ``considers UNSCOM to be the body responsible for making
such a determination,'' he said, referring to the U.N. Special
Commission whose inspectors are charged with searching for Iraq's
mass destruction weapons.
``To my mind, and to that of my government, UNSCOM has not made
any reference to an existing threat, as of now, by Iraq against its
neighbors on account of the existence of weapons of mass
destruction. Its reports indicate the contrary.''
Al-Qaysi also criticized British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook
for saying earlier this week that Iraq posed a threat because it
still possessed weapons of mass destruction.
``Nothing can be further from the truth. He should check
UNSCOM's report.''
Referring to the U.S. and British threat to attack Iraq if it
does not give unfettered access to U.N. inspectors, whom Baghdad
has barred from a number of suspected weapons sites on grounds of
national sovereignty, al-Qaysi said the two powers were not seeking
to reinforce the Special Commission.
``The objective is not UNSCOM. The objective is to use military
force per se.''
The deputy foreign minister spelled out the location of the
eight presidential sites that Iraq has offered to open up to
inspectors appointed by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
He said three of the sites were in Baghdad, three were
Salah-Eddine (an area near Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's home town
of Tikrit, north of Baghdad), one was in the northern region of
Ninawa (also known as Mosul), and one was in the southern city of
Basra.
It was first time that a senior Iraqi official had identified
the eight sites.
