PORT HARCOURT, Nigeria-
 PORT HARCOURT, Nigeria

In the struggle over who should rule Nigeria and control its treasure of
oil, no place is more important -- or more on edge -- than this gritty port
and the surrounding swamplands of the Niger River delta.

It has been 28 months since Nigeria's military government executed writer
Ken Saro-Wiwa and other dissidents to quash demands of local tribal
communities, notably that they be allowed to share in billions of dollars
of oil profits pumped from beneath the Nigerian delta.

Authorities keep tight military control on the delta, with frequent arrests
of suspected dissidents.

But opposition to the government and its oil policy is growing, especially
among the young, according to residents and Nigerian political scholars.
The government has long contained dissent by co-opting or intimidating
tribal elders. But the delta's continued poverty and environmental problems
have radicalized youths who "no longer recognize the elders' authority,"
said Chinedu Uchegbu, a researcher for the Port Harcourt-based Institute
for Human Rights and Humanitarian Law.

Protests and violence that began with Saro-Wiwa's Ogoni tribe continue to
spread among other groups, crimping oil production. As Nigeria's military
ruler, Gen. Sani Abacha, appears to be aiming to keep power despite his
promise to permit elections and civilian rule by autumn, many Nigerians
worry that political uncertainty could slide into civil upheaval. The
worries appear deepest in the delta.

Tangled in the conflict are oil companies -- including American firms
Texaco Inc., Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. -- that for years have been the
government's business partners in pumping and selling the delta's oil.

Environmental and human rights groups have condemned oil companies --
particularly the British-Dutch giant, Royal Dutch/Shell Group of Cos. --
for environmental damage and accused them of complicity in the repression
of dissidents, notably Ogonis.

Shell is trying to repair its image with a year-old human rights policy and
funding for a broad development program for delta communities. But Nigerian
scholars warn, and some company officials concede, that the effort can do
little against political repression and poverty in the delta as long as the
military continues to rule.

Nigeria's oil industry boomed in the late 1960s. The more money it earned,
the more the military tightened its control, declaring in 1969 the
government's sole ownership of mineral rights.

For decades, the delta's mostly rural farmers and fishermen have seen
little benefit from tens of billions of dollars' worth of oil pumped out of
their homelands. In Nigeria's joint venture with Shell, which produces
almost half the country's oil, the government takes about 70 percent of the
sales price, Shell officials said. Twenty percent pays production costs,
Shell gets about 5 percent and minor partners share the rest.

Theoretically, the government is supposed to send 13 percent of gross oil
revenues to develop "oil communities." But villages still lack electricity,
running water, schools and clinics, and residents say the development money
is being diverted to enrich government officials.

"The only safe thing to say is that money is flowing" for what are supposed
to be development projects, a Shell official said. "We don't know what is
flowing or to whom."

In 1990, the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People launched
protests, demanding a share of royalties, a halt to oil spills and
political autonomy. The government responded brutally, with sweeping
arrests and military raids on villages seen as dissident.

The protests radicalized and violence spread, in part, according to
Nigerian scholars, because authorities used government-appointed tribal
chiefs to encourage fighting among Ogonis and neighboring groups. By 1993,
Shell was forced to halt its operations in Ogoniland.

In 1994, after four Ogoni tribal leaders were slain, Abacha's government
charged Saro-Wiwa and eight other Ogoni leaders with murder. A special
tribunal, widely criticized as unfair, convicted them of murder the
following year and they were hanged. The executions shattered the Ogoni
protest campaign, forcing many of its leaders into exile.

In Ogoniland, a farming district east of Port Harcourt, a military unit,
the Rivers State Internal Security Task Force, continues to rule. In its
latest crackdown, in January, it arrested at least 40 Ogonis, "not bringing
charges [but] simply locking them away," said Uchegbu, the researcher.
Troops recently have raided churches, warning ministers to stop preaching
about environmental or other political issues, he said.

Nineteen Ogonis, imprisoned on the same murder charges made against
Saro-Wiwa, have yet to be put on trial nearly four years after their
arrests.

Beyond Ogoniland, there has been "an unprecedented militarization of the
[delta] region," Uchegbu said. He and others said a new anti-crime patrol
by police and troops, called Operation Flush, is intimidating people in oil
field villages where protests and violence have increased in the past year.

Last year, hundreds of people died around the city of Warri when young men
of the Ijaw and Itsekiri tribes battled for weeks with cutlasses and
automatic weapons over control of a local government. Government troops
eventually regained control, but the dispute simmers.

Protesters routinely occupy and close oil platforms and other facilities to
get government attention for their communities' grievances. Near Warri last
year, protesters seized several pumping stations, holding 127 Shell workers
hostage for several days.

In the Nembe district, young men often shut down Shell's oil pumps, as they
did last month. At the same time, youths of the Koluama tribe occupied a
Texaco offshore oil platform, demanding electricity, potable water and work
for their communities.

Such protests routinely crimp oil production by 5 percent to 10 percent.

Delta communities complain that continued oil spills foul their lands and
waterways, but Shell says most leaks in recent years have been caused by
people drilling or cutting into pipelines in hopes of getting compensation
from the company for the spills. Isaac Osuaka, an activist with a Nigerian
group, Environmental Rights Action, said there is no way to verify Shell's
account because government agencies are underequipped to monitor spills.

"And this government is the majority owner" of the Shell-run production
company, "so how independent do you think it will be?" he asked.

Following global protests about police brutality and the Ogoni leaders'
executions, Shell has distanced itself from the government's use of force
in the delta. In earlier years, Shell worked closely with Nigerian security
agencies, helping to fund the police that protected its facilities.

The company now resists calling for police help and "will not operate
behind a security shield," said Victor Dania, Shell's public relations
director in Port Harcourt.

Shell says it has "on many occasions publicly appealed for an early and
fair trial" of the 19 Ogonis still held in connection with Saro-Wiwa's
case, and Dania said the company has delivered that message privately "at
the highest government levels."

But Dania conceded there has been "no public response" from Abacha's
government. Human rights groups say Shell is failing to exert the influence
it holds as Nigeria's business partner in exporting nearly half of the
country's oil. They say Shell should publicize its position widely within
Nigeria.

Given that oil provides the military government with 80 percent of its
revenues, "I understand how people think we have a lot of influence over
the government," said Rob Cornish, a senior Shell manager in Port Harcourt.
"But we don't."
