SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Dominican authorities
have arrested a doctor sought by U.S. authorities for defrauding
the Medicare system for millions of dollars while practicing in New
York.
The arrest of the politically well-connected Dr. Rafael Gonzalez
Pantaleon represents another step by Dominican authorities toward
increased cooperation with the United States, which is seeking
extradition of numerous suspects hiding out in their home country.
Gonzalez Pantaleon, a former government official and political
party leader in this Caribbean nation, was convicted in New York in
1996 of defrauding Medicare of dlrs 20 million. He was sentenced to
six and one-half years in prison and fined dlrs 5 million, but he
fled the United States while free on bail.
Officials said Gonzalez Pantaleon was arrested Thursday, one day
after U.S. Undersecretary of State John Hamilton met with President
Leonel Fernandez to ask for the extradition of 30 drug trafficking
and murder suspects believed to be in the Dominican Republic.
Extradition of Dominicans is a controversial topic made more
complicated by conflicting laws. While a 1910 treaty permits
extradition, a law passed in 1969 prohibits Dominicans from being
turned over to other nations. But the latter law did not abolish
the previous treaty.
Fernandez has urged a new law be passed to clear up the
conflict.
Last year, Fernandez handed over to U.S. authorities two
suspects accused in U.S. courts of multiple murders, drug
trafficking and conspiracy.
Fernandez justified the extraditions by saying that the country
could not become a haven for fleeing felons.
