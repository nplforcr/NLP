 A survey by Triple A finds that one in four Americans admits to driving
 aggressively.
 That translates to forty five million aggressive drivers, a much more common
 problem than road rage.
 Drivers with road rage attempt to hurt people with their vehicles.
 Aggressive drivers just lack regard for the safety of others.
 When asked to describe their aggressive driving, fifty eight percent of those
 surveyed said they speed, especially when running late.
 Twenty three percent said they change lanes excessively, and eleven percent
 admitted to tailgating.
