President Clinton had planned weeks ago to devote yesterday to building up 
public interest in next week's State of the Union address. Instead, he spent his 
afternoon with a revolving door of reporters, in a campaign to keep his 
presidency from buckling under the force of allegations about his relationship 
with a former White House intern. 

In a remarkable series of three interviews in which the president was questioned 
bluntly and without apology about adultery and obstruction of justice alike, 
Clinton denied having had a sexual relationship with a then-White House aide, 
24-year-old Monica Lewinsky. But he also repeatedly refused to say whether he 
ever discussed with Lewinsky how she should answer questions about their 
relationship. 

Appearing on PBS's "NewsHour With Jim Lehrer," Clinton emphatically denied that 
he had encouraged Lewinsky to lie to attorneys seeking a statement from her in 
the Paula Jones sexual harassment case. At the same time, he brushed aside 
requests to explain his relationship or conversations with her. 

"I did not urge anyone to say anything that was untrue," Clinton told Lehrer. 
"That's my statement to you." 

It was precisely this suspicion that had engulfed the White House yesterday in a 
furor that aides acknowledged threatens to be the gravest legal and political 
challenge Clinton has faced in five years as president. 

An allegation that Clinton and Washington lawyer Vernon E. Jordan Jr., one of 
the president's closest advisers, coached Lewinsky to commit perjury in the 
Jones case prompted Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr on Friday to 
secretly seek and gain authority from a three-judge panel to expand his 
investigation. 

Only late Tuesday evening did Clinton and his lawyers learn of Starr's new 
avenue and of the potentially damaging evidence -- including taped conversations 
between Lewinsky and a former co-worker -- he has already assembled. 

Within hours of the news of the allegations breaking at midnight Tuesday, the 
White House was in the midst of a full-blown media frenzy, with senior aides and 
lawyers meeting and talking by phone through the night about how to respond. The 
most important element of the response came from Clinton himself -- in three 
previously scheduled interviews he gave carefully worded statements that denied 
some of the most unseemly allegations but left other pressing questions 
unanswered. 

Clinton earlier in the day issued a statement denying that he had any "improper 
relationship," but as the day wore on he was pressed to be more specific. 

"The relationship was not sexual," Clinton told Roll Call, a Capitol Hill 
newspaper. "And I know what you mean, and the answer is no." 

Clinton told National Public Radio that his answers to questions about Lewinsky 
were constrained by Starr's investigation. NPR reporter Mara Liasson asked 
Clinton "whether you had any conversations with her about her testimony, had any 
conversations at all." 

The president responded: "I think given the state of this investigation, it 
would be inappropriate for me to say more. I've said everything, I think, that I 
need to say now." 

Clinton advisers inside and outside the White House acknowledged how unlikely 
these clipped answers are to satisfy the public's demand for reassurance that 
Clinton and Jordan did nothing improper. And, uncharacteristically, they made 
scarcely any effort to play down the severity of their situation. 

Even in a White House that long ago learned to prosper amid political and legal 
controversies, the latest allegations exploded like a bomb on a quiet street. 
Administration officials who had believed they had withstood the worst of the 
Whitewater and Democratic fund-raising investigations recited a long list of new 
problems: 

The allegations, unless effectively and swiftly rebutted, threaten to swamp 
Clinton in a perilous new criminal investigation, aides said; they promise to 
overwhelm public attention that would ordinarily be devoted to the policies and 
rhetoric Clinton will present in Tuesday's prime-time State of the Union speech, 
and already they have badly undermined morale at the Clinton White House. 

Many present and former officials in the middle and lower ranks acknowledged 
privately that they did not see Clinton's careful statements yesterday as 
anything like the full-throated denial they were hoping for. And many of these 
people -- who regularly denounced the Whitewater and fund-raising probes as 
partisan vendettas -- said they could scarcely defend their boss if the new 
charges turn out to be substantially true. "I hope he didn't do these things, 
but if he did he should resign, he shouldn't be president," said one 
administration official who started with Clinton in the 1992 campaign. 

Instead of dismissing the allegations as patently absurd, several people placed 
their hope on more narrow grounds: Would it really be logistically possible for 
the president to carry out the two-year sexual relationship that sources said 
Lewinsky has claimed in the taped conversations with the former co-worker? Could 
it be that Lewinsky had fabricated a tale? 

For senior White House officials, the day began with an injunction not to 
concern themselves with such questions. Chief of Staff Erskine B. Bowles, at the 
7:45 a.m. senior staff meeting, made what aides described as a short, grim 
speech in which he noted the morning's headlines but reminded his team that 
Clinton had faced similar crises and distractions in the past. He told everyone 
to concentrate on their work and turned the floor over to national economic 
adviser Gene Sperling for a discussion of tax policy. 

But few people around the White House were interested in tax policy. "There's an 
air of unreality here," said one White House official. Many staff members 
talking with reporters grilled them on the latest of what they had heard. Many 
said they spent the day glued to the television. Portions of Clinton's interview 
with NPR and PBS were carried live on major broadcast networks. 

CNN went live with White House press secretary Michael McCurry's daily briefing, 
which was uncommonly jammed with reporters and was dominated by extended but 
unilluminating exchanges over what precisely Clinton was denying and what, if 
anything, he was admitting. Repeatedly, McCurry was asked what constituted an 
"improper relationship," each time falling back on a similar response: "I'm not 
going to parse the statement. You've got the statement I made earlier and it 
speaks for itself." 

Likewise, first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, on a day trip to Baltimore to speak 
at a college, found herself pressed for a response on the uproar. 

"Can you say that you flatly believe these latest accusations are false?" a 
reporter asked. 

"Certainly I believe they're false," she replied. "Absolutely." 

Asked if the publicity was difficult for her to endure, the first lady 
acknowledged it was. "You know, I wouldn't say that it is not hard. It is 
difficult and painful any time someone you care about, you love, you admire is 
attacked and subjected to such relentless accusations as my husband has been," 
she said. "But I also have now lived with this for more than six years. And I 
have seen how these charges evaporate and disappear as they're given the light 
of day." 

Last night, the president donned a black tie and the first lady a formal 
evergreen suit to preside at a White House dinner to celebrate the completion of 
a $ 25 million fund for White House restoration. 

As if White House staff members needed to be told of the severity of the 
charges, some of the key political advisers of the first term were there to 
remind them. Former White House senior adviser George Stephanopoulos, now an 
analyst for ABC News, offered a pungent assessment on "Good Morning, America." 
"These are probably the most serious allegations yet leveled against the 
president," he said. "There's no question that . . . if they're true, they're 
not only politically damaging, but it could lead to impeachment proceedings. 

"But they are just questions right now, and that's why I think we do all have to 
take a deep breath before we go too far here, without underestimating their 
seriousness," Stephanopoulos added. 

Political consultant James Carville, who remains an informal adviser to the 
Clinton White House and is often the Clinton team's designated point man for 
attacking Starr, said it is imperative for Clinton's future that the charges be 
dispensed with quickly. 

"The president said they're not true; I believe it," Carville said in an 
interview, acknowledging that many in the public will want more proof. "We've 
got to get to the bottom of it and fast. . . . This could be the 
most-talked-about [controversy] in modern political history."
