 An American classical violin virtuoso with a zest for performing all kinds
 of music recently released a new recording of popular tunes.
 VOA's Martin Bush in New York has her story.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="3126.901" endTime="3175.910">
 Nadia Solerno Sonnenberg is an energetic violin soloist.
 As one critic puts it, she's a risk taker on the concert stage and in life.
 Last year, she would not allow a water skiing accident to stop her from
 performing at concerts.
 The violinist also enjoys deep sea fishing.
 Mounted on the wall of her New York City apartment is a one hundred thirty-six
 kilogram blue shark she caught after an exhausting three hour struggle.
 Now, in concert and recording, Ms. Solerno Sonnenberg, born in Rome, Italy,
 is venturing into a field seldom even approached by her fellow
 violinists, popular music.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="3175.910" endTime="3217.970">
 The reason why is simple.
 I feel like doing it.
 I'm not going crossover.
 There is just, I mean, I will never, ever leave my roots.
 Uh, there's just a desire to do other things.
 And, uh, a very strong calling for it.
 And I am doing them now and having a fantastic time.
 What, what happens, ironically, and I don't think it's any great
 surprise, is when you go and play Brazilian music with phenomenal
 Brazilian guitarists and you go and play, uh, Cole Porter songs, great arrangements,
 with Broadway stars, and then you come back and play Tchaikovsky
 Concerto, you think of the Tchaikovsky in a different way.
 It is a new, fresh piece, regardless of how many times you've played it.

 Nadia Solerno Sonnenberg's latest undertaking in popular music is a new
 recording called Humoresque.
 She performs ten selections on the recording that were all on the
 soundtrack of a nineteen forty-seven film of the same title.
 Humoresque is a weepy tale about an affair between a struggling, talented young
 violinist and his sponsor, a rich, middle aged alcoholic woman.
 At the climax of the movie, the woman drowns herself, having been rejected
 by the violinist.
 As that occurs, the soundtrack sweeps up with the love death,
 segment, from
 Richard Wagner's music drama Tristan und Isolde.
 For Nadia Solerno Sonnenberg, playing that arrangement was a challenge.

 What's fantastic about it is that a violinist does not get to play solo Wagner ever.
 There is nothing written for violin by Wagner unless your sitting in the
 fiddle section.
 And I did when I was young, when I was a student, and I certainly got the feel of what
 it's like to play Wagner and the power of Wagner.
 But as a soloist, uh, playing, uh, wh- what a singer wo- would normally be singing was
 phenomenal experience.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="3347.484" endTime="3354.255">
 One of the selections from the forty-one year old film, Humoresque, is a tune
 by George Gershwin.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="3354.255" endTime="3365.798">
 I grew up listening to songs like that.
 My family, you know, wh- what is played in the, in the household when you grow up
 is what, eh, makes an impression on you.
 That, so since I was a kid, I knew Embraceable You.

 Whatever the thirty-seven year old Nadia Solerno Sonnenberg performs, she has even
 made a rock and roll video, her involvement with the music is total.
 A music critic describes her as an intensely physical player who sways and
 stomps and grimaces and even cries in the grip of her music making.
 Another reviewer praises her for a tendency to treat every musical phrase as though
 she just discovered the deep meaning.
 Four years ago, the violinist accidently nearly sliced through the small
 finger on her left hand.
 A delicate operation restored the finger to full use, but it was a close call.
 These days, as the Washington Post notes, Nadia Solerno Sonnenberg is playing with the
 dedication of someone who has been given a second chance.
