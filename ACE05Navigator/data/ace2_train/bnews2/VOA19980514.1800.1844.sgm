 India says it is not bothered by the possibility of a Pakistani nuclear test
 following New Delhi's five nuclear tests this week.
 The Prime Minister's political advisor, Prahmud Mahajan told the French News
 Agency that India conducted the tests after considering its consir- uh, security
 concerns, so others are free to consider their own.
 Earlier, Indian officials said the country can withstand economic sanctions
 imposed by the United States and others, in the wake of this week's nuclear tests.
 The officials say the Indian economy is strong enough to offset the ban on
 bilateral aid, which they say amounts to only a tiny fraction of the gross
 national product.
 The United States, Wednesday, imposed strict trade sanctions against India, and
 is urging other countries to do the same.
 So far, only Japan and Australia have announced the halt of all nonhumanitarian
 aid to India.
 In a sharp warning to the New Delhi government, Pakistan has told the
 opening ses-

 that it will take whatever action is necessary to protect its
 people from what it called the growing menace of Indian nuclear weapons.
 Pakistan's representative was the first of more than thirty countries to condemn
 India's underground nuclear tests.

 Pakistan rejected international calls for restraint in responding to
 India's nuclear tests.
 Ambassador Munir Akram told the UN conference on disarmament that his
 country would decide alone what measures to take to guarantee its security.
 He said India's actions pose an immediate and grave threat to Pakistan's
 security, and will not go unanswered.

 We will not accept unilateral obligations or commitments.
 We will not accept commitments which would permanently jeopardize the ability of
 Pakistan to deter the nuclear and conventional threats which India poses to
 our security.
 We will not allow ourselves to be subjected to any conspiracy to compromise
 Pakistan's security.

 The Pakistani ambassador criticized other countries for having ignored warnings
 that India was about to conduct nuclear tests.
 He also denounced several industrialized countries, including Canada, the United
 States, Russia, France, and Switzerland, for what he called actively assisting
 India in developing its nuclear and missile programs.
 Mr. Akram said, this week's series of Indian nuclear weapon tests have significantly
 altered their strategic and security situation in the region.
 His fears and condemnation of India's actions were echoed by
 representatives from more than thirty other countries.
 One by one, countries which included the United States, Japan, China, Russia, and
 Germany, expressed shock over India's open defiance of the international community.
 However, India's ambassador, Saditri Kunady, remained unrepentant.

 In undertaking these tests, India has not violated any international
 obligations or undertakings.
 The decision to undertake these tests was taken after due consideration of
 our national security requirements.

 Ambassador Kunady said India remained fully committed to the complete elimination of
 all nuclear weapons, and would participate in what she called effective universal
 negotiations to achieve a nuclear disarmament agreement.
