 There's an invisible pollutant in gasoline that clogs up catalytic
 converters and dirties the air.
 It's sulfur, and as Ed Garsten reports in today's edition of tech trends,
 the petroleum industry is proposing a cleanup.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="629.645" endTime="656.168">
 You can't see it, but sulfur is in every gallon of gas you pump in your
 car.
 The chemical impurity gums up anti-pollution devices, such as catalytic
 converters.
<time sec="639.677"/>
 On the average, there are three hundred and forty parts per million of sulfur in gasoline,
 except in California, where regulations mandate only thirty.
 Now the petroleum industry is proposing to lower sulfur content in gasoline
 sold everywhere, but not as low as in California.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="656.168" endTime="671.536">
 Why should drivers in clean air states like Iowa or Wyoming pay for
 California style gasoline when they would be better served
 with a lower
 priced, more conventional gasoline that still produces environmental
 benefits?
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="671.536" endTime="699.151">
 the proposal calls for cutting sulfur levels in half to a hundred and fifty parts per
 million in gas sold in seventeen states where air quality is a problem.
 Gas sold in every other state except California would have a reduced sulfur content of
 three hundred parts per million. The proposal by the petroleum industry, though, is at
 odds with what the nation's big three auto makers are demanding.
 They want sulfur content in all gasoline to be as low as California levels.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="699.151" endTime="712.607">
 We need those clean fuels like they have in California nationwide so that all citizens
 can get the
 benefit of cleaner air and that all of our cars and trucks will be able to run with
 more reliability on the fuel that's in the marketplace.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="712.607" endTime="739.540">
 Detroit plans to introduce vehicles with more efficient anti-pollution devices as soon as next fall. But the automakers say those devices will work better with California type
 gasoline.
<time sec="723.658"/>
 Well there's no argument over who will pay the price for lowering sulfur levels
 in gasoline.
 That's right, the consumer.
 Estimates range anywhere from a penny to twenty cents more a gallon of gas.
 Some drivers we spoke with say their pockets are only so deep to save the
 environment.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="739.540" endTime="741.977">
 A couple of cents, I mean not a lot.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="741.977" endTime="744.498">
 Five would be good, but no more than that.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="744.498" endTime="754.01">
 Indeed.
 While the federal government will ultimately decide the issue,
 the consumer will ultimately pay.
