 Finally from us this evening, our regular Monday report about how the government spends your money. There's been a lot of talk from the President about getting younger people to buy their way into the Medicare program, letting them anyway. The criticism has been that the Medicare system cannot afford it. Medicare short of money? ABC's Jackie Judd has a classic report on how Medicare spends your money.

 Imagine walking into a grocery store and paying twice as much as you need to for a box of cereal or a loaf of bread, or pulling up to a pump and paying twice as much for a gallon of gasoline. It's what Medicare does every day when it pays for items like wheelchairs, walkers and canes.

<turn speaker="Tom_Harkin" spkrtype="male" startTime="1608.486" endTime="1613.139">
 It's all done legally. This is legal. But it's still a rip-off.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Jackie_Judd" spkrtype="female" startTime="1613.139" endTime="1647.215">
 The rip-off involves the three and a half billion tax dollars spent by Medicare on supplies and equipment every year.

 How could this happen? Unbelievably, Congress and the agency that oversees Medicare do not require competitive bidding by suppliers. In fact, they're paid top dollar at prices fixed way back in nineteen eighty-six, even though prices on the open market have plummeted since then.
<time sec="1640.139"/>
 So somebody could walk into a store and pay far less for a piece of equipment than what Medicare pays?

<turn speaker="June_Gibbs_Brown" spkrtype="female" startTime="1647.215" endTime="1648.077">
 That's true.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Jackie_Judd" spkrtype="female" startTime="1648.077" endTime="1661.693">
 What's also strange but true, is even another government department, the Veterans Administration, pays far less than Medicare. The VA does enforce competitive bidding, and the results are startling.

<turn speaker="Tom_Harkin" spkrtype="male" startTime="1661.693" endTime="1676.924">
 This is a saline solution, very simple saline solution. We found that Medicare was paying uh seven dollars, uh over seven dollars and thirty cents for this one bottle. The Veterans Administration was paying a little over two dollars for the same bottle.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Jackie_Judd" spkrtype="female" startTime="1676.924" endTime="1719.279">
 Another example, Medicare pays seventy-six dollars for the same walker the VA buys for twenty-five dollars. The total overpayment on just eighteen items surveyed, two hundred and thirty-six million dollars every year. Suppliers claim all that extra money guarantees quality.
<time sec="1695.768"/>
 To guarantee the system continues, those same suppliers have invested time and money in cultivating Congress. And so far, it's worked. Congress did recently approve a small program to test how competitive bidding for equipment and supplies works. The critics call that a timid step when billions are at stake.
