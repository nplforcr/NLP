 Extinguish the blaze except for one spot which may be emitting hazardous fumes. Toxic smoke had been pouring from a huge fire at a fertilizer warehouse on the Ohio river.
 More than twenty five hundred people have been evacuated, and four have been
 hospitalized.
 Authorities have just used water on the fire for the first time and
 they say there was a risk the impact of the water on four hundred tons of
 burning ammonium nitrate, might have caused an explosion.
 We are now joined live by Rich Jaffe of CNN affiliate WKRC and Rich.

 Judy we're standing about a mile from the fire.
 the Cargil fertilizer plant is just down the road here.
 Throughout the day from our vantage point we've been able to see a large y- yellow column of smoke towering above the houses here.
 The fire began about three AM this morning and while the scene here is reasonable calm right now, this morning the scene here was quite a different one. Before dawn the sky around Maysville was filled with thick black acrid smoke. The fumes and threat of explosion forcing the evacuation of nearly two thousand people

 My husband went down on the corner to try and get some neighbors up and he like to beat
 had to beat the doors down to get them you know get them up.
 And then some of the older people didn't really want to leave their homes.
 So yeah it it was scary I ain't never had to be evacuated before so I was a nervous wreck.

 Inside the blazing Cargil plant herbicides, pesticides and four hundred and twenty tons of ammonium nitrate, the same fertilizer used to blow up the federal building in Oklahoma city. Residents of Maysville are not the only ones at risk from this fire you can see the smoke blowing the plume across the river and into Ohio.
 We're on a ridge in Brown county overlooking the fire and from up here,
 you can hear the thousands of small explosions down there making it sound
 more like a battle zone.

 early on the decision was made to let the fire burn itself out.

<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="141.967" endTime="172.849">
 w- we felt like at the at the point that we were at that we could not put out the fire with
 the resources we had.
 And the the building had already more or less been destroyed.
 uh we had be- been no benefit of extinguishing the fire and especially with the hazard of explosion,
 we are talking about a large explosion
 and the possibility of uh injuring or or killing several firefighters.
 Uh the gains weren't worth the risks.

 Investigators from the Kentucky state fire marshal's office say it will be days if not weeks before they can determine the cause of this blaze.
 Right now the concern is shifting to that smoke plume and possible environmental impact, Judy.

 Rich any idea when residents can begin returning home?

<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="187.156" endTime="201.326">
 They just finished an assessment of the scene and y- as you mentioned a few moments ago.
 they put water on it for the first time.
 That seems to have been doing the job.
 there is one hot spot left,
 once they get that extinguished, they hope that residents will begin returning to their homes in a couple of
 hours.
