 It's exam week at Princeton University. That means hitting the books. And that's pretty much what you think about when you think about Princeton. A great, in fact one of the very best, academic schools in the world. And it is that, no doubt about it. But it's not academics that has people excited about Princeton this year. Here's ABC's JuJu Chang.

<turn speaker="Bill_Guthridge" spkrtype="male" startTime="1356.732" endTime="1367.714">
 uh I think they're a team that could contend for the national championship. They uh they they really shoot the threes. They go back doors. They're fun to watch. They're aren't fun to play against.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Juju_Chang" spkrtype="female" startTime="1367.714" endTime="1372.862">
 Princeton's coach is flattered, but does not want all the attention going to his players'
 heads.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Bill_Carmody" spkrtype="male" startTime="1372.213" endTime="1379.856">
 I haven't
 talked about being underdogs or being uh favorites. All I tell them to do is to play like underdogs, just work your tails off, fellas.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Juju_Chang" spkrtype="female" startTime="1379.856" endTime="1383.039">
 That scrappy attitude has long been a Princeton tradition.

 Watch these tremendous moves now by Bradley.

 I think that's still the issue today for Princeton athletics, uh can a team of real students uh play in the big time?
</turn>
<turn speaker="Juju_Chang" spkrtype="female" startTime="1397.499" endTime="1406.772">
 Students like Steve Goodrich, a history major student with a three five grade point average. He chose Princeton over three other colleges that offered full scholarships.

 We're probably like the only school in the country where the varsity basketball team has to write, you know, a thesis of eighty pages t- to graduate.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Juju_Chang" spkrtype="female" startTime="1411.841" endTime="1436.852">
 Princeton has always placed a greater emphasis on the scholar in scholar athlete. In past years, they've managed big upsets and to scare a number of high ranking opponents. But this year is different. This team is really good.
<time sec="1425.299"/>
 Ivy League schools offers no athletic scholarships, which means Princeton players get in for earning a three point oh, not just for shooting a three pointer, making it harder to recruit the best athlete.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Mitch_Henderson" spkrtype="male" startTime="1436.852" endTime="1445.202">
 You know, maybe we don't jump as high. uh you know, maybe we don't you know do some things as well but what but what makes us a good team is we we play very well together.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Juju_Chang" spkrtype="female" startTime="1445.202" endTime="1453.886">
 They play well enough to think beyond final exams and dream of the final four. JuJu Chang, ABC News, New Haven, Connecticut.
