 The Massachusetts state treasurer is siding with a seventy-two year old widow in a
 war of words over a multimillion dollar lottery prize.
 Paraskeve Kantges says a lottery ticket she purchased over the phone did win the
 twenty-one million dollar jackpot.
 Kantges says the ticket is one of ninety-six she bought.
 But the store owner who sold her the winning ticket says she called to
 cancel it before the drawing so he paid for the ticket himself.
 State lottery officials have scheduled a formal hearing.
 The state treasurer says the money should go to her because the store
 owner's story is so outrageous.
