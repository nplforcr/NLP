 Medical researchers are warning pregnant women to stop or cut back on their
 consumption of caffeine.
 They have found the drug could increase the chances of sudden infant death
 syndrome.

 Most doctors advise pregnant women to avoid coffee, tea and other
 caffeinated beverages.
 Studies have linked them to miscarriage and low birth weight.
 Now a new study, this one published in the Archives of Disease in
 Childhood shows caffeine consumption during pregnancy may lead to SIDS.

 There's evidence, not great, but evidence that babies who go on to die of
 SIDS are not normal even from their very first day of life,
 which means it's happening sometime prior to tha- birth.

 The study shows heavy caffeine consumption, that is, drinking four or more
 cups of coffee a day throughout pregnancy, almost doubled the chance of
 SIDS. Researchers suggest the reason may be that high levels of caffeine may
 alter the fetus' respiratory system.

 Caffeine is a drug,
 you know, and it has a generalized effect, not only on the mother but as
 well as the baby.
 I- it has an effect on the respiratory centers of the fetus, it should drive
 respirations.
 Whether that has a long term effect, no one knows.

<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1076.150" endTime="1101.65">
 The number of babies dying from SIDS has declined in recent years.
 Some attribute it to the fact that more parents are putting their babies to
 sleep on their backs rather than their sides or stomachs.
 Researchers say more studies are needed looking at the link between
 caffeine and SIDS.
 In the meantime, they suggest pregnant women stop or limit their coffee
 drinking to no more than a cup a day.
