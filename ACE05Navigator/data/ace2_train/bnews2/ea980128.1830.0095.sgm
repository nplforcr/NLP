 Good evening. Yes, the President got out of Washington today, and it was very easy to get the impression that he was happy about it.
<time sec="100.354"/>
 Mr. Clinton has not left his problems behind by any means. But when he went to the Midwest today to stump for the legislation he laid out in the State of the Union last night,
<time sec="108.622"/>
 people were glad to see him, though the trip was not flawless. ABC's Sam Donaldson is with him.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Sam_Donaldson" spkrtype="male" startTime="115.133" endTime="150.255">
 There it was, Air Force One, stuck in the mud at the airport in Champaign Urbana, Illinois. The President on board, unable to proceed.
<time sec="123.969"/>
 Was it a show stopper that the pilot trying to make a tight turn ran off the taxiway?
<time sec="129.316"/>
 But soon, Mr. Clinton and all the plane's baggage were hotfooting it along to a backup craft hastily flown in,
<time sec="135.398"/>
 and a day that was going very well for the President continued.
<time sec="138.652"/>

<time sec="142.811"/>
 When presidents travel, it's always impressive. But for Mr. Clinton today, it was also important.
<time sec="148.194"/>
 What would the people say about scandal?
</turn>
<turn speaker="Al_Gore" spkrtype="male" startTime="150.255" endTime="153.173">
 I'm telling you, we're moving in the right direction.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Sam_Donaldson" spkrtype="male" startTime="153.173" endTime="169.378">
 Vice President Gore was so uncharacteristically animated in warming up the crowd at the University of Illinois
<time sec="158.459"/>
 that people leaped to their feet in response, and his introduction of the President may go down as Al Gore's finest, certainly most impassioned hour.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Al_Gore" spkrtype="male" startTime="169.378" endTime="180.827">
 To join me in supporting him and standing by his side. I give to you the President of the United States of America, William Jefferson Clinton.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Sam_Donaldson" spkrtype="male" startTime="180.827" endTime="188.214">
 For his part, the President talked policy, not emotion. But once on the subject of saving social security, waxed lyrical.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Bill_Clinton" spkrtype="male" startTime="188.214" endTime="198.153">
 I don't know about you, but when I was your age, I never thought about it. I thought I would live forever, always young. 
</turn>
<turn speaker="Sam_Donaldson" spkrtype="male" startTime="198.153" endTime="203.630">
 Always young, and as far as the typical crowd comment here, always forgiven.
</turn>
<turn speaker="spkr_2" spkrtype="male" startTime="203.630" endTime="207.110">
 Really, I don't care. I mean, either way, it doesn't bother me.
</turn>
<turn speaker="spkr_3" spkrtype="male" startTime="207.110" endTime="214.908">
 I think you've got to separate into two pieces, what he's doing for the country
<time sec="209.990"/>
 and, uh you know, his personal obligations, or his personal life.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Sam_Donaldson" spkrtype="male" startTime="214.908" endTime="251.500">
 They clearly loved him in Champaign Urbana.
<time sec="217.153"/>
 But when he finally did get to La Crosse, Wisconsin,
<time sec="220.194"/>
 someone had stamped in the snow a negative comment.
<time sec="224.133"/>
 But here at the rally site in La Crosse, a large crowd is apparently friendly as they listen to President Clinton. So here's the strategy today,
<time sec="231.092"/>
 play on the large, friendly crowds, play on the high polls. But answer no more questions.
<time sec="235.786"/>
 Mrs. Clinton said to Lisa McRee on Good Morning America this morning, no more questions, no more answers.
<time sec="241.275"/>
 President Clinton has said he won't answer questions either. And today, the press secretary said he won't answer questions at least until the investigation is over.
<time sec="249.235"/>
 And Peter, who knows how long that'll be?
</turn>
<turn speaker="Peter_Jennings" spkrtype="male" startTime="251.500" endTime="275.969">
 Sam, thanks very much. Sam Donaldson with the President in the Midwest
<time sec="254.241"/>
 today. Those Americans who heard or saw the President give his State of the Union last night think he was effective.
<time sec="259.153"/>
 In fact, seventy-nine percent say they approved of most of it. Fifteen per cent disapproved.
<time sec="264.276"/>
 The big question is can the President convince the Congress, Republicans and Democrats,
<time sec="268.969"/>
 to do what he would like them to do? ABC's Cokie Roberts is with us tonight.
<time sec="273.092"/>
 Cokie, am I right in guessing that it pretty much depends on the issue?
</turn>
<turn speaker="Cokie_Roberts" spkrtype="female" startTime="275.969" endTime="294.779">
 It depends on the issue, and it depends on the evidence, Peter. uh In talking to people today, those polls got their attention.
<time sec="282.357"/>
 uh They're willing to give the President a little bit more of a chance here.
<time sec="285.949"/>
 And of course, as you say, the issues matter because if it's something
<time sec="289.643"/>
 popular that they want to go along with, they're likely to go along. 
<time sec="292.888"/>
 But they're very worried about this evidence.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Peter_Jennings" spkrtype="male" startTime="294.779" endTime="297.595">
 And bipartisanship could dissolve in a moment, could
 it not?
</turn>
<turn speaker="Cokie_Roberts" spkrtype="female" startTime="297.095" endTime="314.215">
 oh
 I think th- that that's very fair to say. It's an election year, so it was likely to happen anyway.
<time sec="301.643"/>
 But uh Republicans see a big opening here. I mean, they're certainly likely to take it.
<time sec="306.031"/>
 And the Democrats say, you know, there's a great big cloud hanging over us. an- wi- i- It could break open on us, and we're still terribly worried
 about that.
</turn>
<turn speaker="Peter_Jennings" spkrtype="male" startTime="313.594" endTime="316.158">
 Okay, thanks
 very much. Cokie Roberts on Capitol Hill tonight.
