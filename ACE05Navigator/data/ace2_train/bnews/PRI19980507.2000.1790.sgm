 UN secretary general Kofi Annan has faced a fierce attack on the United
 Nations during a visit to the Rwandan Parliament. Rwanda's foreign minister
 said it was simply not good enough for Mr. Annan to blame the nineteen ninety-four
 genocide on a lack of political will among the international community. BBC UN
 correspondent Rob Watson is traveling with Mr. Annan.

 The minister made a catalog of criticisms of the UN, even blaming its
 predecessor, the League of Nations, for Rwanda's history of ethnic
 violence. In response, Mr. Annan said he hadn't expected to face such charges
 in the Parliament and that he wasn't prepared to get into an argument.
 But departing from his prepared speech, he said clearly
 there were failings and he regretted more hadn't been done to prevent the
 genocide. Rob Watson, BBC news, Kigali, Rwanda.
