 A group of US politicians is calling for a twenty-five percent
 increase in the US contribution to the International Fund for Ireland. The
 group says it will push for the increase as a show of support for voters in
 the Irish Republic and British ruled Northern Ireland who overwhelmingly
 approved a peace plan for Northern Ireland last month.

 The group pushing for the increase is led by Democratic Senator Robert
 Toracelli and Republican Senator Alphonse D'Amato. At a news conference
 on Thursday, Senator Toracelli said the victory of the yes vote in last
 month's referendum was an extraordinary step toward peace, but he added
 that for the peace process to succeed, the Irish will need help resolving
 the economic inequalities which exist in the British province.
 Senator Toracelli said the importance of economic development,
 especially in Catholic sections of Northern Ireland, cannot be
 underestimated. He said the goal of increasing the US contribution should
 be to spark economic growth and help create jobs in Northern Ireland, which
 has one of the highest unemployment rates in Europe. The United States
 currently contributes nineteen point six million dollars to the
 International Fund for Ireland.
