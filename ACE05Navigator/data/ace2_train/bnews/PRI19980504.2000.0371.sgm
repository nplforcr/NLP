 This is The World. I'm Lisa Mullins. The Middle East peace talks in London
 are going into overtime, but no one is predicting victory. Secretary of
 state Madeline Albright, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
 Palestinian leader Yassir Arafat have all agreed to spend tonight
 in the British capital. They will continue to discuss a US proposal for
 Israel to hand over more occupied land to the Palestinians in exchange for
 tougher security guarantees. The World's Allen Dow has been monitoring the
 negotiations in London. Allen, the peace process, as you know, has been
 deadlocked for more than a year now. Is there any sign that these talks in
 London could achieve the uh necessary breakthrough?
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="408.687" endTime="446.404">
 Well, it's anybody's guess eh at the moment. The talks uh went ahead all day
 long. They uh, in fact, they talked longer than they thought they would, the first
 round of talks today. Um, secretary of state Albright met with the Israeli
 leader for nearly five hours. Um, that was longer than anybody expected. She
 met with uh the leader of the Palestinians, Yassir Arafat for about ninety
 minutes. But afterwards, you know, nobody was very optimistic, including the, uh, h- her
 spokesman, James Rubin who said to reporters a little bit later on that, ah,
 that the optimism was not high based on the evidence that uh has been seen so
 far, but they're going to continue to work at it, th- ah, meaning the United
 States.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="446.404" endTime="451.472">
 And what else are we hearing? What have the parties themselves been saying so
 far, if anything, about what's been happening today?
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="451.472" endTime="477.061">
 Well, the parties uh themselves are, are basically finger pointing at each
 other. The Is- the Israeli leader, Benjamin Netanyahu came out and said
 that um, after tha- those five hours of negotiations that that he thought
 that progress was being made. But the Palestinians have said all along that
 they think this is just a stalling tactic, that in fact, uh the Israeli
 leader is is just trying to buy some time here and make it look like he's
 negotiating when, in fact, there are no ah real solid proposals on the table.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="477.061" endTime="484.844">
 And the way these talks are happening, uh no face-to-face talks apparently right
 now, the different parties, Yassir Arafat and Benjamin Netanyahu are
 actually in different hotels.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="484.844" endTime="496.950">
 That's right. the- Madeleine Albright has been sort of shuttling back and
 forth uh through the day and the night speaking to both sides. Um, the two
 sides will not meet together. Uh, they may at some point, but right now
 that's just not in the cards.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="496.950" endTime="504.997">
 The US proposal is for Israel to withdraw from another thirteen percent of the West
 Bank. Uh wh- why is it that uh Benjamin Netanyahu cannot accept that?
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="504.997" endTime="525.039">
 Well, he says that ah Isr- i- i- it's a question of security and that Israel ah really
 can't give up anymore than nine percent uh of the west bank. If you look on a map, Tel Aviv- v, the capital, is very close to uh, to uh the west bank, which, of course, is is the
 biggest occupied territory. They say to give up any more more of that, it would uh, it
 would place t- the the capital in jeopardy from further attack.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="525.039" endTime="528.983">
 And is there anything new on the table in these talks today?
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="528.983" endTime="542.360">
 At the moment i- it's not clear exactly what is on the table. These talks are
 being held in private. Nobody's letting us know what is going on. But um
 e- everybody seems to be pessimistic right now that uh things are not looking too good.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="542.360" endTime="545.538">
 The World's Allen Dow speaking to us from London. Thanks very much, Allen.

 Thank you.
