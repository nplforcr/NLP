 Another remnant of the Gulf War. A new study today suggests that as many
 as four hundred thousand
 American troops may have been exposed to particles of something called
 depleted uranium during the Gulf War. It is a nonradioactive metal used to
 make shells and bombs, and exposure to large amounts of it can cause kidney
 problems. The government has concluded that there is no link between
 depleted uranium and Gulf War syndrome.
