 This is the world in Boston. I'm Lisa Mullins. China's new premiere was
 greeted with thunderous applause today in Beijing's great hall of the people.
 Ju Rong Zhi actually had been selected months ago by the communist party leadership to
 overhaul China's crumbling state industry and its ailing banks. The man he
 replaces, Li Pung, was elected today to head the national legislature. Ju Rong
 Zhi becomes premiere as China's export fuel growth is stalling, a victim of the Asian
 financial crisis, but as the world's Alan Dow reports, Ju is as prepared
 as anyone to take the tough steps needed to recharge China's economy.

 As mayor of Shanghai ten years ago, Ju Rong Zhi turned the long neglected city into
 the emerging financial hub of China. In his most recent job as China's chief
 economist, Ju was the darling of Western captains of industry who are keen
 for a piece of the action in the world's largest captive market.

 Please don't come too quickly.

 If you come too quickly and if you can't make money because of that, please
 don't make complaint to me.

 Thank you.

 Ju Rong Zhi has a reputation for getting things done. In China, he's known as the
 boss. Ann Yeng of the US China business council in Beijing says that's why he
 was chosen as China's new premiere.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1348.617" endTime="1368.242">
 He personally follows up on on all of his policies and directives. He uses
 a meritocracy. He puts in place people who are uh capable and also respond and
 also he's willing to fire people, which is pretty unusual in China. And so
 people do respond when Ju Rong Zhi wants something.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1368.242" endTime="1396.923">
 But Ju's new mandate will be as challenging as any he's faced so far. As
 premiere, his first big task will be to streamline China's bloated and
 corrupt bureaucracy. Three and a half million civil servants are to be laid off in
 the next year and many state enterprises will be auctioned off, merged or closed.
 There are many politicians who won't appreciate some of the cuts Ju is about to make
 but Ann Yeng says cut he must if China is to overcome its economic problems.

<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1396.923" endTime="1424.791">
 The root cause really is state owned enterprise and the failure so far to
 reform state owned enterprise in a really significant way and therefore the
 failure to reform the state banking system which is uh completely intermingled
 with the state system. This requires a whole lot of political pain, and so
 it's a very, very frightening or bracing task, but Ju Rong Zhi has taken steps that
 show he's really serious about it.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1424.791" endTime="1436.293">
 Ju may be serious about tackling the country's huge bureaucracy, but
 whether he will move the premier's office from the shadow of its most notorious
 moment in recent history isn't so clear.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1440.641" endTime="1459.528">
 Ju's predecessor Li Pung became infamous as
 the man who ordered the tanks into Tiananmen Square. A
 fledging move towards democracy was crushed and both China and Li have
 faced the scorn of many westerners ever since. But China's economic reform under
 Li's premiership will undoubtedly be his swan song.

 Speaking to the people's congress recently, Lee thanked governments and companies
 around the world for what he called their sympathy and support for China's
 modernization. A modernization that Ju is suited to continue. According to professor
 Song Ko Ching of Beijing University.

 especially is the uh reform process, different people have different opinions
 so there needs to be someone who has some
 hard ch- uh characters I mean here is
 a man who can get agreement from others.

<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1500.762" endTime="1511.324">
 The number of TV commercials for consumer goods is evidence of how times
 have changed in China, change the country's new premiere seems ready to
 accelerate.
 For the The World, I'm Alan Dow.
