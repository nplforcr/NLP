 People sometimes wear jewelry to bring out their features.
 Jeanne Moos shows us a piece of jewelry that lets folks know how you feel,
 and this one puts that old mood ring to shame.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1511.630" endTime="1517.901">
 It would make a fine gift for a female cardiologist.
 I can't see down there, is it

<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1518.437" endTime="1524.906">
 my brooch.
 But if this brooch stops beating, better call nine one one.
 It's beating to my heartbeat.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1524.906" endTime="1526.053">
 Oh, cool.

<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1526.053" endTime="1535.937">
 Harry Winston Jewelers on Fifth Avenue prides itself on selling rare
 jewels of the world.
 But it's a really rare jewel that requires you to strap on electrodes.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1535.937" endTime="1537.733">
 Bare skin, below the nipples.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1537.733" endTime="1554.766">
 The electrodes transmit your heartbeat to this receiver, which activates
 light emitting diodes that make the six red rubies pulse surrounded by
 diamonds.
 We'll see if it's accurate.
 Wow, it really does match.
 They don't call it the heartthrob brooch for nothing.
 Good idea? Dumb idea? We

</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1554.766" endTime="1556.584">
 I think it's stupid.

 don't get the point.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1558.105" endTime="1567.464">
 Well, the media lab at MIT developed the technology.
 Professor Michael Hawley thinks there's a big future for accessories and
 clothing that monitor your health.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1567.464" endTime="1573.872">
 Y- you get dressed in the morning, pull on your pants one leg at a time.
 And your clothing starts to make those sorts of measurements.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1573.872" endTime="1584.565">
 You think that's far fetched?
 Professor Hawley can already monitor the internal temperature of climbers
 scaling Mount Everest.
 They swallow a pill that's actually a radio transmitter.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1584.565" endTime="1589.618">
 Well, we like to joke that you'll be able to see the reading on a rectal
 thermometer.
 With the climber on the summit of Everest.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1589.618" endTime="1595.038">
 Don't try that with the brooch.
 This is a prototype.
 It's price tag is enough to cause heartburn.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1595.038" endTime="1598.168">
 Two hundred. hm. One thousand.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1598.168" endTime="1599.518">
 A hundred thousand.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1599.518" endTime="1600.153">
 keep going.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1600.153" endTime="1602.490">
 Five hundred can't be.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1602.490" endTime="1606.403">
 very good.
 um. I think you're in cardiac
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1605.988" endTime="1606.403">
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1606.403" endTime="1607.701">
 think I am, too.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1607.701" endTime="1613.914">
 We had to have a security man accompany us as we showed the brooch to folks
 on Fifth Avenue.
 We let this woman wear it.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1613.914" endTime="1615.185">
 Am I beating?
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1615.185" endTime="1619.103">
 You're beating to my heart.
 Is anything happening?
 Is it going faster?
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1619.103" endTime="1620.521">
 I can- I can't really eh tell.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1620.521" endTime="1631.502">
 Well, you could tell after doing a set of situps.
 This is before, this is after.
 The mere sight of someone attractive would not make your heart beat faster,
 really.
 I mean, that's just what you see in the movies.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1631.502" endTime="1632.160">
 Could.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1632.160" endTime="1638.205">
 Will you end up like ET, extra transparent?
 Well, a stranger's hug had no impact.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1639.607" endTime="1641.876">
 nor did the sight of a handsome man.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1641.876" endTime="1643.210">
 So much for that experiment.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1643.210" endTime="1648.593">
 But when the heartthrob brooch was first introduced, Leonard Nimoy, alias
 Mr. Spock
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1648.593" endTime="1650.384">
 Do you know anything about vulcans?
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1651.708" endTime="1654.408">
 Got to kiss a model.
 Both were wired.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1659.456" endTime="1666.00">
 and both their hearts raced.
 You can't bypass this brooch.
