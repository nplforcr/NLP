 You've seen it, you may have done it.
 Now the federal government is calling for a crackdown on drivers who speed
 through red lights and stop signs.
 The transportation department says aggressive drivers accounted for eighty-six hundred
 deaths in crashes in intersections in nineteen ninety-six.

 Twenty-six hundred were killed in wrecks where drivers ran red lights. Six thousand were killed in crashes in which drivers ignored stop signs.
 Transportation secretary Rodney Slater says a pilot program to educate
 drivers about these dangers will be expanded in the country. He says the
 program has reduced red light accidents by forty-three percent in some communities.
