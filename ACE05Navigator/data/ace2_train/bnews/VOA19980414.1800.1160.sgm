 United Airlines, the largest US air carrier, has ordered twenty-three jumbo
 jets from Boeing Company worth up to three point two billion dollars.
 The order is made up mostly of Boeing seven seventy-sevens.
 Analysts say the order shows the airline's optimism about its
 international expansion plans, even as traffic slows in the Asia Pacific Region.
 United said, uh, last month that its expansion plans include adding sixty-eight
 planes to its five hundred seventy-one plane fleet by the end of two thousand one.
