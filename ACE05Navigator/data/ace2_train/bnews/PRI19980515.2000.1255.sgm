 This is The World. I'm Tony Kahn. A hundred years ago the United States emerged
 from the Spanish American war a world power with a reach that extended to
 the Philippines, Guam, and Puerto Rico. For Spain, the war also marked a
 turning point. Madrid was forced to cede those three territories to the
 United States and grant independence to another of its possessions, Cuba. This
 week our series on the Spanish American war's legacy has focused on the
 war's victor and the spoils of victory. In our final report, The World's
 Megan Cox Gerden examines the war's disastrous yet strangely liberating
 impact on the loser.

 By eighteen ninety-eight Spain had been fighting a full-fledged Cuban insurrection
 for three years, and its draconian tactics were provoking an international
 outcry. Spanish troops were rounding up Cuban civilians into what were
 effectively concentration camps and laying waste to the countryside.
 Peasants were dying by the tens of thousands. With the sensational American
 press of the day amplifying every atrocity, it became impossible for US
 politicians to ignore continued Spanish rule in Cuba. Historian Edward
 Malifakis at Columbia University in New York believes the American press
 inflamed the public's desire for US military intervention in Cuba.

 Spanish behavior was there was obviously cruel, but no crueler certainly
 than it usually is in, you know, most wars and nothing remotely like the
 kind of th- stuff that's happened subsequently. But it was enough to create
 a movement in the United States of th- a pro-war movement.

<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1351.759" endTime="1416.738">
 The Spanish government resented American interference in the running of what Spain
 believed to be its God given empire. So, as American newspapers overflowed
 with gory tales of Spanish cruelty in Cuba, and American politicians
 demanded that Spain let Cuba go, Spanish newspapers were whipping up sentiment
 against the United States. Caricatures depicted Spain as a ferocious
 lion and the United States as a pig, wallowing in its wealth but too fat
 to fight. In truth, the Spanish lion was geriatric, toothless. The cost
 of maintaining its occupying army in Cuba had left Spain nearly bankrupt.
 The war on that rebellious island brought heavy social costs as well.
 Resentment seethed among conscripted soldiers who were in Cuba only
 because they couldn't afford to buy their way out of the draft as the
 aristocracy could. Accounts from eighteen ninety-eight show that Spain's top military
 men knew they couldn't prevail against the United States. Spanish
 politicians knew it, too. But according to Mark Hayes, a historian with the
 US Navy, Madrid felt it could not back down.

<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1416.738" endTime="1431.570">
 In general, I mean I have a lot of sympathy for the Spanish government at
 the time, because they're, they're trying to put things back together after a lot
 of problems that really began with the French intervention in the country
 in the Napoleonic wars. And they're still trying to deal with the effects of that.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1431.570" endTime="1455.288">
 That French intervention started with Napoleon installing his brother
 as king of Spain and ended with the great armies of Europe fighting it out on Spanish
 soil. The wreckage of that war left Spain in a terrible position to take
 on the United States in eighteen ninety-eight. But Jaime Ojeida, who recently retired as
 Spain's ambassador to Washington, says the weak government in Madrid was
 squeezed by circumstance.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1455.288" endTime="1465.477">
 The Spanish, uh, th- public opinion was very strongly moved by the idea of uh honor,
 the honor of the country, the honor of the armed forces.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1465.477" endTime="1503.166">
 But Spanish honor was no match for a superior foe. And Spain's American colonies fell
 swiftly, first Guam without a fight, then Cuba and the Philippines with the
 Spanish fleet sunk in a day in each place. By the time American troops
 turned their guns on Puerto Rico, Spanish resistance had lost its gusto.
 Recently opened diplomatic cables to Puerto Rico from Madrid show that
 Spain instructed the island's defenders to resist if possible. Historian
 Luis Agrait of the University of Puerto Rico says that was a far cry
 from Spain's noisy vow to defend its empire to the last peseta and the
 last man.

<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1503.166" endTime="1530.663">
 Spain would have preferred to avert a war. Spain, apparently, the government
 uh feared that if they lost Cuba eh without putting up a fight, first of all
 the monarchy could collapse, uh and there could be a, a financial collapse in
 Spain, and uh there would also be a a collapse of the public finances.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1530.663" endTime="1549.780">
 As it happened, none of the worst Spanish fears, apart from losing Cuba,
 materialized. The monarchy and government both survived the war. Spain's
 economy improved and Spain enjoyed a renaissance of culture and ideas, a
 rejuvenation that historian Edward Malifakis says sprang from humiliation.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1549.780" endTime="1563.415">
 You go and fight against an enemy and, you know, the enemy hardly without uh any effort
 dest- defeats you and that s- reveals your incompetence and your backwardness and so on,
 so there was a great psychological shock to them.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1563.415" endTime="1582.805">
 That shock produced what's called the generation of eighteen ninety-eight,
 a loose collection of writers, artists and thinkers who used the disaster
 as a way to probe the deepest questions of Spanish identity. The generation
 of eighteen ninety-eight was sometimes pitiless in its introspection. One
 leading intellectual, Ortega Igaset, wrote,
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1582.805" endTime="1591.146">
 Spain today, rather than a nation, is a cloud of dust remaining after a
 great people have galloped down the highway of history.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1591.146" endTime="1597.049">
 Spain was no longer an empire. Again, former Spanish ambassador to
 Washington, Jaime Ojeida.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1597.049" endTime="1625.768">
 It was a medium power. Not maybe, not a strong. Economically rather
 backward, with many problems at home. A loss of Cuba somehow removed the
 shackles of um imperial ideology, a bit like what happened in Great Britain
 after the second world war, and the nation started uh beginning to think of
 itself as uh Spain, following the British example, as little Spain.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="1625.768" endTime="1652.67">
 Loosing what Ojeida calls the shackles of imperialist ideology did not
 produce overnight the peaceful European country Spain is today. Far from
 it. Spain was to endure civil war and a thirty-six year dictatorship before
 emerging as a stable democracy. But historians believe eighteen ninety-eight was a turning point in Spanish history, when Spain woke up from its
 long imperial dream. For The World, I'm Megan Cox Gerden reporting.
