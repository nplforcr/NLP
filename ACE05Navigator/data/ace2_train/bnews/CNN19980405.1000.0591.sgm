 World-class skiers say balance is everything.
 Now a new device is helping skiers save precious time going downhill.
 Rick Lockridge reports, it also helps nonskiers freeze pain in its tracks.

 Going for his fiftieth world cup victory.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="606.842" endTime="614.090">
 For world cup skiers like Alberto Tomba, the difference between winning and
 finishing back in the pack is often a single, thin second.
</turn>

 Now this is a different slalom course than they have used in the past.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="617.451" endTime="624.982">
 Or less.
 At this level, the slightest edge in speed and balance can crown a
 champion.
 While the tiniest technical flaw can be costly.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="627.018" endTime="628.922">
 Out of the race course.

 Seeking that tiny but decisive competitive edge, many of Italy's Olympic
 skiers come here to the laboratorio alto prestazione, the high performance
 lab, in Santa Caterina, Italy.
 What they're asked to do here literally makes their jaws drop.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="642.861" endTime="645.063">

 Changing the bite is just one of many modes that you can use to help you to
 eliminate the interferences.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="652.913" endTime="677.693">
 And this silver and green box is what finds the problem.
 It's the lizard med scale, a scale that measures precisely where your weight
 is distributed. It can show you exactly where you're out of balance.
 When world cup downhiller Pitro Vitialini steps on the scale, it shows him
 to be several pounds heavier on the right side of his body, as shown by the
 red lines.
 A decision is made to give Pitro a custom mouthpiece, in the hope his jaw
 will line up properly, and the rest of his body will follow.

<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="680.235" endTime="690.991">
 We adjusted my bite.
 And in effect, I improved my performance quite a bit.
 And so I believe in the system.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="690.991" endTime="695.823">
 Athletes aren't the only ones affected by body imbalances.
 Ordinary people are, too.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="695.823" endTime="698.680">
 Hold it.
 Resist.
 Very good.

 Chiropractor Alfio Caronti says the lizard med scale allows patients to see
 for themselves the alignment problems that are causing their pain or
 injury.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="706.433" endTime="712.630">
 So, the scale has been uh helping to show that uh w- we're seeing the truth.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="712.630" endTime="727.420">
 Open the lizard med scale and you find six sensors. Three for each foot.
 The sensors feed data into a software program which can actually calculate
 the body's posture.
 Green readouts indicate good balance, yellow means you're on the border,
 and red means you're really out of

<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="726.806" endTime="727.420">
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="727.420" endTime="728.533">
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="728.533" endTime="741.706">
 It's not like I get on that scale, they tell me what's wrong, and all of a
 sudden, I'm a better skier.
 But the information that I get allows me to achieve better balance, and if I
 can continue to maintain that balance, I ski better.
</turn>
<turn speaker="unknown" spkrType="unknown" startTime="741.706" endTime="755.00">
 Someday soon, even ordinary skiers and nonskiers may find themselves
 standing on the green lizard like marks that give this promising device its
 name.
