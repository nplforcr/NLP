 And Phil Jackson said his goodbyes on Monday, as the head coach of the
 six time world champion Chicago Bulls, of the National Basketball
 Association.
 Jackson had said all year that this year would be his last, and within the
 past few days, turned down an offer from the Bulls' management to coach for
 another season.
 And, Mr. Jackson's future is unclear, except he will be going on a
 well-deserved vacation to Turkey, with US Senator, uh, Bill Bradley, a former
 teammate of Jackson's on the New York Knicks.
