BTG Inc.'s chairman yesterday rescinded the dismissals of four vice presidents 
who were unexpectedly fired Monday after an abortive bid to purchase a BTG 
division, company sources said. The executives were allowed to resign instead. 

Ed Bersoff, the Fairfax company's chief executive, announced the decision in a 
company-wide electronic message sent out after 5 p.m. The e-mail message, a copy 
of which was obtained by The Washington Post, said the four vice presidents have 
"chosen to resign effective February 6, 1998, to pursue other interests. I 
regret any disruptions that may have been caused to these individuals or others 
in the company." 

The e-mail was part of a settlement agreement between BTG and the four vice 
presidents. Neither party would discuss the details of the settlement. 

The vice presidents -- Scott Reynolds, Paul Collins, Steve Schlosser and Brian 
Nightingale -- had joined with another company vice president to make a $ 28 
million cash bid for the company's technology systems division. 

BTG had previously agreed to sell the division to a fierce rival, 
Chantilly-based Government Technology Services Inc., for about $ 23 million in 
cash and stock, but the five BTG executives never appeared to have lined up 
viable financing for their offer. 

BTG expects to close the deal with GTSI in the next few days. The division being 
sold is a fast-growing but marginally profitable unit that filled large computer 
orders from government agencies. 

On Monday morning at 11:30, Bersoff fired the four vice presidents at an 
impromptu meeting. Four lower-level staffers who worked closely with the 
executives also were fired later that day; Bersoff rescinded those terminations 
too, according to the e-mail company employees received yesterday. 

Steve Baldwin, the fifth BTG vice president involved in the management bid, 
resigned Monday night. Baldwin, the most senior official within the management 
group, said yesterday he has a number of issues with BTG left to be resolved 
"that I am assessing as I move forward." 

Bersoff leveled several allegations against the vice presidents as he fired them 
Monday, but no one present at the meeting would discuss them on the record. 

Later Monday, however, Bersoff sent out a company-wide e-mail in which he said 
the four vice presidents had been fired "with cause" and that they had engaged 
in activities "designed to disrupt BTG's operation and to put the job of all the 
technology systems employees at risk." 

The vice presidents vehemently denied any wrongdoing, and spent much of the week 
meeting with their lawyers. 

"We are pleased on behalf of the terminated officers and employees to have 
achieved the recision of the termination for cause," said Jack McKay, an 
attorney at the Washington office of Shaw, Pittman, Potts & Trowbridge who is 
representing eight of the nine BTG employees who left the company. 

"My clients are very satisfied with the e-mail that was distributed today." 

Bersoff, who was reached in Hawaii, where he is attending a conference, would 
not comment on the firings or yesterday's e-mail beyond saying, "The parties 
have reached an amicable resolution of their differences."
