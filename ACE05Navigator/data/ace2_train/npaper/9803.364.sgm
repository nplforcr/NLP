JAKARTA, Indonesia, March 10 (Tuesday)-
 


Indonesia's legislature appointed President Suharto, Asia's longest serving 
leader, to a seventh five-year term today after granting him sweeping new powers 
in the midst of the country's worst economic and political crisis in three 
decades. Suharto was elected by the largely appointed 1,000-member People's 
Consultative Assembly. 

The text of the "special powers" decree enacted by the assembly on Monday has 
not been made public, but political analysts say it likely draws on a similar 
measure, stemming from the upheavals of the 1960s, that was shelved a few years 
ago. Indonesia, the world's fourth-most-populous country, with 200 million 
people, is suffering its worst turmoil since that turbulent period, and there 
have been mounting calls for Suharto to step aside. 

"There's no way you can have political reform while Suharto is still in power," 
said one young activist leader who has been among thousands of university 
students demonstrating for political and economic reform in several cities since 
the assembly meeting began ten days ago. 

He said protests will continue after the assembly ends on Wednesday, when 
Suharto is sworn in and the vice president is chosen. Local newspapers reported 
that six students were arrested on Sunday. Security forces have held back from 
intervening, despite a government ban on demonstrations and large gatherings 
during the election period. 

In Washington, the crisis got an extraordinarily bleak assessment from Michel 
Camdessus, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, who voiced 
fears that Indonesia could drag down neighboring countries that have begun 
recovering from their own crises. 

"Even if you have the impression that we have made important progress in 
handling the Asian crisis, even if you are under the impression that Thailand 
and Korea have turned the corner, we are not there by far in Indonesia," 
Camdessus told a luncheon during an IMF-sponsored seminar. "If this problem is 
not solved soon, the whole thing is at risk." 

Indonesia's newly appointed armed forces chief has signaled he will be tough on 
protesters after demonstrations against high prices turned into riots in a 
number of cities last month. 

"If people are hot-tempered and ready to cut down the symbols of the state, yes, 
I will gladly prohibit them. If they are still determined, I will be determined. 
The difference is they are breaking the law, I am protecting the law," Reuters 
news agency quoted Gen. Wiranto as saying in Forum Keadilan magazine. 

There has been speculation that the special-powers decree would allow Suharto to 
take a harder line against his opponents in the name of preserving national 
unity during the current turmoil. But reformers are skeptical. 

"I don't see the need of it because he has special powers already," said one 
Indonesian political analyst, who, like many government opponents these days, 
did not want to be identified. 

Some analysts said the decree could allow the 76-year-old leader, who was ill 
late last year, to override the constitution in naming a successor. Such a move 
would provide fodder for those who criticize the government as feudalistic. 
After an outspoken and widely respected magazine last week ran a cover depicting 
Suharto as the King of Spades, the government took legal action against its 
editors. 

The president's children, who have wide-reaching and lucrative business 
interests in Indonesia, have increasingly taken on the role of spokesmen for the 
administration in the political vacuum leading up to the naming of a new 
cabinet. The consultative assembly, which is largely appointed by Suharto, 
includes his relatives, friends and military representatives. 

The political transition has been cited by officials from the IMF in explaining 
why they decided to delay the latest payment of the IMF's $ 43-billion bailout 
of Indonesia. Officials announced last week that the $ 3 billion slated to be 
paid on March 15 will be held up at least until April. 

The IMF and Suharto have been locked in a standoff over the economic rescue 
package, with the West demanding a quick implementation of reforms and Suharto 
dancing around the measures he twice vowed he would carry out. He also has been 
dangling the idea of pegging the Indonesian rupiah to the dollar -- a plan 
inspired by American economist Steve H. Hanke that the IMF and Washington have 
warned Jakarta against. 

Both IMF and Indonesian officials sought today to play down their sparring -- 
which has roiled Southeast Asian markets -- following comments Suharto was 
quoted as making over the weekend that led some analysts to fear the president 
had dug in his nationalist heels and decided to reject the bailout altogether. 

Jusuf Syakir, chairman of the Muslim-dominated United Development Party, emerged 
from a meeting with Suharto on Sunday announcing that the president said the IMF 
reforms were "not in line" with the constitution. Specifically, Syakir quoted 
Suharto as saying, the reforms went against an article stipulating that the 
economy should be organized "based upon the principle of the family system." 

Few Indonesians, foreign businessmen or diplomats missed the irony in a 
statement coming from a president whose family has amassed more than $ 16 
billion over the past three decades and helped inspire the term "crony 
capitalism." 

Today Bambang Trihatmodjo, one of Suharto's tycoon children and a senior 
assembly member, said the IMF agreement might have to be renegotiated, the 
Associated Press reported.
