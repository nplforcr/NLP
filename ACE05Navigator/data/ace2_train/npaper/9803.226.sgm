Comsat Corp. said yesterday that it has a buyer for its RSI satellite equipment 
manufacturing division, nearly one year after putting it up for sale. 

The Bethesda-based satellite communications company said that TBG Industries 
Inc., a privately owned New York holding company, would buy RSI for $ 116.5 
million. 

RSI, based in Sterling, designs, manufactures, installs and operates 
ground-based satellite antenna systems, air-traffic control radar, radio 
astronomy antennas and other communications systems for military and commercial 
use. 

The sale reduces Comsat's payroll almost by half: RSI employs 1,200 of Comsat's 
2,600 workers. TBG officials did not return calls seeking comment, but a Comsat 
spokeswoman said she did not expect layoffs at RSI. 

Comsat bought RSI for $ 150 million in stock in February 1994, when it was 
called Radiation Systems Inc. RSI had $ 10 million in annual profit, $ 120 
million in sales and had just won an $ 18 million contract to furnish three 
satellite systems to Kuwait. 

Bruce Crockett, Comsat's chairman at the time, predicted the unit would have 
sales of $ 400 million to $ 500 million by 1997. 

But RSI fell far short of those goals. Comsat declined to release specific 
figures but said that RSI in 1997 accounted for "the majority" of $ 300 million 
in revenue from its technology services unit, which includes Comsat's 
laboratories. 

Crockett's replacement as president and chief executive, Betty Alewine, put RSI 
up for sale last March as part of her strategy to focus on Comsat's core 
business of providing satellite communications services. In June, Comsat 
declared RSI a discontinued operation, and the company took a $ 60 million 
write-off last year. 

"It's good to get this non-core, difficult operation out of the way," said 
George Reed Dellinger, a telecommunications analyst for HSBC Washington 
Analysis. "Unfortunately, this probably was not a good fit" with Comsat. 

The sale price is subject to adjustment based on loans and advances between 
Comsat Corp. and RSI at the time the deal closes, Comsat officials said. Comsat 
will use sale proceeds to pay off short-term debt. 

Comsat agreed to keep two divisions of RSI, called Electromechanical Systems 
Inc. and Plexsys International Corp. Comsat also will keep a long-term 
construction contract for a radio telescope in Green Bank, W. Va. 

The company in late February sold another RSI subsidiary, JEFA Wireless Systems, 
to Able Telecom Holding Corp. for an undisclosed amount. 

Comsat shares closed yesterday at $ 34.75, up 31 1/4 cents. 

The sale marks the last major piece of Alewine's plan to divest Comsat of 
extraneous businesses. The company last year spun off its 80 percent ownership 
stake in Ascent Entertainment Group, which owns a film studio and two 
professional sports teams in Denver. 

The company now focuses on providing satellite services to customers as the 
largest owner and user of the Intelsat and Inmarsat satellite consortia, and on 
building digital communications networks -- using land- and space-based 
equipment -- for businesses overseas. 

Comsat's next challenge is to fend off legislation pending in Congress that 
calls for a quicker and more extensive privatization of Intelsat than the treaty 
organization is on the verge of approving. Comsat calls the legislation punitive 
because if the congressional schedule is not met it would allow Comsat's U.S. 
customers to have direct access to Intelsat services and could restrict Comsat 
from providing some new services it already offers, including Internet access.
