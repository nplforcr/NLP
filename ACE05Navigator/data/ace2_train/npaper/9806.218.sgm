Walt Disney Co. is negotiating to buy WJLA (Channel 7) in Washington and seven 
other TV stations across the country owned by broadcasting and banking magnate 
Joe L. Allbritton, sources said yesterday. 

If the negotiations are successful, Disney-owned ABC would take over management 
of WJLA, the local ABC affiliate, and establish it as the Washington base for 
the network, which already owns stations in 10 other major cities including New 
York, Chicago and Los Angeles. Allbritton Communications' stations could fetch $ 
750 million to $ 900 million, according to rough valuations by industry sources. 


"Yeah, we're interested," said an ABC executive who did not want to be 
identified. The executive said ABC does not publicly discuss possible 
acquisitions. 

Disney, like other broadcasting networks, is eager to buy local stations, which 
are the most profitable part of the television business. The ABC network is 
ailing and anticipates losses this year, though such losses are more than offset 
by strong profits of the local stations ABC owns and operates. Allbritton's TV 
empire is attractive because it is one of the few remaining groups of ABC 
affiliates that Disney could purchase. 

Federal deregulation of the broadcasting business in 1996 raised limits on the 
number of stations that a single company can own. It set off a buying frenzy, 
which has driven the price of television stations to record levels. 

Allbritton, 72, owns Allbritton Communications Corp. and has a controlling 
interest in Riggs National Corp. of Washington, the parent company of Riggs 
Bank. He has been approached repeatedly about selling the bank, but has rejected 
the offers. 

Price could be the crucial factor in negotiations for the television stations. 
Both Disney and Allbritton are known as hard bargainers. 

Allbritton and his son, Robert, 28, chief operating officer of Allbritton 
Communications, were in London yesterday for the annual shareholders meeting of 
Riggs AP Bank, a British affiliate of Riggs National Bank, and could not be 
reached for comment. 

Jerald Fritz, general counsel of Allbritton Communications, said the company 
does not comment on rumors or media reports. 

Through a separate company, Allbritton also owns Newschannel 8, the Washington 
all-news cable channel. Industry sources said Newschannel 8, a six-year-old 
local station that has yet to turn a profit, is included in the package Disney 
is negotiating to buy. 

Allbritton Communications owns six other ABC affiliates, in Lynchburg, Va.; 
Tulsa, Okla.; Harrisburg, Pa.; Charleston, S.C.; Tuscaloosa, Ala.; and Little 
Rock. It owns a low-power station in Alabama and manages another station that 
serves the Tuscaloosa-Birmingham market. 

WJLA -- which stands for Joe L. Allbritton -- is the big prize in Allbritton's 
empire, accounting for half the $ 173 million in revenue the company reported 
last year. The stations generated almost $ 62.8 million in operating cash flow 
last year, and reported a loss of $ 3 million for the six months ended March 31. 


Industry analysts say cash flow is a better measure of a TV station's 
performance than profits and is the factor used to determine prices. Stations 
recently have been selling for 12 to 15 times annual cash flow, which would 
place the value of Allbritton Communications' stations in the $ 750 million to $ 
900 million range. 

Washington has been a relatively poor market for ABC, primarily because WJLA's 
lagging local newscast has had poor ratings, which have translated into smaller 
audiences and advertising rates for the network's shows. ABC counts on local 
news as a "lead-in" for its "World News Tonight With Peter Jennings" and other 
programming. 

WJLA's 5 p.m. newscast, anchored by Paul Berry and Kathleen Mathews, finished 
third in the ratings during the May "sweeps," despite being preceded by Oprah 
Winfrey's hugely popular talk show. Its 6 p.m. news also ranked third, behind 
WRC (Channel 4) and WUSA (Channel 9), and was tied for second at 11 p.m. with 
WUSA, although both were a distant second to WRC at that hour. 

If it purchases the station, ABC would likely beef up WJLA's local news 
operation to bolster ratings for the network news. 

ABC owns stations in 10 cities, covering about 25 percent of the nation's 
population, leaving it well below the federal ownership limit of 35 percent of 
the population.
