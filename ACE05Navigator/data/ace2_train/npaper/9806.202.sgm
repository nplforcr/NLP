The American Medical Association voted yesterday to install the heir apparent as 
its president-elect, rejecting a strong, upstart challenge by a District doctor 
who argued that the nation's largest physicians' group needs stronger ethics and 
new leadership. 

In electing Thomas R. Reardon, an Oregon general practitioner who had been the 
chairman of its board, members signified they did not hold him responsible for a 
costly gaffe last year, when the group agreed to endorse a line of Sunbeam Corp. 
health care products. Reardon had become chairman just before the signing of the 
Sunbeam deal, which would have funneled millions of dollars to the AMA but 
violated its prohibition against letting its name be used for commercial 
purposes. 

Throughout the year and at the association's annual meeting in Chicago this 
week, the episode heightened dissent within the organization, the 
largest-spending lobbying group in the country, which already has been weakened 
by a substantial decline in membership and the medical profession's diminished 
clout in an era of managed care. 

Reardon said yesterday that his election is evidence that physicians are eager 
to put last year's troubles behind them. 

In an interview, Reardon said he plans to focus on trying to persuade Congress 
to enact legislation to give doctors and patients more power against health 
maintenance organizations and other types of managed care. He said the AMA also 
will emphasize a patient-safety initiative, an effort to teach doctors to 
provide better help to dying patients and their families, and an attempt to make 
sure the federal government does not punish doctors for simple billing mistakes 
in its efforts to crack down on Medicare fraud. 

Reardon said he will work to rebuild AMA membership, which has slipped to the 
point that less than 40 percent of the nation's doctors now belong. 

But Raymond Scalettar, the Washington rheumatologist who announced that he would 
oppose Reardon just two weeks ago, said yesterday's 270 to 196 vote reflects a 
reservoir of discontent within the organization. "It is clearly a message . . . 
that the leadership of the American Medical Association has to be really on its 
toes for the future," said Scalettar, who was the AMA's board chairman five 
years ago. 

Scalettar's candidacy marked the first time in 25 years that someone decided at 
the last minute to mount an insurgent challenge to what usually is a 
well-choreographed succession to the presidency of the 295,000-member 
organization. Reardon now becomes the president-elect, and will begin a one-year 
term as president next year. Yesterday, Nancy Dickey of Texas became the AMA's 
first female president. 

Many doctors at this week's meetings said they think the organization needs to 
move beyond the recent controversy. 

"The physicians back home aren't interested in Sunbeam," said Robert Weierman, 
an orthopedic surgeon from South Orange, N.J., who is one of the AMA's 495 
voting delegates. "Reimbursement problems and the slowdown in payments are the 
main issues where I come from." 

But others said the Sunbeam matter will continue to haunt the association, 
particularly since the corporation has sued the AMA for $ 20 million. "The 
financial cost to the AMA is the least of it," one physician said at a forum on 
the matter. "The real cost is loss of prestige, the embarrassment we had, the 
realization our ship was not on course.'
