American Mobile Satellite Corp. announced yesterday that it will purchase 
Motorola Inc.'s electronic-messaging business, known as Ardis, for $ 100 million 
in stock and cash, a move that would make the Reston company one of the 
country's largest suppliers of mobile data-service devices to professionals who 
are frequently out of their offices but need to stay in touch with dispatchers 
and managers. 

The acquisition combines two companies with complementary technologies that now 
serve disparate business sectors. Under terms of the deal, Motorola would become 
AMSC's second-largest stockholder, with close to 20 percent of the company, said 
Gary Parsons, president and chief executive of AMSC. 

Ardis, which covers more than 425 cities in North America, uses radio towers to 
provide data messages to mobile business users -- for example, copy machine or 
elevator repair people. AMSC, meanwhile, uses satellites to provide both voice 
and data message services to people who work in outlying areas, including truck 
drivers and boat captains. 

The acquisition is contingent on government regulatory approvals and is expected 
to close in the first quarter of this year. If the deal is approved, AMSC said 
its emphasis would shift to data, rather than voice, services. AMSC anticipates 
that more than 80 percent of its revenue would come from data services, and 
close to 90 percent of its customer base would use such services. The split is 
now about 50-50, Parsons said. 

"This seems like a good strategic fit for AMSC in that it will give them 
ubiquitous service," said Robert Kaimowitz, a satellite industry analyst for 
C.E. Unterberg, Towbin in New York. But Kaimowitz declined to comment on whether 
he believes AMSC is paying a good price for Ardis, which he projects will have 
revenue of about $ 38 million in 1997. The deal's impact on AMSC's earnings is 
unclear, he said. AMSC has lost money consistently in recent quarters, reporting 
losses of $ 80.2 million in the first three quarters of 1997, on revenue of $ 
30.3 million. 

AMSC stock closed yesterday at $ 7 a share, up 6 1/4 cents, on the Nasdaq Stock 
Market. Motorola's stock also was up 6 1/4 cents a share to close at $ 57.18 3/4 
on the New York Stock Exchange. 

Yesterday's announcement solidifies what had already been a close working 
relationship between the two companies, Parsons said. He said the companies had 
relied on each other's technology when users moved out of their normal coverage 
area. 

From a consumer standpoint, nothing would change in the new arrangement, Parsons 
said. No new equipment would be needed. While he said the acquisition would 
allow AMSC to reduce costs, he expects no decrease in the prices of products. He 
said it is premature to say what management or branding changes would be made. 
Ardis's land-based division would continue working at the company's 
Lincolnshire, Ill., headquarters, he said, with its satellite services based in 
Reston; there are no plans for any layoffs. 

Albert Lopez, director of communications for Motorola's messaging information 
and media sector, said the acquisition would enable the company to focus on 
developing consumer products, including cellular phones and pagers. 

"These are the things Motorola is known for," he said.
