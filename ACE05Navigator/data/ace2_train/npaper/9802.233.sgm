The head of the International Monetary Fund wrote a private letter to 
Indonesia's President Suharto threatening to cut off bailout money because of a 
dispute over economic policy, raising the prospect that the international effort 
to stem Asia's financial crisis could come unglued. 

President Clinton called Suharto last night to reinforce the IMF position in the 
dispute, administration officials said yesterday. 

The confrontation between the Indonesian president and his would-be rescuers 
came as Indonesia's crisis deepened across both economic and political lines. 
The Indonesian rupiah, which had been climbing, plunged as much as 24 percent 
against the U.S. dollar. And the country suffered one of the worst outbreaks of 
violence since the onset of its economic troubles, with thousands of rioters in 
four towns looting and burning shops in protest over rising food prices.

The letter from IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus, which was dated 
Wednesday and obtained by The Washington Post, came in response to evidence that 
Suharto is planning to change Indonesia's monetary system radically, adopting a 
Hong Kong-style "currency board" in which the value of the rupiah would be 
rigidly fixed against the dollar and the Indonesian authorities essentially 
would abandon control over interest rates. The IMF staff, backed by the U.S. 
Treasury and economic officials in other major countries, believes that 
Indonesia is at present incapable of credibly sustaining such a fixed exchange 
rate. Camdessus wrote that if Jakarta implemented the move anytime soon, he 
would urge the board of the 182-nation organization to suspend the $ 43 billion 
bailout of Indonesia's economy. 

The imbroglio over the seemingly arcane currency issue threatens to plunge 
Indonesia -- and possibly its neighbors as well -- into a renewed bout of 
financial turmoil, analysts said. 

The stock markets and currencies of Indonesia and several other ailing Asian 
countries, including South Korea, Thailand and Malaysia, have recovered some of 
their losses in recent weeks. The growing sense of stability raised hope in 
financial capitals and official circles that the worst of the region's financial 
problems may have passed following the commitment of more than $ 100 billion in 
loans from the IMF, World Bank and wealthy nations to the region. 

But Indonesia, the world's fourth-most-populous country, is widely viewed by 
analysts and officials alike as the nation most likely to drag the region back 
into crisis. The rupiah, which fell as much as 80 percent from its value last 
summer, remains severely depressed, making imports hugely expensive -- so much 
so that many manufacturing companies cannot afford to import the raw materials 
they need. 

And amid increased incidents of rioting in recent weeks, fears are rising that 
the country could become engulfed by social unrest and attacks by majority 
Muslims against the ethnic Chinese minority that might undermine stability 
throughout Asia. 

Warning that Indonesia's problems could spread quickly, the governor of the 
country's central bank, Soedradjad Djiwandono, was quoted as saying in wire 
service reports yesterday that "contagion effects can be rapid, overwhelming and 
costly even to countries that have maintained consistently sound economic 
policies." 

The rupiah's slide, to as low as 9,600 per dollar from 7,300 per dollar 
yesterday, drove other Southeast Asian currencies downward, including the Thai 
baht and the Malaysian ringgit, although the other currencies later rose as the 
rupiah recovered to about 8,600 per dollar. 

Fueling the currency drops were reports that the clash between Suharto and the 
IMF was intensifying over the currency board issue, which aroused fears that 
Indonesia would lose international backing that it badly needs to restore 
investor confidence. 

Suharto has made it clear that he favors a currency board plan championed by a 
Johns Hopkins University professor, Steve H. Hanke, to fix the exchange rate 
permanently at about 5,000 rupiah per dollar. 

Under a currency board, a country's monetary authorities essentially pledge to 
put stability in the exchange rate above all other objectives, including 
economic growth, cheap credit and employment. They maintain a large reserve of 
dollars available to exchange the local currency at the fixed rate, and promise 
not to print more money without adding to their reserve of dollars. 

Among the most successful examples of currency boards is Argentina's, which 
eliminated hyperinflation after implementing the approach in 1991, although the 
Buenos Aires regime has suffered through periods of very high interest rates and 
recession to maintain its fixed rate of one peso per dollar. 

Contacted by phone in Jakarta where he arrived yesterday to meet with Suharto, 
Hanke blasted the Clinton administration and the IMF for trying to torpedo his 
idea. He noted that the rupiah had staged a powerful rally earlier this week as 
news emerged that a currency board might soon be introduced -- and that its 
partial recovery from Friday's tailspin came after he announced at a news 
conference that Suharto plans to press ahead with a board. 

"We're completely puzzled as to why the Clinton administration and the IMF seems 
intent on destabilizing the currency and the country," Hanke said. "All the 
other currencies in the region are going up and down with the rupiah. So they 
[the administration and the IMF] are destabilizing the whole region. If this 
currency board doesn't go ahead, we're going to have total meltdown." 

But in Washington, the IMF was issuing its strongest public criticism to date of 
Jakarta's proposed adoption of a currency board, and a special IMF 
representative, Prabhakar Narvekar, met with Suharto in an effort to dissuade 
him, according to wire service reports. 

In a speech, Camdessus said he was of "the strong view" that the time for a 
fixed currency in Indonesia "has not yet come," because "a number of 
preconditions have to be satisfied." Among these, he said, was the need for 
Jakarta to obtain substantial reserves of dollars and strengthen the country's 
battered banking system. If Indonesia fixed its exchange rate without holding 
more dollars in reserve, it would invite speculators to attack the rupiah, the 
IMF believes, and Indonesia's cash-strapped banks might collapse if the 
authorities gave up their ability to print money. 

Camdessus and Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers declined to answer 
reporters' questions yesterday about whether the IMF would cut off funding to 
Indonesia. 

In his letter, however, Camdessus wrote: "In the present circumstances . . . if 
a currency board proposal were adopted, we would not be able to recommend to the 
IMF Board the continuation of the present program because of the risks to the 
Indonesian economy. This would be a very unfortunate development, as it would 
shrink even further the reserve basis for the currency board and further 
undermine its very slim chances of success." 

Camdessus said the IMF might favor a currency board for Indonesia once the 
necessary conditions are met. Hanke retorted that in his opinion, Indonesia 
already has met the necessary conditions, and he said he doesn't believe Suharto 
will capitulate to IMF pressure.
