<ANNOTATION> Reporter: </ANNOTATION>
In a three-hour ceremony this morning, the Pope declared 2000
will be a holy year.
During that year, Catholics will be ablto earn indulgences by doing good
works.
An indulgence eliminates punishment for sin, speeding entry into heaven.
In the 16th century, indulgences got a bad name, because the church sold
them.
They were part of the reason Martin Luther broke away and formed the
protestant church.
But theologians say the 21st century indulgence is different.

An indulgence in the way he's using it, is not as a means for gathering
money for the church, but rather as a means of enhancing your soul.
According to the papal edict, Catholics can earn indulgences by giving up
cigarettes or alcohol for a day, or by visiting someone in prison or in the
hospital.
