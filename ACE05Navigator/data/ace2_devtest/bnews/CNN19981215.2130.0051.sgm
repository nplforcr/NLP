More details coming in on a report prepared for the U.N. security
council by Richard Butler.
Mr. Butler concludes in his report that there has been far short of
compliance by Iraq for his inspectors in the field.
This is important because it could set the launching point for possible
U.S. military action.
In the report, Butler says Iraq's conduct ensured that no progress was able
to be made in the fields of disarmament or accounting for Iraq's prohibited
weapons.
Iraq has blocked the inspectors several times.
