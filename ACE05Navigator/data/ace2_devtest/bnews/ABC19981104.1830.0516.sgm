George W. bush has an impressive victory.
Before the night was out, some republicans were practically anointing him
as their presidential candidate two years from now.
ABC's dean Reynolds reports from Texas.

<TURN>
Thank you, MA'am.

And bush has a network of well-healed contributors who helped to
bankroll a media campaign as slick as most races for the White House.
His appeal to democrats, especially Hispanics is a big political plus.

While the governor opposes abortion and favors the death penalty
and school prayer, he doesn't sound strident.
<TURN>
I don't think he's the favorite of the evangelical right of the republican
party.
But initially, he appears to be at least acceptable.
And that's absolutely critical.
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> Reporter: </ANNOTATION>
And being from a famous family doesn't hurt.
<TURN>
She helps a lot.
<TURN>
No, I do not.
<TURN>
Of course, you do.

<ANNOTATION> Reporter: </ANNOTATION>
He clearly loves campaigning, but he has said repeatedly that he
is reluctant to put his family through what he calls the Washington
political meat grinder.
And that has led to speculation that George W. bush lacks the requisite
fire in the belly to make a race for the White House.
Then there are the questions about the governor's admittedly irresponsible
behavior as a young adult.
<TURN>
It all started because somebody discovered I quit drinking.
And somebody said, well, why did you quit drinking?
And I said, because I was drinking too much.
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> Reporter: </ANNOTATION>
This being the '90s, bush has had to assure people that he's been
faithful to his wife Laura.
<TURN>
If there was something in my closet that would disqualify me from a run,
you'd know about it.
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> Reporter: </ANNOTATION>
He says he will concentrate on being governor for the next few
months before deciding what to do about 2000.
Whatever the decision, there's no question a lot of people will be waiting
to hear what it is.
Dean Reynolds, ABC News, Laredo, Texas.
