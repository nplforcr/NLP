So far President Cardozo has made no public statement about the election.
However, there is no longer any doubt about the outcome. Mr. Cardozo will
become the first Brazilian president to be reelected to a second successive
term. Meanwhile, the coalition of left wing parties which supported the
president's main challenger, Louis Inagnio Denanasova have issued a
statement attacking both the government and the media for allegedly trying
to manipulate the campaign. Mr. Cardozo will now want to push ahead with
his austerity plans. None of this will be easy since he will need the
support of Congress and of the country's powerful state governors. Steven
Speech, BBC News, Sao Paulo.
