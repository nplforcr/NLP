The `94th World Series opens tomorrow in New York with the favored Yankees
taking on the upstart San Diego Padres. But you can bet a stack of baseball
trading cards that New Yorkers and San Diegoans aren't the only fans with a
rooting interest. In Tokyo, American journalist Ken Belsan says that the
baseball-loving Japanese might be a little late for work during the series.

All the American finales, the World Series, the NBA finals, the Super Bowl,
for sure, get covered on cable TV, usually live. In the World Series case,
it'll be about six, seven in the morning on satellite TV here. And most
people will be watching it. If you're a sports fan, you'll watch American
baseball.

The Japanese fans will actually get a double dose of baseball because their
own world series starts tomorrow, too. The match-up will see the favored
Sable Lions going up against the Yokohoma -based Stars. Ken Belsan says
that while many Japanese will be pulling for the underdog-based Stars,
they're not inclined to pull for the upstart Padres.

Most Japanese look to America as the standard for most things, and
certainly in sports, they root for the Michael Jordans and the Dallas
Cowboys. And I think in this case, they'll probably look at the Yankees as
the team that's quintessentially American. Most Japanese, certainly the
older generation, think of Americans and America as Cadillacs, Elvis,
canned beer and big steaks. And the Yankees, of course, fit into that
motto, I think.
