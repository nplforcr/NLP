Tonight we have with us two members of Congress who took part in today's
historic vote to hold open-ended impeachment hearings.
Representative is aia hutch I son is a republican from Arkansas and a
member of the house Judiciary committee.
He's with us tonight from Capitol Hill.
Also with us from Washington, Dennis Kucinich, a democratic feshman from
Ohio whose vote came as a surprise to some.
Congressman Kucinich, your vote did come as a surprise because you're not
in any sort of tight election race.
Your district is solidly democratic so why did you vote the way you did?
<TURN>
I think the whole nation gets to get above this and beyond it and the only
way to do that is to have open hearings.
People want to make sure the truth is brought out, so bring the truth
forward and then let's get beyond it.
There are so many important matters to address in this country and the
world but we can't do it until we definitively dismiss this case, and we
can't dismiss it without having hearings.
<TURN>
But there is a question of open-endedness and there's no --
<TURN>
This hearing will end with this Congress.
Congress would then have to reauthorize it and I think it would be very
difficult if Congress is not successful in moving things forward with
dispatch, because the fact of the matter is the American people want it
done with, but they want closure.
They don't want a cover-up and the only way we can really do justice to the
nation and to the president is to make sure that the facts are brought
forward.
Let the accusers present their case.
They've never been subject to cross-examination.
Give the President a chance to clear himself, and let's get above this and
then beyond it.
<TURN>
Congressman Hutchinson, do you believe that is the way to go?
<TURN>
I believe the congressman stated it very well and I admire him for what he
did today.
I think the fact there were 31 democrats that supported the resolution that
was presented shows that this is -- there's bipartisan support for this
inquiry and even those who did not support the Hyde proposal, they
supported the idea of an inquiry.
Minority leader Gephardt indicated there is consensus in this body that we
need to have an inquiry.
There was some dispute as to the procedures of it, but I think we're ready
to go forward and bring a conclusion to this matter.
<TURN>
Now Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Kucinich was only one of 31 democrats who defected.
That was far short of some of the estimates we heard which were up to 100.
That is not exactly a resounding victory for republicans, is it?
<TURN>
I don't think we're looking at it whether it's a republican victory or not.
I think what's important is the American people look behind just a vote and
see there was a clear consensus on a bipartisan basis for a number of
things today.
One, that we should have an inquiry.
Secondly, that this is a serious matter.
Thirdly, that it's a vote of conscience, and fourthly that we want to get
this over with.
Clearly that had broad support today.
Now it broke down a little bit on the fine points, but that was broadly
supported.
The American people I think can see there's something to build on, that we
can move forward, and I hope that the bipartisanship will increase as time
goes on.
<TURN>
Congressman Kucinich, let's get back to your vote.
There were some who said there was exceeding pressure from the White House,
even the first lady on democratic members of Congress to support the
president on this.
What contact did you have?
Did anyone try to lobby you?
<TURN>
None.
None whatsoever.
And people ought to know that.
This is one member who didn't receive a single call from the White House.
No one asked me for my vote or asked me how I was going to vote.
I was able to cast a vote based on the way that I felt -- things ought to
move forward and it's not done not as an attack on the president because
there are plenty of supporters of the president that voted to have
hearings.
It was done to give this country a chance to move forward and finally get
some closure.
If we continue the debate as to whether we should have hearings, then we'll
never get to -- an opportunity to review the facts in the Starr report in
an open hearing.
That's what I think we need to do, but we can't do it in a way that it just
keeps dragging on and on.
The American people expect this thing to be wrapped up and if there's
enough facts to review, let the committee move forward and let's get on
with the rest of the business of the country.
<TURN>
Do you personally think that what the -- what the president is alleged to
have done rises to the level of impeachable offenses, even to Washington
removal from office?
<TURN>
Well, that's why we're going to have hearings.
If you don't have hearings, you can't make that determination.
I mean, based on what's in the Starr report, I think they're going to need
a lot more than that.
Need to have the report brought forth.
Linda Tripp needs to be brought before the committee.
I mean, that's -- I voted for hearings to make sure that the truth was out.
Let's shine some light on all this and give the American people a chance to
settle it once and for all.
But there is no closure, if you just skip over the whole idea of hearings.
There was going to be hearings.
There was no question there was going to be an inquiry.
I say let's move forward with it and let's get on with the business of the
country.
Today your reports talk about the stock market up and down, world economy
is in a mess, problems in Kosovo with people dying, freezing out there in
the forest.
Those are problems that are serious.
We don't know yet how serious the problems are before that committee.
But we know that we better get that committee hearing over and then address
the rest of the world's problems.
<TURN>
OK, congressman Hutchinson, if we are to in congressman Kucinich's words,
to settle this once and for all, should the president have to go up to
Capitol Hill and testify?
<TURN>
It's the president's conduct that's at issue.
Very serious charges of obstruction of justice, witness-tampering, and
there's a dispute in the evidence, the president has denied these
allegations.
And if he desires to come to Capitol Hill and testify, I'm sure that
opportunity would be afforded to him.
I don't think we should subpoena him and I don't believe we should request
him to out of deaf reference to the president but if he wants to present
his defense accident he'll have opportunity to do that.
<TURN>
If I may respond to what he just said, I think anytime President Clinton
has had a chance to bring his case forward, he's also done so well and
successfully.
Any time new information has been brought out, it's generally been helpful
to the White House, so I think these hearings could produce an opportunity
for the White House to clear itself.
<TURN>
All right, gentlemen, I believe we will have to leave it there.
Thank you very much, representative Hutchinson and representative Kucinich.
