U.S. officials say Washington will not respond with force to isolated acts
of defiance by Iraq to U.N. inspectors.
The latest violations are a more immediate cause for concern at the United
Nations.

Seven groups of U.N. weapons inspectors set out this morning to
conduct surprise searches.
The search that the Iraqis resisted was of an office of Iraq's ruling baath
party.
Baghdad says it was all an honest mistake, that the Iraqi official assigned
to accompany the inspectors mistakenly thought that building was a
So-called "sensitive site," so he limited the number of inspectors allowed
in -- a condition UNSCOM would not agree to.
<TURN>
They wanted to enter the site.
The Iraqi personnel accompanying them at that time, it was their judgment
that this was a sensitive site.
Really, it was not.

Iraqi officials say that Wednesday's incident stems from UNSCOM's
reluctance to adhere to the ground rules worked out between Baghdad and
unscom in 1996.
Those rules, say Baghdad, include limits on the number of inspectors
allowed into sites Iraq calls sensitive, such as areas housing Iraqi
security.
<TURN>
Unless this is resolved, there will be definitely potentialities for a
Crisis, confrontation.

UNSCOM chief weapons inspector Richard Butler said he considered
wednesday's event very serious but was withholding judgment on whether Iraq
was or was not cooperating with U.N. inspectors.
<TURN>
I have made clear to the security council that I won't give my report to
the secretary general of the United Nations, whether or not Iraq is
cooperating, until we have done all our work, of which this inspection was
one part.
And we've got a few more to come.
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> Reporter: </ANNOTATION>
Based on that the, security council will decide whether a full
review of sanctions on Iraq can take place the first step, Baghdad hopes,
of lit lifting the embargo on the country.
