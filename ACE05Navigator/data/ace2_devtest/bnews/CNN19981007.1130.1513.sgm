Always an intellectual, designer Sonia rykiel celebrates 30 years
in fashion with a show at the new, modern library in Paris.
And rykiel doesn't disappoint.
She does exaggerated cardigans, long skirts, full pants, curvaceous
sweaters, colorful striped tops, and easy jackets.

The place like that, the place needs something fantastic, something magic.
The girls have to be magic, the clothes have to be magic, the music has to
be magic.
You can't use a place like that if you are not about to have a space like
that.

way, in a social way.
