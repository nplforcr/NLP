frank : proceedings about to get under way in 40 minutes from now . we welcome michael gerhardt joins us throughout . mike and i , seen joined by jeff greenfield . folks let 's talk about the bipartisan we heard talk about . in the end if this comes down to a straight party vote , the president would n't be convicted and there would n't be bipartisanship . in the end as we saw with andrew johnson there were radical republicans who saved the party by one vote . what has to happen to get to that model again . i think as you pointed out radical republicans broke with the party and voted to acquit president johnson was a defining moment for that event . that helps us understand that particular event . but i think something dramatic , something different , new is going to have to happen here , that would probably lead to a greater sort of bipartisanship than we have seen thus far . my own feeling is that a party line vote will be seen as just that . and therefore , i 'm trying to picture what happens after a certain stage in this trial . for instance , after the presentation and prewitness one could imagine 6 republicans the northeast moderates we 've heard so much about saying enough already and voting to adjourn the trial . the converse , the idea of democrats breaking with the president to convict . you almost ca n't imagine that happening without witnesses showing up and saying something or behaving with demeanor in such a way that democrats who are disposed to vote with the president suddenly say uo something worse happened . the republican move earlier to adjourn and the democratic drift to break with the president . jeanne : michael let me ask you about expectations for today . how will this be like a conventional trial , how will it be dissimilar . very dissimilar . it 's helpful . this is different in many respects . you have the chief justice presiding over this proceeding , he does n't proceed over trial-like proceedings . you have the senators mute . they are acting as more man just jurors . this is their proceeding , they are in control of the the direction of this proceeding . they can end it or prolong it at any point . that makes this very different . moreover , the house managers and the had thes lawyers will be constrained in a certain respect with what they can present . they will be able to present things only to the extent the senators allow them to present those things this will have a different dynamic . frank : michael gerhardt we 'll be back to you . jeff greenfield .
