in the united states , an organization known as the feminist majority has launched a campaign on behalf of women in afghanistan that it alleges are mistreated by the ruling taliban . mavis leno is a member of the organization 's board and the wife of the popular television comedian jay leno . she spoke with voa 's tom crosby and told him that for her , it was the right time to take up the cause of the women in that country . spkr : mavis_leno a lot of things that i was interested in and felt strongly about coalesced at one time . i had joined the feminist majority because i wanted to basically make sure of three things . i wanted to make sure that the advances women have made in america in this century do n't roll back , as they have before . i want to make sure that a new generation of feminist-oriented young women grow up with help from those of us who were in the front lines in the '70s . and the feminist majority handles both those issues . and i also had felt for a long time that american women were in a strong enough position now to look to women in third world countries and offer them a helping hand . and so when i heard what was going on in afghanistan , which i first learned about when i joined the board of the feminist majority , everything fell into place . spkr : tom_crosby once you got involved in this , did you get any response from the people of afghanistan themselves ? spkr : leno it 's very difficult to get response from the people inside afghanistan because the taliban have cut off pretty much all the means by which people could communicate . they do n't allow tv , they do n't allow foreign observers in . they really -- if they did n't need money so badly , which they do , they probably would do what albania did and just completely sever their links with the rest of the world . however , i have spoken to many , many people who are emigres from afghanistan and are trying desperately to do something about the plight of their country , and a lot of people that i 've spoken to work with the women in the refugee camps who fled afghanistan after the takeover and are now living in camps in pakistan . and these people honestly feel , these women , that america , the west , is their last chance . one woman said in the course of the -- a highly illegal interview that she gave -- anonymously , of course -- that the women of afghanistan are the walking dead . so unless we can get them out , there 's very little chance for them to be gotten out . spkr : westpheling mavis leno of the feminist majority . she talked with voa 's tom crosby .
