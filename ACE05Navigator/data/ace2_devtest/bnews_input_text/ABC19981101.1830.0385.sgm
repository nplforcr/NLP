president clinton is not running in tuesday 's election , but he 's a factor in nearly every race . we asked political reporters and analysts from around the country about the races to watch . this clinton business has really helped both parties . hard core republicans and social conservatives are angry at president clinton over this , and hard core democrats and liberals are angry at congress over this . in illinois , carol moseley braun is in trouble . she 's had a number of ethical issues in her performance in office . sometimes when you become the issue in a campaign , it 's awful hard to change the subject . one of the big stories in the northeast is voter turnout this year . in massachusetts , for example , the secretary of state has predicted we 're going to have the lowest turnout since world war ii in terms of percentage . the senate race pits senator alfonse d'amato , republican , against congressman chuck schumer . it 's the first time d'amato has an opponent who could beat him and that has enormous repercussion for the senate . i think the single most important race out west , anywhere in the country , most would agree , is the race for california governor . you have democratic governor gray davis running quite far ahead in the polls against republican attorney general dan lungren . the governor , who is elected on tuesday , will preside over reapportionment , the once every decade redrawing of political boundaries . so for that reason alone , california governor 's race is going to have a very important and significant impact on the house well into the next decade . i think the election of the bush brothers tuesday night will probably be the most important signal coming out of the south . george w. bush appears to be winning in texas . if he wins big , that 's going to be an impressive victory and put him up for the republican nomination in 2000 . if his brother , jeb bush , can win also in florida , then republicans will come in control of the two largest states in the south . and i think that would be the major political event occurring in the south .
