as many young athletes strive to reach the pinnacle of their sport , their parents often are a source of strength , a refuge in a competitive world . but sometimes , parents go too far . joan ryan , a columnist for `` the san francisco chronicle , '' wrote a book called `` little girls in pretty boxes : the making and breaking of elite gymnasts and figure skaters . '' tonight , joan ryan , `` in her own words . '' in gymnastics , figure skating , tennis , these sports in which young girls can be the best in the world at a young age , the parents shift somehow and become the exploiters . somewhere along the line the girl 's inner drive gets shifted to the parents and the parents take hold of this dream . what started out as fun and just a love for this sport becomes a job for these girls . they understand that their parents have not really been behaving as parents . they have n't been the protectors and the nurturers that we expect of parents . they are putting in 35 to 50 hours a week at the ages of 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 years old . it 's a job and child labor laws should apply . what i hope is that a kid can go to their parent and say , `` i 'm feeling like this is more important to you than it is to me . i 'm feeling like you 've co-opted my dream . '' and so i 'm hoping that what dominique does will have a ripple effect for a lot of kids . author joan ryan tonight , `` in her own words . ''
