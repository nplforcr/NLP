now our regular report on how the government sometimes misuses your money . historically , black colleges have received federal funding to further their mission of educating young black americans . so , what happens when a black college is no longer black ? here 's abc 's michelle norris . reporter : this is bluefield state college , one of the nation 's 105 historically black colleges -- or is it ? when i go to class , i 'm the only black and female in the class . till i came here , i did n't even know it was an historically black college . reporter : at bluefield it 's not just a problem of appearance . historically , black colleges automatically qualify for federal funds that are meant to help needy black students . that was once the mission at bluefield state , but times have changed . today there are few visible signs that the school once served an all-black population . and yet the school continues to receive more than $ 1 million a year in federal funding earmarked for black institutions of higher learning , even though the school is now 93 % white . of the school 's 2,300 students , about 200 are african-american . if you look around , there 's not a lot of blacks , there 's not a lot of black staff . reporter : in fact , only 2 of the school 's 80 faculty members are black . and how do we define culture ? reporter : and both were hired just this fall . one professor has sued bluefield state for collecting millions of dollars of your money , even though the school is a black college in name only . maybe legally they do , but , you know , i do n't think morally they have a right to those funds . reporter : even the federal government admits there is a problem . there is a legitimate and serious question about whether they deserve to continue to receive that funding . reporter : but that has n't stopped the government from doling out handouts and it has n't stopped the school from accepting the cash . there 's a limited pool of money . yes . reporter : so if you 're getting $ 1 million , that 's $ 1 million that someone else is not getting . but i 'm not making that decision on the thing . i 'm just putting through the proposal . as an institution , we seek out those things that we are eligible for . reporter : whether or not the school remains eligible is a question that only congress can resolve . but until that happens , this historically black , yet predominantly white college , will continue collecting $ 1 million of your money each year . michele norris , abc news , bluefield , west virginia .
