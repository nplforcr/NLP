the ` 94th world series opens tomorrow in new york with the favored yankees taking on the upstart san diego padres . but you can bet a stack of baseball trading cards that new yorkers and san diegoans are n't the only fans with a rooting interest . in tokyo , american journalist ken belsan says that the baseball-loving japanese might be a little late for work during the series . spkr : ken_belsan all the american finales , the world series , the nba finals , the super bowl , for sure , get covered on cable tv , usually live . in the world series case , it 'll be about six , seven in the morning on satellite tv here . and most people will be watching it . if you 're a sports fan , you 'll watch american baseball . spkr : cahn the japanese fans will actually get a double dose of baseball because their own world series starts tomorrow , too . the match-up will see the favored sable lions going up against the yokohoma - based stars . ken belsan says that while many japanese will be pulling for the underdog-based stars , they 're not inclined to pull for the upstart padres . spkr : belsan most japanese look to america as the standard for most things , and certainly in sports , they root for the michael jordans and the dallas cowboys . and i think in this case , they 'll probably look at the yankees as the team that 's quintessentially american . most japanese , certainly the older generation , think of americans and america as cadillacs , elvis , canned beer and big steaks . and the yankees , of course , fit into that motto , i think .
