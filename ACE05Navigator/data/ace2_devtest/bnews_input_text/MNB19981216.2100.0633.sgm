let 's go to the north lawn of the white house . claire shipman standing by now . the subject of a lot of activity late today , claire . what can you tell us to update us tonight ? one thing we 're seeing tonight with these military strikes and what we 've heard from all of the briefings we 've been listening to tonight from the president 's foreign policy advisors is there has been a change now in thinking of u.s. strategy towards iraq . what you have now as one official just told me , is a longer term policy of military containment . essentially the united states has given up on the inspections regime and the longer term as we just heard a good case made for toppling saddam hussein and that 's certainly something the administration would like to see happen . they want to support the opposition to make that happen . but in the shorter term , what we 're going to see is essentially a monitoring of iraq with military force . if they get a sense two months from now that saddam is building up his weapons of mass destruction again , i think they 'll hit him again . we heard a long justification for the end of the -- the weapons inspection regime from president clinton tonight and he also made it plain that this is not a time when saddam hussein should think the united states is particularly weak . saddam hussein and the other enemies of peace may have thought that the serious debate currently before the house of representatives would distract americans or weaken our resolve to face him down . but once more , the united states has proven that although we 're never eager to use force , when we must act in america 's vital interests , we will do so . now , there is no sense politically speaking here , brian , that the president stands to gain or benefit from any sort of delay on the impeachment vote . the advisors at this point think he 'll lose that vote whether it happen friday or say monday or tuesday at this point . claire shipman from the white house . we 'll be checking in later on with you . claire , thank you very much .
