in slovokia , the four-party coalition that ousted long-time prime minister guadme messier in an elections last month has finally agreed on a government . voa 's art shine reports from prague . spkr : art_shine the coalition announced agreement on the distribution of cabinet posts , but will wait until thursday before announcing who gets which job . the head of the largest party , meekali jurinda of the slovak democratic coalition , is expected to be the next prime minister . the foreign minister will probably also be a member of the slovak democratic coalition , or sdk , which , despite its name , is a single party . the sdk will get nine of the twenty government posts . the three other parties in the new government are the ex-communist party of the democratic left , which will get six seats ; the party of civic understanding , with three ; and the hungarian coalition party , which will have two posts in the new government . the four parties in the new government won a commanding 62 percent of the seats in parliament , ending the long and controversial administration of former prime minister vladimir metchiar . the september election was seen by many as a referendum on mr. metchiar , who was widely criticized at home and in the west for his autocratic leadership . his government 's policies helped keep slovokia out of recent expansion plans of nato and the european union . critics say mr. metchiar failed to honor the rule of law , abused the public trust , and mismanaged the economy . although the country has enjoyed a high growth rate , the political atmosphere has kept foreign investment at a minimum , and the country is still burdened with many large , inefficient , state-owned enterprises . the metchiar government left slovokia increasingly isolated from its neighbors in central europe -- poland , hungary , and the czech republic . the incoming prime minister faces formidable challenges in turning his country into an effective market democracy . art shine , voa news , prague .
