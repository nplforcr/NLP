george w. bush has an impressive victory . before the night was out , some republicans were practically anointing him as their presidential candidate two years from now . abc 's dean reynolds reports from texas . inaudible thank you , ma ` am . reporter : and bush has a network of well-healed contributors who helped to bankroll a media campaign as slick as most races for the white house . his appeal to democrats , especially hispanics is a big political plus . speaking spanish reporter : while the governor opposes abortion and favors the death penalty and school prayer , he does n't sound strident . i do n't think he 's the favorite of the evangelical right of the republican party . but initially , he appears to be at least acceptable . and that 's absolutely critical . reporter : and being from a famous family does n't hurt . she helps a lot . no , i do not . of course , you do . reporter : he clearly loves campaigning , but he has said repeatedly that he is reluctant to put his family through what he calls the washington political meat grinder . and that has led to speculation that george w. bush lacks the requisite fire in the belly to make a race for the white house . then there are the questions about the governor 's admittedly irresponsible behavior as a young adult . it all started because somebody discovered i quit drinking . and somebody said , well , why did you quit drinking ? and i said , because i was drinking too much . reporter : this being the '90s , bush has had to assure people that he 's been faithful to his wife laura . if there was something in my closet that would disqualify me from a run , you 'd know about it . reporter : he says he will concentrate on being governor for the next few months before deciding what to do about 2000 . whatever the decision , there 's no question a lot of people will be waiting to hear what it is . dean reynolds , abc news , laredo , texas .
