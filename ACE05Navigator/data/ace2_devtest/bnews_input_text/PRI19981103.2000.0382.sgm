it 's sounding awfully familiar . iraq refuses to cooperate with u.n. weapons monitors , and the west threatens to use force to end the showdown , but this time around , the major players in baghdad , washington , and the united nations do seem to be more serious . iraq , as we will hear shortly , promised again today to continue to bar u.n. inspectors from searching for banned chemical and biological weapons . u.s. defense secretary , william cohen , has embarked on a tour of the gulf region to rally opposition to iraq 's decision , and chief u.n. weapons inspector , richard butler , today called the new standoff , `` the worst confrontation with iraq since the gulf war ended seven years ago '' . mr. butler is in new york now . can you tell us what makes this standoff more serious than the previous ones , especially the one last february , when we appears to be on the brink of a military strike ? spkr : butler this is more serious because on this occasion , iraq has moved on from simply trying to stop our disarmament work , the work of searching out the illegal weapons it has held in the past and to some extent has today , into also preventing us to monitor the capacity and actions of iraq to recreate - reconstitute those weapons in the future . we have those two jobs . one , disarmament , that 's the past , and two , monitoring , that 's the future , so this is across the board on this occasion . they 're trying to shut us down in all respects . spkr : mullens no , though we did get some news from baghdad today that some technicians , apparently , were able to carry out some kind of work this morning . is any inspection or any monitoring work of substance being carried out there . spkr : butler none . none . what they were able to do was to tend to some cameras , remote-sensing devices , but they are a minuscule fraction of our monitoring program which relies overwhelmingly on human visits , and in that context , we 've been shut down . spkr : mullens so then aside , mr. butler , from the frustration of having your own mission interrupted yet again , i wonder to what extent do you fear that iraq is using this restriction and the earlier one , curbing inspections in august , to try to rejuvenate its , uh , it 's biological and chemical weapons . spkr : butler well , it 's not easy to quantify that . you ca n't talk about what you ca n't see , but the basic position is that the security council has made the law here . it requires us to be able to give it the assurance that iraq is not reconstituting those weapons , and i reported to the council not many hours ago that we are no longer in the position to give any such assurance . now , what iraq is doing with that time - how much the cat is - the mouse are playing while the cat 's away would be foolish for me to speculate , but the possibility is there . spkr : mullens let 's talk about what 's happening on the security council . from the previous divisions within the council to the criticisms that have happened within unscum itself within the team - how concerned are you that the objective of cleaning iraq of its weapons is - is being undermined and that iraq is exploiting what seem to be weak links . spkr : butler well , i would n't make too much of the arguments that have taken place within the council . you 've got to draw a distinction between fundamental concerns and methods of approach . now , there are various approaches towards the disarmament task that have been expressed in the council . there 's a healthy discussion takes place about those , but there 's no variation or difference at all with respect to the basic need for iraq to comply and to be disarmed . and certainly , when one turns to the other part of our work , namely monitoring , there is utter unity of purpose in the council that a good effective long-term monitoring system has to be in place before we can be satisfied with transiting iraq out of the disarmament phase into the long-term monitoring phase , so there 's no - there 's no real dispute about fundamentals . spkr : mullens baghdad has demanded your dismissal . are you going to oblige ? spkr : butler well , would n't - would n't life be simple if it were as easy as that ? uh , what a red herring ; what a diversion from the real facts . i mean , the fact is we 're dealing with weapons , not the question of who sits on the helm of my organization . uh , it 's one of the oldest tricks in the bag - if you do n't like the message , shoot the messenger . no , i wo n't be obliging because that would be to give in to what is a transparent distraction . the issue is their weapons , not who runs my organization . spkr : mullens head of the united nations ' special commission for disarming iraq , richard butler . thank you very much for joining us . spkr : butler thank you . spkr : mullens
