now no american influence in kosovo . it is a week since the u.s. and nato pressured the serbian leader , slobodan milosevic , to end the serb violence against the ethnic albanians there . today the pentagon said we have not seen full compliance or anything close to it . sheila macvicar is in kosovo tonight . reporter : this is what the first american and european monitors are seeing as they drive throughout kosovo . past miles of destroyed and empty villages , serb police checkpoints where traffic is stopped and identity papers checked . on hilltops , fortified serb positions , and sometimes serb armored vehicles -- dozens of tanks and heavy weapons dug in and camouflaged . these certainly look like violations of the agreement . the problem is , the agreement itself is so short on specifics , western monitors can not say what is a violation and what is not . i think that this is going to have to be worked out on a case-by-case basis . reporter : with officials still trying to sort out just what the deal means , the bottom line is that the ethnic albanian refugees are supposed to feel safe enough to go home and stay home . but that is not happening either . `` the serb police are just up there , '' this man says , `` and they have a new checkpoint down there . '' and for the last several nights , the serbs have shelled these villages . so while people have been coming home in the morning , every night people leave the village and go back to the mountains . i was really disappointed to come back after the agreement was signed . i expected to see an improvement . reporter : the agreement has done virtually nothing to change the serb position , that they have the right to deploy their forces as they see fit . sheila macvicar , abc news , kosovo .
