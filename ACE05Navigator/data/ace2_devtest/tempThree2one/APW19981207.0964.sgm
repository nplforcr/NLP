PARIS (AP) _ He compressed car wrecks, blue jeans, vegetable
crates - even fake Cartier watches - and turned them into art
prized by museums and collectors worldwide.
Cesar Baldaccini, the immigrant son of a cleaning lady who
became one of France's leading contemporary sculptors died Sunday
of cancer at his Paris home.
Cesar, as he was known, was famous for giving the French cinema
stars the coveted golden statue of excellence, the U.S. equivalent
of the Oscar. The award, first given in 1976, is called the Cesar.
A high-profile bon vivant on the Paris celebrity scene, Cesar
was best-known for squashing, expanding and molding the discarded
scraps of 20th century life.
``Cesar has incarnated sculpture at its highest level since the
late 1950s,'' Culture Minister Catherine Trautmann said. His art,
she said, oogave us a new definition of modernity.''
President Jacques Chirac praised Cesar's ``strength, capacity
for renewal and force of his creative ideas.''
Despite the official accolades, Cesar was sometimes snubbed by
the art establishment which had criticized him in recent years for
selling out to commercial interest.
His famed ``Thumb'' - a reproduction of his own thumb and finger
prints - today is available in every size for every budget. One
version at La Defense corporate park outside Paris is 12 meters
high (about 40 feet).
``The French estabishment always has trouble with commercial
success,'' said art critic Ann Cremin. ``Cesar was a life force.
Where ever he was there was a buzz. People gravitated to him, yet
he refused to take himself seriously.''
Cremin recalled how Cesar once agreed to compact the wreckage of
a friend after a serious accident. The friend now displays the
sculpture of the near-miss in his Paris living room.
``He's France's Andy Warhol,'' she said.
Born Jan. 1, 1921 in Marseille, the son of Italian immigrants,
Cesar earned pocket money making sausage for the family butcher. He
quit school at 12, but went on to study art in Marseille and Paris.
Too poor to afford clay, Cesar would rummage through city dumps
for scrap metal to recyle into art.
A member of the New Realism movement, Cesar ``sculpted'' other
objects by striking them with a sledgehammer: bicycles, vegetable
crates, coffee pots. He once compacted thousands of fake Cartier
tank watches seized by French customs officials.
He also made a giant breast cast from the bosom of a dancer at
the Crazy Horse cabaret.
As Cesar himself put it: ``I'm not an intellectual. I like to
touch. It's my hands that make my head work.''
The funeral was scheduled for Thursday in Paris at the
Saint-Germain-des-Pres Church to be followed by burial at the
Montparnasse cemetery.
