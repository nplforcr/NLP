Turning to another part of the world that has seen similar acts of ethnic
violence, in Rwanda a former government official has been sentenced to life
in prison for genocide. As VOA Correspondent Scott Sterns reports, the
accused is planning to appeal the decision of the United Nations courts.

Former Mayor Jean Paul Lafayette who got three life sentences for his role
in Rwanda's 1994 genocide on separate counts of crimes against humanity.
Akyetsu was sentenced to 15 years for rape and murder, 10 years for
torture. He's already appealed convictions on nine counts of genocide
before United Nation judges at the Criminal Tribunal in Tanzania. Akyetsu
is expected to appeal Friday's sentencing, as well, as the case now moves
to Europe and the chambers of the U.N. Criminal Tribunal for the former
Yugoslovia. Akyetsu's case was the first for the U.N. prosecutor's office
in Rwanda. During his 15 month trial, Akyetsu, on occasion, represented
himself, cross-examining some witnesses and complaining about court
translators. Akyetsu testified he was powerless to stop the merger of an
estimated 2000 ethnic Tutsi's in the district of Tawba. Last month, he
told the court he weeps for everyone killed during the genocide and asks
the forgiveness of the people of Tawba (ph who he says he tried to protect,
but did not succeed because of weakness. At the start of the genocide four
years ago, U.N. prosecutors agreed that then-Mayor Akyetsu was a moderate
man who tried to calm extremist militia, hunting the ethnic Tutsi. But
following a speech by Rwanda Prime Minister Jean Componda, prosecutors say
Akyetsu became the leader of the genocide in Tawba, organizing the killing
and torture of Tutsi and politically moderate Hutu. Former Prime Minister
Componda was sentenced to life earlier this year after pleading guilty to
genocide. It's not clear where either men will serve his sentence as the
U.N. is yet to announce its choice of a prison, likely in Africa that meets
international standards. Scott Sterns, VOA News, East Africa Bureau
