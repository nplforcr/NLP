In Russia, where brutal winters are a fact of life, 1998 has been even
worse than usual.
Especially in Russia's frigid far east, just across the bering sea from
alaska.
People there are in danger of starvation.
Here's NBC's Dana Lewis.

In the town of transportnoye, 200 miles north of the Arctic
circle, the population is now one Nikolai pribytkov, the last remaining
resident, along with a few stray dogs.
"I'm only here temporarily," he says.
"Sooner or later I will have to move out."
In September, the Russian government evacuated 1,000 residents from
transportnoye -- people out of work, running out of food.
In a land where life is always harsh, temperatures of minus 40 normal,
somehow this winter is even worse.
Situation critical in the region of chukotka.
Slumping gold prices have all but wiped out the areas main source of
revenue -- mining.
Supplies that come by plane are expensive.
Prices for food have tripled since September.
Russia's economic crisis and slumping ruble have seen to that.
Frontier towns are dyeing.
In pevek, 560 miles west of Alaska, a hunger strike by power workers who
haven't been paid in 3 1/2 years.
They can't afford to buy their own food and don't want government handouts.
Residents want to leave, have even packed belongings in containers.
But no one can afford the flight out.
In Moscow, the government doesn't know what to do.
It failed to ship winter supplies of fuel oil, food and medicine to the
north before the rivers froze over.
Now there is talk of large-scale evacuations as winter stocks are running
out.

You depend on supplies from central or southern Russia and supplies not
delivered on time.
Very grave situation.
And near disaster.

Hoping to avoid northern evacuations, Russia is counting on air
lifts of food aid from western countries, including the U.S. but it's a
Race against time.
Only these reindeer herders, who have spent generations learning to live
off the land, seem secure.
They'll survive one of the bleakest winters to hit northern Russia.
