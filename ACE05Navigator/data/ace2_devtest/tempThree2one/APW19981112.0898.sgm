BONN, Germany (AP) _ German Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine
denied media reports Thursday that he was a candidate to succeed
Jacques Santer as the European Commission president.
A Social Democratic European parliamentarian, Klaus Haensch,
told Saarlaendischer Rundfunk radio that he is promoting Lafontaine
as a candidate for the post. ``It's Germany's turn to occupy this
post,'' Haensch said. A German last held the commission presidency
from 1958-67.
Germany already has sought French support for a German
candidate, the weekly Die Zeit reported in its latest edition,
published Thursday.
But Lafontaine issued a statement rejecting ``rumors and
speculation'' that he planned to take the Brussels job as
``nonsense.''
In Brussels, European Commission spokeswoman Martine Reichert
declined to comment on the report that Lafontaine would succeed
Santer, whose five-year term expires at the end of 1999.
Under EU rules, the commission president is selected by the 15
EU governments, each of which has the right to put forward a
candidate, and their choice must be ratified by the European
Parliament.
Lafontaine already has substantial influence in the new Social
Democratic-led German government, occupying both the party's top
post and running the Finance Ministry as Germany joins 10 other
European countries in the monetary union launching Jan. 1.
