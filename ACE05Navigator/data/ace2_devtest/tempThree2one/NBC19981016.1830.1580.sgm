The nobel peace prize was awarded today, as expected, for the agreement
that brought a measure of peace and the promise of much more to northern
Ireland.
Many were involved in that effort, including former U.S. senator George
Mitchell.
But everyone agrees it would not have happened without David trimble, a
Protestant leader, and John Hume, a Catholic.
So they will receive the coveted prize.
And everyone agrees no one has been at this longer or with greater passion
than John Hume.
John Hume has been trying to bring an end to this for more than 30 years.
Even when it seemed hopeless, John Hume never lost his wanting to do
something.

Then -- a local hero.
And today -- a hero known 'round the world.
It strengthens our peace process enorm owsley.

Hume's hero -- a leader from another time, another place.
Hume says it is Martin Luther king's message of nonviolent change that
inspired him.
<TURN>
I thought that if 20,000 soldiers on our streets couldn't stop the killing
on our streets, and direct dialogue could, it was my duty to do so.
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> Reporter: </ANNOTATION>
Duty born of the hope his father taught him growing up in a poor,
Catholic and divided town.
His father's most valued lesson?
<TURN>
One man can make a difference, and every man should try.

Eventually he would join an lead the movement for peace.
Then, 1972, bloody Sunday -- the worst of northern Ireland's guerilla war.

When we were attacked in the civil rights movement, I always said, "do not
retaliate.
Let the world see who the real aggressor is."
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> Reporter: </ANNOTATION>
That peaceful approach would lead to years of secret and
eventually publicized talks with divided factions.
Cease-fires would come and go.
With thousands of lives lost, Hume's persistence finally pays off when this
year's intense talk brings about an historic handshake.
They hoped they had finally managed a peace.
<TURN>
This agreement proves that democracy works.
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> Reporter: </ANNOTATION>
American statesman George Mitchell acted as chief negotiator.
<TURN>
There wouldn't have been a peace process without John Hume.
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> Reporter: </ANNOTATION>
Mitchell says the violence will not disappear overnight.
Indeed, only weeks after the agreement, a shocking setback -- more deadly
bombings.
Now, uncertainty lingers.
But John Hume does not give up hope.
Hope that his children will grow up in a peaceful Ireland, that his prize
will not have been won in vain.
