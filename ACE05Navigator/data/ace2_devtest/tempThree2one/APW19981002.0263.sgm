ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ A U.N. court on Friday ordered a former
Rwandan mayor to serve three life sentences for convictions of
genocide and crimes against humanity, plus 80 years for other
violations including rape.
In the first judgment by an international court on genocide,
Jean-Paul Akayesu was convicted Sept. 2 of nine counts of genocide,
crimes against humanity and rape.
Akayesu had made an impassioned plea Monday for forgiveness from
the Rwandan people for the genocide of more than 500,000 people,
mostly minority Tutsis, in 1994.
However, Judge Laity Kama said Friday Akayesu ``chose to
participate in the genocide,'' and should therefore spend the rest
of his life in prison, according to the Swiss-based Hirondelle news
agency.
``The chamber is of the opinion ... that genocide constitutes
the crime of crimes,'' Kama told the court. Akayesu was ordered to
serve the sentences concurrently, which means he will serve a
single life sentence.
Akayesu stood silently, showing no emotion as the sentence was
read.
The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda was formed in
November 1994, months after an extremist Hutu government sponsored
the 90-day slaughter. The genocide ended only when Tutsi-led rebels
took power in July 1994.
Akayesu, who was born in 1953, was mayor of the central village
of Taba where 2,000 Tutsis who sought his protection were killed.
He has maintained his innocence, claiming he was unable to stop the
slaughter.
Acting in his own defense during his pre-sentencing hearing
Monday, Akayesu said remorsefully, ``I regret what happened from
the bottom of my heart.'' He also asked for God's forgiveness,
Hirondelle reported.
Prosecutor Pierre Prosper called the former mayor a predator and
asked for seven life sentences plus additional lesser sentences for
other crimes. He later said he was satisfied with Akayesu's life
sentence, the maximum penalty the U.N. tribunal can impose.
Akayesu has appealed his convictions, Hirondelle reported.
The tribunal, in Akayesu's precedent-setting judgment, had ruled
that rape and sexual violence were brutally wielded as tools of
genocide in Rwanda in 1994. No one accused Akayesu personally of
rape, but many witnesses said he incited the sexual abuse of Tutsi
women. He was sentenced to 15 years for rape.
During the 20-month trial, Akayesu fired his defense team three
times, most recently on Monday, and has represented himself on
several occasions.
The tribunal is holding 31 people in Arusha. Another person is
in custody in Texas.
Friday's sentencing was the tribunal's second. Ex-Prime Minister
Jean Kambanda, 42, pleaded guilty in May and was sentenced to life
imprisonment on Sept. 4.
Rwandan courts have tried at least 330 people in the genocide,
and 116 have been sentenced to death. A total of 126,078 people are
imprisoned and awaiting trial, according to the Red Cross.
On April 24, the Rwandan government executed 22 genocide
convicts by firing squad, the first executions for the slaughter.
At the Yugoslav tribunal, two men have received sentences, but
neither was for genocide.
All those accused in the post-World War II Nuremberg trials
pleaded innocent to charges including murder and extermination. The
trials predated the establishment of the crime of genocide 50 years
ago.
