It's sounding awfully familiar. Iraq
refuses to cooperate with U.N. weapons monitors, and the west threatens to
use force to end the showdown, but this time around, the major players in
Baghdad, Washington, and the United Nations do seem to be more serious.
Iraq, as we will hear shortly, promised again today to continue to bar U.N.
inspectors from searching for banned chemical and biological weapons. U.S.
Defense Secretary, William Cohen, has embarked on a tour of the gulf region
to rally opposition to Iraq's decision, and Chief U.N. Weapons Inspector,
Richard Butler, today called the new standoff, "the worst confrontation
with Iraq since the Gulf War ended seven years ago". Mr. Butler is in New
York now. Can you tell us what makes this standoff more serious than the
previous ones, especially the one last February, when we appears to be on
the brink of a military strike?
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> spkr:Butler </ANNOTATION>
This is more serious because on this occasion, Iraq has moved on from
simply trying to stop our disarmament work, the work of searching out the
illegal weapons it has held in the past and to some extent has today, into
also preventing us to monitor the capacity and actions of Iraq to recreate
- reconstitute those weapons in the future. We have those two jobs. One,
disarmament, that's the past, and two, monitoring, that's the future, so
this is across the board on this occasion. They're trying to shut us down
in all respects.
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> spkr:Mullens </ANNOTATION>
No, though we did get some news from Baghdad today that some technicians,
apparently, were able to carry out some kind of work this morning. Is any
inspection or any monitoring work of substance being carried out there.
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> spkr:Butler </ANNOTATION>
None. None. What they were able to do was to tend to some cameras,
remote-sensing devices, but they are a minuscule fraction of our monitoring
program which relies overwhelmingly on human visits, and in that context,
we've been shut down.
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> spkr:Mullens </ANNOTATION>
So then aside, Mr. Butler, from the frustration of having your own mission
interrupted yet again, I wonder to what extent do you fear that Iraq is
using this restriction and the earlier one, curbing inspections in August,
to try to rejuvenate its, uh, it's biological and chemical weapons.
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> spkr:Butler </ANNOTATION>
Well, it's not easy to quantify that. You can't talk about what you can't
see, but the basic position is that the security council has made the law
here. It requires us to be able to give it the assurance that Iraq is not
reconstituting those weapons, and I reported to the council not many hours
ago that we are no longer in the position to give any such assurance. Now,
what Iraq is doing with that time - how much the cat is - the mouse are
playing while the cat's away would be foolish for me to speculate, but the
possibility is there.
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> spkr:Mullens </ANNOTATION>
Let's talk about what's happening on the Security Council. From the
previous divisions within the council to the criticisms that have happened
within UNSCUM itself within the team - how concerned are you that the
objective of cleaning Iraq of its weapons is - is being undermined and that
Iraq is exploiting what seem to be weak links.
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> spkr:Butler </ANNOTATION>
Well, I wouldn't make too much of the arguments that have taken place
within the council. You've got to draw a distinction between fundamental
concerns and methods of approach. Now, there are various approaches towards
the disarmament task that have been expressed in the council. There's a
healthy discussion takes place about those, but there's no variation or
difference at all with respect to the basic need for Iraq to comply and to
be disarmed. And certainly, when one turns to the other part of our work,
namely monitoring, there is utter unity of purpose in the council that a
good effective long-term monitoring system has to be in place before we can
be satisfied with transiting Iraq out of the disarmament phase into the
long-term monitoring phase, so there's no - there's no real dispute about
fundamentals.
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> spkr:Mullens </ANNOTATION>
Baghdad has demanded your dismissal. Are you going to oblige?
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> spkr:Butler </ANNOTATION>
Well, wouldn't - wouldn't life be simple if it were as easy as that? Uh,
what a red herring; what a diversion from the real facts. I mean, the fact
is we're dealing with weapons, not the question of who sits on the helm of
my organization. Uh, it's one of the oldest tricks in the bag - if you
don't like the message, shoot the messenger. No, I won't be obliging
because that would be to give in to what is a transparent distraction. The
issue is their weapons, not who runs my organization.
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> spkr:Mullens </ANNOTATION>
Head of the United Nations' Special Commission for Disarming Iraq, Richard
Butler. Thank you very much for joining us.
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> spkr:Butler </ANNOTATION>
Thank you.
