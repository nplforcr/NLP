Doctors in San Francisco are debating whether a prison inmate with only one
kidney should be permitted to donate that organ to his daughter.
By doing so, David Patterson would put his own life in jeopardy.
He would need kidney dialysis while serving the final three years of his
prison sentence.
16-year-old Renada Daniel Patterson desperately needs this transplant,
because the kidney her father gave her two years ago is now failing.
Her mother is hoping someone else will come forward.
