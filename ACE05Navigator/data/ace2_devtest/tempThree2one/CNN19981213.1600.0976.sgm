Representatives from Washington are in Little Rock, Arkansas, today to
address black farmers.
At issue, allegations of racism and discrimination.
Jason Peterson of our affiliate katv has the story.

For most of the past two decades, black farmers in Arkansas have
been complaining that they were being discriminated against by the local
officials who control farm loans and crop payments.
But nothing changed.
So last year, they joined fellow black farmers across America and sued the
government.
The usda agrees that minority farmers have lost significant amounts of land
and significant income as a result of discrimination.
Many of the farmers gathered last month to listen to the government's
proposed settlement.

If you had stuck together, there would be no lawsuit, there would be no
settlement.

In reality, there still is no settlement, but the talks continue
and that's why Sam Taylor is visiting Arkansas farmers this weekend.
<TURN>
To try to keep the plaintiffs and the farm families as abreast as possible.
They are also at a vital stage in next year's farm season basically starts
the 1st of January, and we're hopeful we'll have a settlement in place by
then.
Hopeful of that.

Right now, the proposed settlement looks like this.
Farmers could choose blan A, which would include a $50,000 cash payment and
relief from all farm-related debt owed to the federal government.
Or if a farmer has documentation to prove that discrimination has cost them
more, he could pass up plan "A" and sue for more under plan "B".

You never say you have a deal had you don't have a deal.

Taylor met with farmers and said negotiations between the farmers and
government will continue through the end of next month.
If no agreement is reached, this lawsuit is set for trial February 1st.

That was Jason Peterson of affiliate katv.
