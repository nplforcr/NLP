HIGASHI-IBARAKI, Japan (AP) _ Naomichi ``Joe'' Ozaki and Koki
Idoki shot one-under-par 71s Thursday, taking a one-stroke lead
with 27 players yet to finish the rain-delayed first round of the
120 million yen (dlrs 882,000) Japan Open Golf Championship.
Darkness halted play after 87 of the 114 players had finished 18
holes. The first round was to be completed Friday morning.
The 42-year-old Joe Ozaki, youngest of three Ozaki brothers,
shot five birdies and four bogeys on the 7,160-yard, par-72 Oarai
Golf Club course.
Idoki had two birdies and one bogey.
``I needed energy on each hole because of strong rain. I feel
like I played two rounds,'' said Joe Ozaki, who is seeking his
first victory of the season and 26th of his Japan PGA Tour career.
Defending champion Craig Parry of Australia shot a 72 with two
birdies and two bogeys and shared third place with Chen Tze-chung
of Taiwan and five Japanese _ Masashi ``Jumbo'' Ozaki, Joe's eldest
brother; Hidemichi Tanaka; Yasuharu Imano; Nobumitsu Yuhara and
Takeshi Nakajima.
At 73 were Americans Brandt Jobe and Peter Teravainen and five
Japanese.
Among the 27 yet to finish the first round were Eduardo Herrera
of Colombia and Hsieh Chin-sheng of Taiwan.
The winner will receive 24 million yen (dlrs 176,000).
