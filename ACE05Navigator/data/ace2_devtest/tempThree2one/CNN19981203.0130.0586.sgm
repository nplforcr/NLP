The real-life case that inspired "the fugitive" TV series took a major turn
wednesday.
The Ohio state Supreme Court gave the son of Dr. Sam sheppard another
chance to clear his father's name.
Holly Firfer has more.

For ten years, Sam Reese sheppard has fought to clear his
father's name.
<TURN>
Sam and I are thrilled that maybe before the end of the century, we will
put this case to rest.
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> Reporter: </ANNOTATION>
The decision by the Ohio Supreme Court means sheppard can proceed
with his wrongful imprisonment suit against the state.
It could also mean his father, Dr. Sam sheppard, will officially be found
innocent of a horrible crime.
<TURN>
It was a very violent, passionate crime.

Fred drenkin was the first police officer on the scene at the
sheppard home back in 1954.
He found the body of Marilyn sheppard in an upstairs bedroom.
She had been brutally beaten and killed.
Dr. sheppard claimed an intruder committed the crime.
But the police didn't buy it and neither did a jury.
Dr. sheppard was convicted of murdering his wife and sent to prison.
<TURN>
I don't know who else would have done it.

<ANNOTATION> Reporter: </ANNOTATION>
But sheppard won the right to a new trial.
And 12 years later, another jury found him not guilty.
The son says, that's not good enough.
<TURN>
It still suggests that people somehow had a good lawyer and got off.
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> Reporter: </ANNOTATION>
For sheppard to win this case, his father will have to be found
innocent.
And the son could collect some $2 million in damages.
<TURN>
I think it's just very sad and very pathetic that people have to either
claim that I'm some kind of loony or some kind of money grubber over my --
the bodies of my dead loved ones.
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> Reporter: </ANNOTATION>
New DNA evidence suggests others may have committed the crime.
But drenkin sees no point in another trial.
<TURN>
I just don't understand how we keep rehashing it, rehashing it.
And there's always a new suspect.
And it never stops.
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> Reporter: </ANNOTATION>
It's been nearly 45 years and the case of Marilyn sheppard is
still not closed.
