MOSCOW (AP) _ Since winning re-election in 1996, Boris Yeltsin
has been on a two-year losing streak.
His shaky health has become a national obsession and keeps him
away from the Kremlin for days, and sometimes weeks, at a time.
The economy is suffering through its worst breakdown in the
post-Soviet era, but he rarely raises the subject and hasn't even
hinted at a recovery plan.
Even if he did, a growing band of critics argues, he's too weak
physically and politically to launch any ambitious reforms before
his term ends in 2000.
Always eager to show he's still in charge, Yeltsin has fired the
entire government twice this year. But to what end? The new
government, led by Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, is a mishmash
of politicians from various groups who are struggling to put
together a coherent economic program
Yeltsin, 67, brushes aside worries about his health and says
there is no chance he will quit before his term ends. The Russian
constitution makes impeachment an unlikely option, yet the clamor
for Yeltsin's resignation is louder than it's ever been.
``Every one of his public events is painful to watch,'' said
Andrei Piontkovsky, a political analyst and harsh critic of the
president. ``He's out of touch. The state of his health and the
state of mind are deplorable.''
Several leading Russian newspapers have urged Yeltsin to step
down. They freely speculate about whether he has Alzheimer's
disease, or a return of heart problems that necessitated quintuple
bypass surgery two years ago.
Yeltsin's public approval rating is in the single digits, but
the president's hard-line foes have had difficulty turning this
disenchantment into mass support.
Protests around the country on Oct. 7 drew about 1 million
marchers, but the crowds were much smaller than predicted and have
not resulted in any sustained labor unrest.
Still, the president is losing support from traditionally
friendly camps.
``Temporary incapacity is one thing, but if a person cannot work
and permanently perform his functions, he should muster the will
and courage to say that,'' Moscow Mayor Luzhkov said Friday.
``Everything now depends on the president himself.''
Luzhkov, a likely presidential contender in 2000, has been an
ally of Yeltsin and has never before openly questioned the
president's health or his ability to govern.
Yeltsin normally relishes a good fight and is at his best at
times of confrontation.
Yet he has responded to the economic crisis by keeping a profile
so low it borders on reclusive. He spends most days at a country
residence to the west of Moscow, venturing into the Kremlin perhaps
two or three times a week, and then only for a few hours.
Most public appearances are carefully controlled meetings in his
Kremlin office, where he chitchats with government officials
briefly for the benefit of the camera.
Last week's trip to Central Asia was his first foreign journey
in five months, and it proved a public relations disaster. Yeltsin
almost fell at a red carpet ceremony in Uzbekistan. He canceled
meetings, cut short a news conference and headed home a day early
with a respiratory infection.
He has called off a trip to a summit in Malaysia next month, and
government sources said one reason was concern about the effects of
the long flight on his health.
If Yeltsin were to resign _ an unlikely scenario at this point _
then Primakov would take over as president temporarily and a
presidential election would be held within three months.
The leading contenders would be Luzhkov, former security chief
Alexander Lebed and Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov. To
some, the signs of a campaign are already visible.
``It seems to me we are already in the middle of a new
presidential race,'' said Piontkovsky, the analyst.
