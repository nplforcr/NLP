TORONTO (AP) _ Seven-year-old Ken Dryden looked under the tree
on Christmas Day 1954 and beheld a most beautiful sight: his first
hockey uniform.
To this day, he considers it the best Christmas present he's
ever received.
``What I remember the most were the pants,'' Dryden said. ``They
were made of that material that's like satin and they were shiny.''
Now, the Hall of Fame goaltender and president-general manager
of the National Hockey League's Toronto Maple Leafs is preparing to
open a much bigger package: Air Canada Centre, the new home of the
Leafs and the National Basketball Association's Toronto Raptors.
Plans for the first NHL game Feb. 20 in the new arena and for
the last NHL game in Maple Leaf Gardens Feb. 13 were outlined
Wednesday by Dryden and Richard Peddie, president and CEO of Maple
Leaf Sports and Entertainment, the parent company of the NHL and
NBA teams.
A Feb. 6 open house with free tours and skating kicks things
off. After the final game in the Gardens, there will be a one-hour
postgame celebration broadcast live nationally by CBC and a street
party next door.
The Leafs have set aside 1,000 game tickets in the upper
sections, and fans can submit ballots to win the right to purchase
a pair at the regular price of dlrs 26.50 per ticket.
``We knew that if we put them on public sale scalpers were going
to get them,'' Dryden said. ``Now we can't guarantee they're not
going to get them but we can make it harder.
``We wanted to do as much as we could to see that the real fan
has a chance of getting into the building.''
The ballot winner who lives the furthest from Toronto will have
flights to the city and hotel reservations paid for by the Leafs,
Dryden said.
Scalpers are asking for as much as dlrs 3,500 a ticket for the
final game at Maple Leaf Gardens.
Leafs alumni _ anyone who played 50 or more games for the team _
will be a big part of the closing of the Gardens. About 155
qualify.
``We've sent a note out to the alumni saying, `We want you to be
able to get into the game.,' '' Dryden said. `` `You get here,
you're in the building.' ''
Specific details about entertainment guests, anthem singers and
VIP alumni are being kept secret.
An Air Canada open house is Feb. 14, and a black tie gala Feb.
18 on the event floor is expected to raise dlrs 200,000 for
youth-related charities.
On Feb. 19, championship banners will be transferred from the
Gardens to the Air Canada Centre in a parade down Yonge Street. The
48th Highlanders pipe band will lead the way and former stars will
ride the route.
The Montreal Canadiens will play the Leafs in the first game in
the dlrs 265 million facility. There will be a special pregame
ceremony.
