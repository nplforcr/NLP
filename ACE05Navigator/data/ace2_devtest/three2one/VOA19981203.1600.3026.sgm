WTO economists say world trade and the economy are still on a downward
slope, and it's difficult to forecast what will happen in 1999. It's a big
change from only a year ago when the export growth rate hit a record 10
percent. Largely because of the financial turmoil in Asia, this year's
growth rate is expected to drop to less than 5 percent. Nevertheless, the
report says trade continues to be double that of overall economic growth.
WTO Senior Economist Michael Finger warns that, in the wake of the world
economic slowdown, countries should not give into protectionist tendencies.
He says if developed countries restrict imports from developing countries,
this will deepen the problem.

This would activate the situation in the financial markets because these
developing countries which are dependent on export earnings in order to
finance their development -- they would get into more difficulties, banks
would be even more reluctant to give them new money, and in this respect,
the whole situation could activate.

The report says maintaining open markets and expanding world trade is the
way to overcome the current global crisis. It finds the Asian slump
contributed significantly to depressing commodity markets. On a positive
note, the report finds North America did exceptionally well in 1997, and
while exports slowed down this year, the report says the United States
played a significant role in sustaining global trade expansion during the
first nine months of 1998. Mr. Finger says growth in Western Europe also
accelerated at the beginning of this year.

Now under the widening of the crisis in Asia, there is some slowing down,
and many observers believe now that the growth will be less next year than
this year. So the recovery comes to a halt, but it could be a still
expanding in Western Europe.

The World Trade Organization report says Latin America, the world's most
dynamic region in 1997, suffered a sharp slowdown in this year, and it
finds that Africa and the Middle East are the two regions most affected by
the dramatic decline in commodity prices. Lisa Schlein for VOA News,
