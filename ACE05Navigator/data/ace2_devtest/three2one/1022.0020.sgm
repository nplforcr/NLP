SAN DIEGO, Oct. 21 -
Brian Cashman was still an assistant general manager with the Yankees when an 
official from the Oakland Athletics raised the possibility of trading Scott 
Brosius to New York last fall. 

''I don't think so,'' Cashman told Billy Beane, then assistant general manager for 
Oakland. ''But let me check with my people.'' Cashman was negotiating, of course, 
immediately responding with lack of interest. But Cashman had communicated his 
own instincts as well: No way. He knew Brosius was coming off a bad year, and he 
knew Brosius would be in line to make a decent salary. 

After Cashman and Bob Watson, then the Yankee general manager, checked with 
their scouts, others assured them that Brosius was worth having -- and the rest 
is history. 

Brosius hammered two home runs Tuesday night in Game 3 of the World Series and 
singled home the third run of the game tonight to help the Yankees wrap up their 
24th title. It also helped Brosius nail down the Series most valuable player 
award; he finished with 8 hits in 17 times up (.471), including 2 homers and 6 
runs batted in. For the 13-game post-season, Brosius batted .383 with 6 homers 
and 15 r.b.i. 

When the game ended, a jubilant Brosius leaped several times and then joined his 
teammates, who jumped on top of each other. Later, in a joyous clubhouse, he 
said, ''To come over here like this, I just feel privileged to be a part of this 
team.'' Holding his m.v.p. trophy, he said: ''I don't know what to do with this 
thing. It's bigger and heavier than anything I've ever gotten.'' 

Brosius batted .300 and drove in 98 runs during the regular season. In the 
estimation of his teammate Derek Jeter, he has been the team's m.v.p. -- a 
pleasant surprise to club executives, who had hoped only that Brosius would play 
solid defense and contribute a few hits. 

''We didn't know exactly what Scott Brosius was all about,'' said Manager Joe 
Torre. ''You pick up a press guide and you see numbers, and last year he wasn't 
that good.'' 

An understatement: Brosius was terrible for Oakland in 1997, a year in which 
''everything that could go bad did,'' he recalled. 

''Everything from just at times swinging the bat horribly to other times swinging 
the bat pretty good and being unlucky, and just not feeling real healthy, 
either,'' Brosius said. ''It was just one of those things that kind of snowballed, 
and I was never able to come out of it.'' 

Brosius batted .203 with 11 home runs and 41 r.b.i., with others on the team 
feeling as if Brosius' quiet intensity hampered him as his slump deepened. He 
had batted .304 in 1996, hitting 22 home runs, but given his age of 31, it was 
easy to speculate he was in decline. 

When Beane called Cashman after the 1997 season and told him the Athletics were 
intent on trading Brosius before the Nov. 18 expansion draft, Cashman had his 
doubts. But the Yankees needed a third baseman, having determined to allow the 
aging Wade Boggs to depart as a free agent, and to exile Charlie Hayes. Cashman 
called Ron Brand, the Yankees' West Coast scout. 

''This guy can play,'' Brand told Cashman, noting Brosius' strong defense and the 
fact that he always played hard and was well liked by teammates. Even if Brosius 
doesn't hit enough to be the everyday third baseman, Brand told Cashman, he 
could be an exceptional utilityman, because he could play just about any 
position. 

Today, Brand said: ''I heard some guys talk about how he was complaining, but I 
never saw that in the way he played. I never saw him complaining in the paper. 
He was always very gracious. He's a model citizen. I figured he just had an off 
year.'' 

The deal was arranged: The Yankees sent Kenny Rogers and $5 million to Oakland 
for Brosius, who agreed to a $2.5 million contract for 1998. But the Yankees 
wanted protection, as well, and signed Dale Sveum to a two-year contract; they 
knew, too, that the minor leaguer Mike Lowell could be an option. 

By the end of spring training, Brosius had won the third-base job and Torre was 
talking about how Brosius was the best he had ever seen at charging in and 
barehanding grounders and throwing to first. He batted .263 in April, but on 
April 22, e drove in five runs against Toronto's Roger Clemens with three hits. 
This is a guy, Cashman thought to himself, that can get big hits, and Brosius 
exploded in May, batting .396. 

Brosius can be a free agent after this season, and his agent had cursory talks 
with the Yankees in June and July. Lowell is waiting for his chance, coming off 
an exceptional season with Class AAA Columbus, but re-signing Brosius appears to 
be a priority in the off season. 

(He figures to be in line for a three-year deal, perhaps for something in the 
range of $4 million to $5 million a season, and has indicated he would take less 
than his market value to remain with the Yankees). 

''I anticipate we'll knock it out,'' said Cashman, who must also negotiate with 
free agent-to-be Bernie Williams. ''Ultimately, we'd like to keep him, though 
we're protected with Lowell coming up.'' 


INSIDE PITCH 


The Yankees will make BERNIE WILLIAMS a contract offer that will certainly be 
less than what other teams offer, and it may be that Williams chooses to return. 
But Williams and Yankees officials seemed more resigned that he would not 
return.
