WATERTOWN, Conn., Nov. 4 -  
Despite a commanding re-election victory on Tuesday, Gov. John G. Rowland may be 
finding that it is lonely at the top. 

He trounced Representative Barbara B. Kennelly by 28 percentage points, but 
failed to sweep along any of his four fellow Republicans seeking statewide 
offices, or the Republican running for United States Senate, or either of the 
Congressional candidates he had been promoting, or enough new State Senators to 
give his party control of the chamber after two years in the minority. 

''The emperor has no coattails,'' said Matthew Miller, the spokesman for the state 
Democratic Party's campaign arm, the Campaign for Connecticut Families. 

Interestingly, ''the emperor'' makes few excuses. Governor Rowland, who was in an 
even chattier and more casual mood than usual today, said he had been warning 
for weeks that ''all politics is local,'' and that he could not transfer his 
popularity to others. He gave other major Republican candidates a hand by 
speaking at their fund-raising receptions and starring in their television ads. 
But he rarely hit the campaign trail with them, which his staff said was not the 
most efficient way for him to help. 

Just a dozen years ago, Mr. Rowland's entire team likely would have been 
elected, since Connecticut's voting machines still had a party lever, which 
allowed voters to choose an entire slate automatically. In a ballot question in 
1986, voters narrowly decided to eliminate the lever. Ironically, the drive to 
have it removed was led by Republicans. 

Regardless of the pain it caused him this week, Mr. Rowland said he still thinks 
it was the right decision. ''A lever is too easy,'' he said. ''We basically were 
saying to people, 'You're not smart enough to pick the candidates of your 
choice.' '' 

One statewide race remained undecided tonight, although Mr. Rowland said he had 
been told that the Republican incumbent had lost. The State Treasurer, Paul J. 
Silvester, was deadlocked at 49 percent with his Democratic challenger, Denise 
Nappier, who was ahead by 1,670 votes in the unofficial tally by The Associated 
Press. A spokesman for the Secretary of the State's office said an official 
result would be released Thursday, when a decision would be made about a 
recount. 

United States Senator Christopher J. Dodd, a Democrat who defeated his 
Republican challenger, Gary A. Franks, by 33 percentage points, said he would 
leave it to others to judge whether it was his coattails that pulled in so many 
Democrats. ''While the Governor is a good campaigner and had a strong campaign, I 
believe our candidates for these other offices were better and stronger 
candidates'' than the Republicans, Mr. Dodd said. 

One Democratic strategist said the Campaign for Connecticut Families made an 
agonizing choice that helps explain Mr. Rowland's dearth of coattails. Through 
telephone calls and mailings, the group identified many voters who planned to 
vote for Mr. Rowland, but would support Democrats for the offices on the ballot. 


''We faced a difficult decision: Do you turn out those voters?'' the 
strategistsaid. This can be done by phoning people just before the election and 
offering them rides to the polls. 

So the choice boiled down to whether to sacrifice votes for Mrs. Kennelly to 
help elect other Democrats, the strategist said. In many towns where legislative 
races were tight, the Democrats decided that because Mrs. Kennelly's campaign 
was not competitive, they should try to turn out the Democratic supporters of 
Mr. Rowland. That decision, the strategist said, helped Ms. Nappier. 

While others huddled for post-mortems, Mr. Rowland, 41, celebrated his victory 
today by heading off for vacation at a warm but otherwise unspecified 
destination with his wife, Patty. Before he left, he made what has become his 
traditional post-election stop at a metal-molding plant here. Scores of 
delighted workers crowded around, to get a glimpse of the Governor, who was 
wearing pleated-front Dockers and a forest-green, cable-knit sweater. 

An exit poll of 1,459 Connecticut voters by Voter News Service showed the 
breadth and depth of Mr. Rowland's victory. There was little gender gap: he got 
64 percent of men's votes and 61 percent of women's. He won in nearly every 
category of voters except blacks, liberals and Democrats -- and even 45 percent 
of blacks and 38 percent of Democrats voted for him. 

Voters began splitting their tickets, however, when it came to races for the 
State Senate, where Republicans needed to pick up just two seats to regain 
control of the chamber. Democratic leaders in the State Senate held a news 
conference today to trumpet the preservation of their 19-to-17 majority. The 
Majority Leader, Senator George C. Jepsen, needled the Governor for his 
ever-more-moderate position on issues. ''We are delighted Governor Rowland chose 
in the last year to basically adopt the Democratic agenda,'' Senator Jepsen said. 
The Senate President Pro Tempore, Kevin B. Sullivan, added, ''I expect he would 
continue to work with us, continue to follow our lead.'' 

Mr. Rowland did not take the bait, but simply said he was looking forward to 
continuing to work with the Legislature's leaders. ''A few days from now, 
everybody catches their breath and the campaign fades away and we realize we've 
got to do a budget, and we've got a legislative session starting up in a couple 
months,'' he said. ''We put on our game gear and off we go.'' 

Several defeated Republicans said they did not blame Mr. Rowland for their loss. 
Nevertheless, his lack of coattails gave Democrats a rare chance to gloat in a 
year when the Governor has dominated the political landscape. ''He wasn't wearing 
a coat,'' said Susan Bysiewicz, a Democrat who was elected Secretary of the 
State. ''He was wearing a vest.''
