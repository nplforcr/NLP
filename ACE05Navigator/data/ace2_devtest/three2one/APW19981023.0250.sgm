HONG KONG (AP) _ Prices on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange closed
sharply higher in moderate trading Friday.
The blue-chip Hang Seng Index rose 159.17 points, or 1.6
percent, to 9,817.75. On Friday, the index had slipped 3.54 points.
Turnover amounted to 6.89 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
883 million), up from 5.69 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 729
million).
Brokers said share prices slumped in the morning session on
profit-taking following recent sharp gains. The key index has
gained 25 percent so far this month.
Prices rebounded late in the afternoon due to futures-related
buying, they said.
Meanwhile, the Hong Kong Association of Banks did not announce
any further cuts in interest rates at its weekly meeting on Friday.
Last week, local banks announced a 0.25 percentage point cut in
interest rates.
Among properties, Cheung Kong rose 1.50 Hong Kong dollars to
50.50, and Sun Hung Kai Properties rose 1.30 dollars to 45.00.
In the banking sector, Hang Seng Bank rose 1.75 dollars to
66.75, and HSBC Holdings rose 1.50 dollars to 182.00.
Elsewhere, Hutchison Whampoa rose 1.10 dollars to 51.00, and
Hong Kong Telecom rose 10 cents to 15.60.
