Washington is reportedly formulating a new and more aggressive military
strategy to counter any attack on South Korea by troops from the Communist
north. A military advance from the south would be met with a full scale
invasion of the North. Senior U.S. officials are quoted in the "Far Eastern

South Korea still have to approve the revised strategy.
