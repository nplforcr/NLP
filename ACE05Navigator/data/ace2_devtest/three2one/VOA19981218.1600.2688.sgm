and
in other news, the US House of Representatives holds a historic debate on
whether to impeach President Clinton. Right now let us go to the well of
the House of Representatives where Representative Dennis Kasich from Ohio a
Democrat is now speaking.

and this nation with a low rent impeachment. There is much misunderstanding
about just what impeachment means. It is not a form of censure. Impeachment
is not a punishment. It is part of a process for removing a president. It
has been reserved for the highest crimes, not low crimes. I submit if we
are to impeach President Clinton for his offenses, we will have committed
an offense more grievous because we will have nullified the votes of 97
million Americans. Don't take away the people's voice. Don't nullify the
people's choice. Punish the President with censure if you must, but don't
punish the American people by canceling their vote. Someday a generation
far into the future will look at this moment and ask why. They will
conclude that in impeaching a president, this House chose partisanship
under the rule of patriotism and sanctimonious salutations to that all
hallowed and selectively perceived rule of law and that cloak of shame
prepared for the President will also cover those carrying the cloak. For
this moment, we are troubling our America. We are troubling our common
bond. We are troubling our American community. We are troubling our
American unity. The sun will rise and the year 2000 will soon come and
those who have troubled their house will have inherited the wind.

Mr. Speaker, this is a totally prejudged and partisan process that denies
the majority of the members of this House of Representatives and the
majority of Americans a vote on a bipartisan compromise, a vote of
conscience to censure the President. Mr. Speaker, the American people in
their collective electoral wisdom that we all...

You are listening to debate coming to you from the well of the House of
Representatives. Debate on whether or not to impeach President William
Jefferson Clinton. The first time an impeachment of a president would have
happened in 130 years. Right now we are listening to Representative John
Olver, a Democrat from Massachusetts.

no grounds for impeachment. No such thing appears in the Starr Report.
Instead I found evidence gathered at great public cost in dollars, $50
million, and in destruction of privacy that Americans cherish evidence of a
consensual sexual relationship of the tawdriest nature which the
participants tried to hide for its tawdriness. Weeks of Judiciary Committee
hearings have uncovered nothing more except the partisan closed mindedness
of the proceedings. The Republicans obsession to impeach President Clinton
on the flimsiest of constitution grounds and against the will of most
Americans will cause long lasting divisions in America. The Republicans
know that they cannot get 67 votes in the Senate to remove the President
from office, so this is a purely partisan exercise in this House designed
to humiliate and weaken the twice elected President of the United States.
Fifteen seconds more please, Mr. Chairman.

I am pleased to grant the gentleman 15 additional seconds.

To my Republican colleagues, by your efforts today you show the American
people once and for all that you should not be in the majority in this
Congress and that I believe will be your reward.

That is right. Voting will take place tomorrow, Saturday, at the House of
Representatives. After the House has made their vote, President Clinton
will make an address and the Voice of America will broadcast that address
as it happens.
