Egypt's foreign minister has completed a lightning round of
shuttle diplomacy between Turkey and Syria and says he now has hopes their
dispute will not erupt into open conflict. Amre Moussa met early Monday
with Turkish leaders to relay a Syrian message, then flew to Syria with
Turkey's response. In Turkey, foreign minister Ismail Cem says it appears
that Syria may be moving toward meeting Turkish demands that it stop
supporting Turkish Kurd rebels. But Mr. Cem said Syrian action is more
important than words. Syria has denied supporting the rebels, but Turkey
rejects the denial.
