Getting ready is much easier said than done.
To make changes in a big company or a city's computer system involves
months of scanning through millions of lines of computer code.
Is there any reason to be optimistic at all?
The thing about the computer is, you can have a problem in one part of the
world and fix it in another.
ABC's Mark Litke reports from Madras, India.

Make your way through the clogged streets of old Madras, past the
factory making shirts for the gap, and you've reached the future.
This is the tata company, the largest of more than 100 Indian firms now
working around the clock to slay the millennium bug, and doing battle for a
who's who of American corporations -- Boeing, American express, GE,
Prudential, Hewlett-Packard and many more.
Why turn to India?
<TURN>
Size is import, number of people, infrastructure, the computing equipment.

<ANNOTATION> Reporter: </ANNOTATION>
And you've got it all here?
<TURN>
Yeah.

As with the millennium bug itself, it's in the numbers.
India's advantage, it simply has more skilled, English-speaking programmers
than any other country outside the U.S. most are still trained in the early
computer languages needed to fix old computer codes.
And they work for one-tenth the wages of programmers in the west.
Would the west solve this problem without India?
<TURN>
I don't believe so.
Not now and not quickly.

Despite the fact that half this country's nearly 1 billion people
still can't read or write, India is one of the world's most
computer-literate societies.
In many public schools here, children get hands-on computer education from
the earliest grades.
There are also thousands of private schools, mostly small storefront
operations.

In India, Microsoft chief Bill Gates is a superstar.
Jim Thomas left IBM to work for the tata company.

The quality that's coming out of software from India now is exceeding the
quality coming out of software from the United States.
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> Reporter: </ANNOTATION>
While that point is debatable, there's no argument that with
millions of lines of computer code still to be scanned for the year 2000
fix, a country seemingly mired in the last century is now vital for
overcoming the first big hurdle of the next century.
