A U.S. federal appeals court has cleared the way for a Canadian convict to
be executed in Texas. Joseph Stanley Falder, who murdered a 75-year-old
Texas widow in 1975, isn't due to be put to death tonight. If the execution
goes ahead, he will be the first Canadian put to death in the U.S. in 46
years. This is THE WORLD.
