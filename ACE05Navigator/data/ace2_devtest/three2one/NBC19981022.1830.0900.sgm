As many young athletes strive to reach the pinnacle of their sport, their
parents often are a source of strength, a refuge in a competitive world.
But sometimes, parents go too far.
Joan Ryan, a columnist for "the San Francisco chronicle," wrote a book
called "little girls in pretty boxes: the making and breaking of elite
gymnasts and figure skaters."
Tonight, Joan Ryan, "in her own words."
<TURN>
In gymnastics, figure skating, tennis, these sports in which young girls
can be the best in the world at a young age, the parents shift somehow and
become the exploiters.
Somewhere along the line the girl's inner drive gets shifted to the parents
and the parents take hold of this dream.
What started out as fun and just a love for this sport becomes a job for
these girls.
They understand that their parents have not really been behaving as
parents.
They haven't been the protectors and the nurturers that we expect of
parents.
They are putting in 35 to 50 hours a week at the ages of 12, 13, 14, 15
years old.
It's a job and child labor laws should apply.
What I hope is that a kid can go to their parent and say, "I'm feeling like
this is more important to you than it is to me.
I'm feeling like you've co-opted my dream."
And so I'm hoping that what Dominique does will have a ripple effect for a
Lot of kids.
