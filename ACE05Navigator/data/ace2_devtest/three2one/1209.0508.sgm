HEADLINE:  Oregon's Gay Workers Given Benefits for Domestic Partners   
</HEADER>
<TEXT>
 
In the first ruling of its kind, an appeals court in Oregon ruled yesterday that 
the State Constitution gave homosexual government employees the right to health 
and life insurance benefits for their domestic partners. 

''This is, to my knowledge, the first time a court has said it's unconstitutional 
not to give benefits to the domestic partners of gay and lesbian employees,'' 
said Matt Coles, director of the Lesbian and Gay Rights Project at the American 
Civil Liberties Union. ''And there is no state in the country that provides 
domestic partner benefits to all government employees.'' 

But Oregon does already provide benefits to the domestic partners of its 
employees: while the case was on appeal, the state voluntarily began offering 
such benefits to its direct employees. The employer of the three lesbian 
plaintiffs in the case, Oregon Health Sciences University, has also voluntarily 
begun offering such benefits, although it is no longer part of the state, but a 
separate public corporation. 

While the ruling today involved only that university, Mr. Coles said, the 
decision would apply to every employee of a governmental entity in Oregon, 
expanding the benefits to thousands of teachers, police officers and others who 
work for local government. 

Robert B. Rocklin, the assistant attorney general who argued the case, said he 
was not so sure. 

''I don't know yet if we'll appeal, and it's hard to say exactly what the impact 
of the ruling would be,'' Mr. Rocklin said. ''The court dismissed the state 
defendants because O.H.S.U. is no longer a state entity. It's not completely 
clear to me whether it would apply to all government employees in the state.'' 

The ruling, by a three-judge panel of the State Court of Appeals, upheld a 1996 
trial ruling in the case, finding that the denial of benefits to the three 
plaintiffs, all nursing professionals in long-term relationships who had applied 
for medical and dental insurance for their partners in 1991, violated a section 
of the State Constitution similar to the Equal Protection clause of the 14th 
Amendment of the United States Constitution. 

In a provision that is echoed in other states, the Oregon Constitution provides 
that ''no law shall be passed granting to any citizen or class of citizens 
privileges or immunities, which, upon the same terms, shall not equally belong 
to all citizens.'' 

The three lesbian couples said they were members of a class of citizens, 
homosexual couples, that was being denied the privilege of insurance benefits. 

The university argued that it was not discriminating against the class of 
homosexuals, since it denied insurance benefits to the unmarried partners of all 
employees, heterosexual and homosexual alike. 

''That reasoning misses the point, however,'' the court said. ''Homosexual couples 
may not marry. Accordingly, the benefits are not made available on equal terms. 
They are made available on terms that, for gay and lesbian couples, are a legal 
impossibility.'' 

In recent years, many private companies and local governments have voluntarily 
decided to offer benefits to domestic partners. And New York and Vermont, like 
Oregon, provide benefits to domestic partners of their own workers, but not to 
those who work for local or county governments. 

While the Oregon case is apparently the first in which courts have ordered such 
benefits, as a constitutional matter, several courts, in New Jersey and 
elsewhere, have rejected the kind of argument that prevailed in Oregon. 

''This is still a new area of law, and there's a similar case pending in 
Pittsburgh,'' Mr. Coles said. ''But when I look at this decision, I think what a 
difference a decade makes.''
