Deputy Chief Jane Perlov, who was the first woman to command a borough's 
detectives in the New York Police Department, will leave the city next month to 
take the highest-ranking public safety job in Massachusetts, officials announced 
yesterday. 

Chief Perlov's appointment as Public Safety Secretary was announced at a news 
conference in Boston yesterday by Acting Gov. Argeo Paul Cellucci. In a 
telephone interview last night, Chief Perlov, 42, said she had a ''heavy heart'' 
about leaving the New York Police Department, but called the chance to join 
Governor Cellucci's cabinet an ''incredible honor'' that was too good to pass up. 
In her new position she will oversee 20 public safety agencies in Massachusetts 
and have the opportunity to shape legislation in the state. 

''That's a wonderful thing for someone who's been a career police officer,'' she 
said. 

Chief Perlov joined the Police Department in 1981, quickly rising through the 
ranks to become a captain and the first woman to command the 20th Precinct, 
which covers the Upper West Side. In 1995, she was promoted to inspector and 
tapped to lead the 30th Precinct in Harlem, which had been rocked by one of the 
worst police corruption scandals in the city's history. 

Last December, she was named the commanding officer of Queens detectives, making 
her the first female detective commander and among the department's 
highest-ranking women. 

Chief Perlov, who is married to a police sergeant, was born in Bayside, Queens, 
and moved to Central Park West with her family as a teen-ager. The second of 
three daughters born to a financial analyst and a manager, she was encouraged by 
her parents to become a doctor or a lawyer. Instead, she became a police officer 
-- the first in her family. 

Her mother cried the day she graduated from the Police Academy, but yesterday, 
Chief Perlov said, her mother was ''incredibly proud -- she's busting.'' Then 
again, she said, ''she's been busting for years now.''
