Chartering a plane for a business trip may sound extravagant.
In some cases, it can be the best deal.
Dan Ronan explains in this edition of "working ahead."

Microtel chairman Mike leven is going to work.
Today he's headed to Georgetown, Kentucky, to oversee the grand opening of
the franchise company's 100th hotel.
<TURN>
Okay.
All right.
<TURN>
Yeah.
<ANNOTATION> applause </ANNOTATION>

Leven is based in Atlanta.
Georgetown has an airport.
But there's no scheduled commercial jet service.
The solution, charter a plane to fly him and his staff in for the day.
<TURN>
Commercial doesn't go to some of the places we have to go.
If it -- if commercial does go, sometimes the schedule doesn't work.
Often times now it's very close to the same price if you're taking a lot of
people because commercial fares have gone up for business travelers so
much.

<ANNOTATION> Reporter: </ANNOTATION>
The cost of flying this charter plane is about $3,000 a day.
If you were to fly all of the passengers on a commercial jet in first
class, it would be a little less.
Still, if you pay for the charter with a charge card, you'd accumulate
frequent-flier miles.
There are nearly 700 airports in the U.S. that can handle commercial jets.
But there are nearly 5,500 smaller facilities for general aviation.
More companies are finding that, with crowded airports and tight schedules,
flying on a charter makes economic sense and improves morale.
<TURN>
It's not an extravagance, it's as a necessity of business today.
And in fact, 84% of the people who fly on corporate jets are not the top
management.
They're engineering teams, they're people who are traveling in order to get
to a factory or something like that.
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> Reporter: </ANNOTATION>
Leven and his team would spend about two hours in Kentucky,
meeting with hotel investors, employees and residents.
The time in the air makes them more efficient.
<TURN>
Generally, I will take two, three or four people with me on one of these
trips.
We usually hold a meeting on the plane.
It's a casual, more relaxed atmosphere.
You certainly can't do that on a commercial airline.
So you are using the time that you're in the air to conduct business.
<TURN>
<ANNOTATION> Reporter: </ANNOTATION>
But this CEO flies regular commercial flights when that is more
cost-effective, as he did this day, catching a flight from Cincinnati to
Boston.
