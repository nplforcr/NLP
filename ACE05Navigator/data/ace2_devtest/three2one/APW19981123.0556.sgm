MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The Spanish hotel giant Sol Melia announced
Monday it will merge its various units to create a hotel group it
said will be the world's ninth largest.
Sol Melia, owned by the Escarrer family, will fully absorb Melia
Inversiones Americanas, which specializes in Latin America and the
Caribbean, and the family's private hotel-construction business
Inmotel.
Sol Melia, Spain's largest hotel management company, operates
more than 250 hotels and handles some 65,000 rooms in 25 countries.
Founded by Gabriel Escarrer in 1956 with the first Sol Hotel, it
became the center of his family's hotel empire.
``The integration of the three companies into one will provide
greater financial stability that will allow us to maximize
opportunities for future growth and have a leading position in the
world,'' Escarrer, the company's chairman, said in a press release
Monday.
The merger operation will be concluded in the first quarter of
1999 and will reduce company costs.
