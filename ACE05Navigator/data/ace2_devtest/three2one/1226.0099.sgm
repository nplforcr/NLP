AS we enter what is popularly regarded as the last year of this century (not to 
mention this millennium), it doesn't hurt to draw perspective from someone who 
lived in the last century. 

Florence Adamson -- ''not Flo, or Flossie, it's been Florence all my life,'' she 
says with determined dignity -- was born Jan. 4, 1895, into a world without 
movies, airplanes, income taxes, the World Series and Mother's Day. She was 50 
when television emerged and 80 when the first personal computer was sold. 

Yet all the progress during her 103 years, all the epic events, seem to amount 
to so much historical bric-a-brac when Mrs. Adamson reflects on her life, 
sitting in her mahogany and floral-print room in The Osborn, a top-drawer home 
for the elderly here. Nothing mattered more than the family she grew up with, on 
Manhattan's East 21st Street, and the family she raised in two affluent 
Westchester towns. 

''It was a very sedate world,'' she said, sitting in an armchair surrounded by 
family photographs, a walker nearby on which her prim handbag dangled. ''It was 
our home life that was a big thing. My mother was a professional singer and I 
took piano lessons to accompany her. We had an Edison gramophone. We loved 
music. 

''I can remember going to Stuyvesant Park with a roller hoop and roller skates. 
Mother took my brothers and me every good afternoon. We were outdoors. The park 
was not crowded. It was delightful.'' 

Mrs. Adamson, whose cheerful, under-five-foot presence is strengthened by soft 
blue eyes and spun-silver hair, raised three daughters who gave her 
grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and great-great-grandchildren in numbers she 
cannot count. ''It's hard to keep track,'' she jokes. ''I'm lucky I can keep track 
of myself.'' 

The Depression forced her to move to a smaller house. The two world wars caused 
some turbulence. But most great events had the quality of distant storms, 
sometimes scaring her, mostly sparing her, but nothing she could do much about. 

''The world just took care of itself, and I had my family to take care of,'' she 
said. 

The person in the 20th century who most impressed her? ''It might have been the 
organist in the church I belonged to,'' she said. ''He was a fine person, nicely 
educated, treated us well, and taught us music and nice manners.'' 

The organist? What about Franklin Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, Martin Luther 
King? 

''I just let them take care of themselves,'' she says. 

Getting such answers from a 100-year-old person reminds one of those interviews 
with Mel Brooks as the 2,000-year-old man. The greatest invention, the old man 
concluded, was Saran Wrap. The greatest writer? It wasn't Shakespeare. ''With an 
L that looked like a T, an M that looked like an N. He had the worst penmanship 
I ever saw.'' 

The very old, particularly if they have led comfortable lives, have the luxury 
of forgetting that in the 20th century women got to vote and compete in the 
workplace, blacks gained access to schools and jobs, medicine made it possible 
for people like Mrs. Adamson to live to 100. (Her secret for health is not the 
2,000-year-old man's nectarine but a sherry now and then.) 

But her take on the century is that emotional connections matter more than all 
the hoopla historians pay attention to. Nothing gave her more happiness than 
marriage to Seth Adamson and nothing devastated her as much as his death at 62. 
''He was playing golf on the Sunday,'' she said. ''Monday he has a heart attack. 
Sunday he's dead.'' 

''I have an old-fashioned theory,'' she said. ''Any woman that is loved very much 
by the right man has the world right at her fingertips. It makes for a happy 
home. It makes for happy children.'' 

Mrs. Adamson is no Luddite. She appreciates the telephone that brings calls from 
her progeny, the television that brings her ''Jeopardy.'' But she also seems to 
believe that many of our conveniences, much of our consuming need for news and 
entertainment, are distractions from life's bedrock pleasures. In her life, it 
was civility and companionship that proved enduring. 

''No matter what the year is, no matter what the season, if you have that, you've 
got the whole works,'' she said.
