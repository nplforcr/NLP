bern , switzerland -lrb- ap -rrb- _ switzerland 's telephone company swisscom said sunday it has adjusted its books to reflect 942 million swiss francs -lrb- dlrs 725 million -rrb- in shrunken values of investments in asia and eastern europe . spokesman werner nuber said the company had long since informed swiss authorities of the downward adjustments to the value of its assets over three years , reported earlier sunday by the weekly sonntagsblick . the main investments affected include those in the european unisource alliance , which it has shared with at and t , dutch and swedish partners ; malaysia 's mutiara telecom ; and india 's aircel digilink , the company said . but swisscom said it still regards its investments in the turbulent markets as having long-term promise despite problems from 1995 through 1997 . the government-controlled swisscom , formerly the telecommunications arm of switzerland 's postal service , has begun selling shares to the public , with an initial offering of about 30 percent of the firm 's share capital earlier this month . nuber refused to characterize the writeoffs as losses and rejected comparisons with ubs , switzerland 's and europe 's largest bank . last month ubs said market turmoil would cause it an after-tax loss of up to 1 billion francs -lrb- then dlrs 720 million -rrb- in the third quarter of 1998 .
