moscow -lrb- ap -rrb- _ since winning re-election in 1996 , boris yeltsin has been on a two-year losing streak . his shaky health has become a national obsession and keeps him away from the kremlin for days , and sometimes weeks , at a time . the economy is suffering through its worst breakdown in the post-soviet era , but he rarely raises the subject and has n't even hinted at a recovery plan . even if he did , a growing band of critics argues , he 's too weak physically and politically to launch any ambitious reforms before his term ends in 2000 . always eager to show he 's still in charge , yeltsin has fired the entire government twice this year . but to what end ? the new government , led by prime minister yevgeny primakov , is a mishmash of politicians from various groups who are struggling to put together a coherent economic program yeltsin , 67 , brushes aside worries about his health and says there is no chance he will quit before his term ends . the russian constitution makes impeachment an unlikely option , yet the clamor for yeltsin 's resignation is louder than it 's ever been . `` every one of his public events is painful to watch , '' said andrei piontkovsky , a political analyst and harsh critic of the president . `` he 's out of touch . the state of his health and the state of mind are deplorable . '' several leading russian newspapers have urged yeltsin to step down . they freely speculate about whether he has alzheimer 's disease , or a return of heart problems that necessitated quintuple bypass surgery two years ago . yeltsin 's public approval rating is in the single digits , but the president 's hard-line foes have had difficulty turning this disenchantment into mass support . protests around the country on oct. 7 drew about 1 million marchers , but the crowds were much smaller than predicted and have not resulted in any sustained labor unrest . still , the president is losing support from traditionally friendly camps . `` temporary incapacity is one thing , but if a person can not work and permanently perform his functions , he should muster the will and courage to say that , '' moscow mayor luzhkov said friday . `` everything now depends on the president himself . '' luzhkov , a likely presidential contender in 2000 , has been an ally of yeltsin and has never before openly questioned the president 's health or his ability to govern . yeltsin normally relishes a good fight and is at his best at times of confrontation . yet he has responded to the economic crisis by keeping a profile so low it borders on reclusive . he spends most days at a country residence to the west of moscow , venturing into the kremlin perhaps two or three times a week , and then only for a few hours . most public appearances are carefully controlled meetings in his kremlin office , where he chitchats with government officials briefly for the benefit of the camera . last week 's trip to central asia was his first foreign journey in five months , and it proved a public relations disaster . yeltsin almost fell at a red carpet ceremony in uzbekistan . he canceled meetings , cut short a news conference and headed home a day early with a respiratory infection . he has called off a trip to a summit in malaysia next month , and government sources said one reason was concern about the effects of the long flight on his health . if yeltsin were to resign _ an unlikely scenario at this point _ then primakov would take over as president temporarily and a presidential election would be held within three months . the leading contenders would be luzhkov , former security chief alexander lebed and communist party leader gennady zyuganov . to some , the signs of a campaign are already visible . `` it seems to me we are already in the middle of a new presidential race , '' said piontkovsky , the analyst .
