brooks brothers is getting into the wine business . but please , hold the jokes about buttoned-down merlot and pinstriped chardonnay . as many charge customers of the venerable haberdasher already know -lrb- a brochure went out recently with the monthly bills -rrb- , the new venture is called brooks brothers cellar , and it is strictly a mail-order business . so no , you wo n't be able to drop into your nearest brooks brothers store for a pair of socks and an '82 latour . it works like this : send brooks brothers cellar $ 30 a month , plus shipping , and it will send you two bottles of wine . subscriptions , if that 's the appropriate word , are for three , six or 12 months . the 180-year-old company is moving into wine cautiously . the program is available in only three states , new york , new jersey and massachusetts , but there are plans to expand it to about 20 other states that permit selling wine by mail . brooks brothers cellar is the latest in a series of moves by the clothier to attract a newer , younger clientele and update its image while taking advantage of its famous name . the company recently licensed its name to a line of eyewear . `` brooks brothers is a slumbering giant , '' said barbara barry , a los angeles designer hired to polish the company image . as paul gitter , the brooks brothers executive overseeing the wine program , put it : `` this is a life-style brand . it has immense possibilities , and we plan to exploit them all . '' wine clubs like this one are not new . windsor vineyards , a subsidiary of rodney strong vineyards in windsor , calif. , in sonoma county , has sold wine by mail for more than 30 years . windsor sells only its own wines , generally priced at $ 9 to $ 20 . its specialty is personalizing the labels for weddings and birthdays . mail-order wine is billed as a bargain but rarely is , if for no other reason than that the customer must pay shipping charges . money-saving claims are difficult to back up because many of the labels are obscure or unknown . knowledgeable customers can usually do just as well or better in wine shops . wine by mail rarely attracts savvy customers . while some wine-club clients prefer mail-order wine because of the convenience or because they have no good wine shops nearby , others are attracted to it because they know little about wine and prefer having someone else select it for them . brooks brothers cellar subscribers can order two bottles of wine a month for a minimum of three months for a total of $ 90 , or $ 15 a bottle . the shipping charge , $ 6.95 a month , will be waived for the first month for the store 's charge-card holders . members can select the color of their wines _ all red , all white or a mixed order of red and white _ but not the wines themselves . no need for concern , brooks brothers says . its brochure assures that `` these are wines to remember ; full-bodied , crisp , or classic . '' how does a clothing business come to address its customers in wine jargon ? it hires someone else to do the job . brooks brothers ' program is run by geerlings andamp ; wade , a 20-year-old direct marketer of wine and wine-associated products in canton , mass. , near boston . geerlings andamp ; wade sells directly to most of its customers , attracting them to its own wine club through brochures , catalogs and telephone sales . it has also run programs like the one it has set up for brooks brothers . `` we 've done them for century 21 and the brookstone chain , '' said jay essa , the president and chief executive , referring to the real estate company and the catalog and retail concern . geerlings andamp ; wade 's own customers can buy its wines only in six - and 12-bottle cases . prices range from as little as $ 7 a bottle to as much as $ 80 for a wide variety of domestic and imported wines . the more expensive labels often bear familiar names like joseph phelps , the napa valley winery , and the hospice de beaune in burgundy , but the lower-priced wines often have little-known or unknown names . in fact , geerlings andamp ; wade owns more than 20 names , which it uses on domestic wines it buys at low prices in the california bulk-wine market . its customers can be excused for being confused by names like glass ridge , j. krant cellars , lapis lazuli winery and vineyards , rose valley and st. carolyne winery . these places do n't exist ; they are brand names geerlings andamp ; wade can use as it sees fit . should brooks brothers cellar members be more demanding , geerlings andamp ; wade will almost certainly be ready to oblige them . its current catalog offers fine bordeaux like chateau clerc milon and california cabernets like joseph phelps ' insignia at prices up to $ 840 a case , about what they cost in retail shops . brooks brothers is entering wine by mail at a time when the business is under broad attack from part of the wine trade and from the government . wine sales are regulated by a bewildering array of laws that vary from state to state but generally require winemakers and importers to sell only to licensed distributors , who are then required to sell only to licensed retailers . direct-mail operators are accused of bypassing this three-tiered system and also of avoiding state taxes the distributors must pay . wine distributors are solidly opposed to any form of wine by mail and , under pressure from them , many states have been tightening the rules . geerlings andamp ; wade says it conforms to the system by holding retail licenses for warehouses in 14 states that are supplied by licensed distributors . it collects taxes in all states where the law requires it to , essa said . `` we 're confident that we 're in compliance with the laws wherever we operate , '' he added . but brooks brothers ' principal concern is , of course , customer response to an untried venture . if it works , buttoned-down merlot may not be so far-fetched after all .
