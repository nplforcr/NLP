arusha , tanzania -lrb- ap -rrb- _ a u.n. court on friday ordered a former rwandan mayor to serve three life sentences for convictions of genocide and crimes against humanity , plus 80 years for other violations including rape . in the first judgment by an international court on genocide , jean-paul akayesu was convicted sept. 2 of nine counts of genocide , crimes against humanity and rape . akayesu had made an impassioned plea monday for forgiveness from the rwandan people for the genocide of more than 500,000 people , mostly minority tutsis , in 1994 . however , judge laity kama said friday akayesu `` chose to participate in the genocide , '' and should therefore spend the rest of his life in prison , according to the swiss-based hirondelle news agency . `` the chamber is of the opinion ... that genocide constitutes the crime of crimes , '' kama told the court . akayesu was ordered to serve the sentences concurrently , which means he will serve a single life sentence . akayesu stood silently , showing no emotion as the sentence was read . the international criminal tribunal for rwanda was formed in november 1994 , months after an extremist hutu government sponsored the 90-day slaughter . the genocide ended only when tutsi-led rebels took power in july 1994 . akayesu , who was born in 1953 , was mayor of the central village of taba where 2,000 tutsis who sought his protection were killed . he has maintained his innocence , claiming he was unable to stop the slaughter . acting in his own defense during his pre-sentencing hearing monday , akayesu said remorsefully , `` i regret what happened from the bottom of my heart . '' he also asked for god 's forgiveness , hirondelle reported . prosecutor pierre prosper called the former mayor a predator and asked for seven life sentences plus additional lesser sentences for other crimes . he later said he was satisfied with akayesu 's life sentence , the maximum penalty the u.n. tribunal can impose . akayesu has appealed his convictions , hirondelle reported . the tribunal , in akayesu 's precedent-setting judgment , had ruled that rape and sexual violence were brutally wielded as tools of genocide in rwanda in 1994 . no one accused akayesu personally of rape , but many witnesses said he incited the sexual abuse of tutsi women . he was sentenced to 15 years for rape . during the 20-month trial , akayesu fired his defense team three times , most recently on monday , and has represented himself on several occasions . the tribunal is holding 31 people in arusha . another person is in custody in texas . friday 's sentencing was the tribunal 's second . ex-prime minister jean kambanda , 42 , pleaded guilty in may and was sentenced to life imprisonment on sept. 4 . rwandan courts have tried at least 330 people in the genocide , and 116 have been sentenced to death . a total of 126,078 people are imprisoned and awaiting trial , according to the red cross . on april 24 , the rwandan government executed 22 genocide convicts by firing squad , the first executions for the slaughter . at the yugoslav tribunal , two men have received sentences , but neither was for genocide . all those accused in the post-world war ii nuremberg trials pleaded innocent to charges including murder and extermination . the trials predated the establishment of the crime of genocide 50 years ago .
