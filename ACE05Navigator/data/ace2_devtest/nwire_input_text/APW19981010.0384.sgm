khartoum , sudan -lrb- ap -rrb- _ a rebel decision to unilaterally extend a cease-fire by three months is only a pretext to cover troop movements and training , sudan 's army spokesman was quoted as saying saturday . `` we in the armed forces believe the cease-fire will benefit the rebellion movement '' because the rebels will use the time to prepare for future combats , lt. gen. abdul-rahman sirul-khatim said in an interview with the daily al-rai al-akher . the rebel sudan people 's liberation army said thursday that it will extend by another three months the current three-month cease-fire when it end wednesday to allow relief food to reach civilians in war provinces like bahr el-ghazal in the south . khartoum has not officially responded to the announcement , and sirul-khatim 's comments are the first from a government official on the cease-fire . sirul-khatim , however , indicated that the `` government has its position on this -lrb- cease-fire -rrb- . '' sudan has been embroiled in a civil war for 15 years with christian and animist rebels fighting for more autonomy from the muslim , arab north . about 1.5 million people have died in the war and related famines caused by food and medical supplies being held up by the fighting .
