new york -lrb- ap -rrb- _ d.c. united coach bruce arena is the leading candidate for the u.s. national team job and likely will be offered the position after the major league soccer championship game , u.s. federation secretary general hank steinbrecher said thursday . `` we will not do anything during mls , '' steinbrecher said from the ussf 's chicago headquarters . `` bruce is certainly the leading candidate with carlos queiroz having pulled out . `` after the -lrb- mls -rrb- cup , we 'll approach bruce perhaps about coaching our team . we intend to continue our discussions with bruce . i expect an offer will come at the end of mls . '' the mls cup is scheduled for oct. 25 in the rose bowl in pasadena , california , but the united states has friendly against australia nov. 6 in san jose , california . steinbrecher said he was n't sure who would coach the u.s. team for the australia match . `` we do n't know yet , '' steinbrecher said . `` if bruce takes the job , we believe everything can be worked out . if not , a player-coach or an assistant coach will take the team . '' arena repeatedly has refused to comment on media reports and did so again thursday , issuing a statement through the club 's media relations department . `` at the current time i do not wish to make any comments concerning any speculation about my future , '' arena said . `` i have a job and that is coaching d.c. united . i am pleased for all the interest that is being shown about our sport . i would appreciate if the entire subject could be dropped until the appropriate time . '' d.c. united finished off the miami fusion on sunday in their first-round playoff series and begins its best-of-3 eastern conference semifinal series against the columbus crew on sunday . arena and queiroz , the former portuguese national team and current united arab emirates coach , were the leading candidates for the u.s. job . earlier this week , ussf president bob contigulia was to fly to the united arab emirates to meet with queiroz for an interview , but reportedly was told by queiroz not to come if he did n't have an offer in hand . steinbrecher said he spoke to arena earlier this week . `` in general , we had conversations about philosophy , what the job is , what direction the national teams and the federation are going in , '' said steinbrecher , who said he would prefer a long-term contract through the next world cup . d.c. united general manager kevin payne has said he wants arena , who has coached the club to mls ' first two league titles , through the interamerican cup , scheduled for nov. 14 and dec. 5 . the interamerican cup pits the concacaf club champion , d.c. united , against the south american copa libertadores champion , brazil 's vasco da gama , and a victory would be a major credibility boost for both united and the three-year-old mls . both sides have said they were willing to compromise to allow arena to coach both the u.s. team and d.c. united through the end of the interamerican cup . `` we wo n't do anything until the playoffs are over , '' steinbrecher said . `` this is the day the mls needs to shine . we 're not going to do anything to take away from that .
