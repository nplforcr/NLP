lahore , pakistan -lrb- ap -rrb- _ three of pakistan 's top cricket players denied taking money to throw matches when they appeared saturday before a judicial inquiry into allegations of match fixing . leading batsmen saeed anwar and inzamamul haq and spin bowler mushtaq ahmed told the inquiry that they had no links with bookmakers . a judicial inquiry is being held into accusations that senior pakistani cricketers , including two former captains , wasim akram and saleem malik , fixed matches . the accusations were leveled by some of their team mates and australian cricketers . they have denied the charge . anwar said he received two telephone calls from bookmakers who offered him bribes to play poorly during pakistan 's tour of sri lanka in 1994 . `` i refused the offer and reported it to the officials of the cricket board , '' he said . he also said the bookmakers warned him against disclosing the offer . anwar said he also heard rumors that some cricket players had links with bookmakers , but he had no information on that . he also said malik did not offer him a bribe . ahmed , who denied being involved in match fixing , was warned by the judge : `` if you lie , your career will end . '' haq contradicted earlier testimony by team manager intikhab alam that he had the players swear on the koran _ the muslim holy book _ that they would not throw the matches during a foreign tour . the judge ordered haq to return to give more testimony on nov. 11 . earlier this month australian captain mark taylor and mark waugh appeared before the tribunal to record their statements . waugh told the court he was offered thousands of dollars by malik which he turned down .
