cedar rapids , iowa _ this is crunch time in the 1998 campaign season , and no democrat is likely to be hammering republicans around the country more extensively than vice president al gore in the two weeks remaining before the nov. 3 elections . with democrats sensing improved chances and president clinton cutting back his travel to accommodate developments like the middle-east negotiations in wye mills , md. , gore has become the administration 's busiest spokesman on the campaign trail , defending clinton 's policies , criticizing the opposition and raising money . the strategy continued tuesday in illinois and iowa , where the vice president made nine campaign appearances in five cities before flying on to new mexico and california for more speeches over the next two days . between now and the elections , aides say he could visit as many as a dozen states _ more , if clinton stays home . in large measure , gore is focusing on tightly contested house races , or at least those in which a democrat would have a better chance of winning if the turnout were high . and if a democratic candidate for governor needs help , as tom vilsack does in iowa , so much the better . vilsack , a state lawmaker who is challenging jim lightfoot , a republican , to succeed gov. terry branstad , a republican who is retiring , accompanied gore at each of his six stops tuesday in iowa . `` i do n't think we 're going to break any new ground on the issues , '' an aide to gore said . `` the focus now is turnout . we have to bring up the level of enthusiasm , raise the level for grass-roots intensity . we 've made our arguments ; we just have to reinforce them . '' traveling around iowa has an added benefit for gore because , as the probable democratic front-runner to succeed clinton , he can expand his base in the state that holds the first presidential caucuses . it has only been in recent weeks that democrats have found evidence through recent polls that the midterm elections might produce something less than a disaster for them . early predictions that the impeachment inquiry against clinton would cause democrats to lose scores of seats in the house have largely given way to more optimistic expectations , perhaps a loss of fewer than 34 , the historical average for the party in the white house in the sixth year of an administration . part of the reason , gore said at a rally in davenport for bob rush , the democrat challenging rep. jim leach , an 11-term republican incumbent , is that democrats perceive voters as angry that congress spent too much time on the clinton sex scandal at the expense of important legislation . it is not a new thought as part of gore 's standard stump speech , which stresses education , health care and preserving social security . but his expanding emphasis on republican scandal-lust is . in recent days , gore has been refining the core of his criticism with a suggestion that voters should make the impeachment proceedings an election day referendum , a change from several months ago when democrats feared the scandal would bury them in the fall . `` we say , let 's put it to a vote of the american people , '' as gore said in moline , ill. , campaigning for rep. lane evans , an eight-term democrat facing a strong challenge from mark baker , a former television newsman and a republican in his second bid for election .
