the european space agency labored in obscurity for many years , achieving dozens of feats in the heavens that were ignored by most europeans . then , in 1983 , europe 's first astronaut soared into space aboard a shuttle . suddenly , millions of television viewers across the continent were glued to their sets , watching a good-looking european explorer risk life and limb on the high frontier . officials at the agency 's headquarters in paris were ecstatic . eager for more , they quickly got the same religion as their counterparts in america , the national aeronautics and space administration , which long ago had mastered the art of promoting space-age heroism . belatedly , the europeans discovered that public enthusiasm for sending people into space , a venture steeped in risk and danger , drama and the right stuff , was a sure way to win political support for space exploration and its great costs . `` two years ago nobody would have dreamed of actively pursuing this kind of program , '' jacques collet , the head of long-term planning for the european space agency , said shortly after the televised coup prompted the agency to plan dozens of astronaut flights . last week the agency 's officials turned out in force at cape canaveral , fla. , for another lesson in space-agency showmanship as nasa skillfully orchestrated both a high-stakes drama and a world-class nostalgia trip by sending 77-year-old john glenn back into orbit . for glenn 's flight aboard the space shuttle discovery , nasa succeeded in drawing to florida an estimated 250,000 people and one of the largest contingents of journalists (2,500) ever to cover a space launching . but even on slow days , the agency has managed to turn the kennedy space center into a top tourist attraction , with tour buses and souvenir shops , its attendance somewhere behind that of disney world . nasa 's public-affairs and educational arms , with hundreds of employees coast to coast after 40 years of growth , are the envy of other federal agencies . they give tours , publish magazines , set up satellite feeds for television networks , develop course material for teachers , run internet web sites , promote high-tech gadgetry and regularly hustle out astronauts to meet an admiring public . critics say nasa 's celebrity culture and love of the entertainment side of exploration are stifling the more challenging work of sending humans and robotic probes to study distant worlds . `` this is an agency that 's living in the past , '' said alex roland , a former nasa historian who heads the history department at duke university . `` they 're endlessly repeating the apollo formula _ sending up astronauts , taking pictures and then sending them out on lecture tours . '' yet the shuttle flights always have a hefty dose of legitimate science . in this case , it is aging research with glenn , and dozens of other experiments . but science aside , nasa is heavy with television crews and telegenic space voyagers , and it knows exactly how to go about building a political constituency to support its hefty budget , which at $ 13.7 billion this year is down from old heights . so do a growing number of space agencies around the world that are happy to follow the leader and grab onto nasa 's lavish coattails ; the shuttles alone have cost american taxpayers some $ 70 billion so far . last week at cape canaveral , scores of spanish journalists and television crews , as well as the crown prince of spain and other dignitaries , joined in the frenzy to witness the launching not only of glenn but also of spain 's first astronaut , pedro duque , 35 , an engineer from madrid who , according to his nasa biography , enjoys swimming and cycling . `` it 's neat to see everybody jump on the excitement bandwagon , '' said joel wells , a spokesman at the kennedy space center , referring to the journalists , `` and hopefully they 'll stay . '' raising the adrenalin levels of americans can be difficult these days because the public has become so blase , especially since the astronauts do the same old thing _ circle the earth . still , as the glenn extravaganza suggests , the space agency has some innovations likely to jack up the thrills and chills _ if not satisfy critics . as nasa administrator daniel goldin put it delicately in announcing the senator 's flight : the agency is working hard these days not only to benefit but `` inspire people . '' of course , the razzmatazz can backfire . a dozen years ago , the agency wanted to inspire people by enlisting the first private citizen , christa mcauliffe , a high school teacher . among the 2,500 guests nasa invited to the launching of the challenger space shuttle were 112 teacher finalists from the competition , two from each state and territory , who were to fan out afterward to spread the gospel . after tragedy struck , killing all seven astronauts aboard the challenger , glenn joined the experts saying the risks of space flight should bar civilians and celebrities until the shuttle had proven itself more reliable . `` this is not a greyhound bus going from washington to columbus , '' he told reporters . `` this is a research vehicle . '' -lrb- story can end here . optional material follows -rrb- today , convinced that the shuttles are safer , nasa is revamping its star system . when the agency announced the glenn flight in january , it also disclosed that barbara morgan , an elementary school teacher who trained as a backup for the challenger flight , would get a new chance . her astronaut class is to graduate in the year 2000 , after which she will be assigned to a flight and no doubt broadcast lessons to schoolchildren . experts agree that the biggest show on the horizon is the international space station , an outpost bigger than a football field that teams of astronauts are to build , service and repair . the first supply flight for the station 's construction is set for later this month . the endeavor will be extremely dangerous for those sent into orbit , given the station 's size , complexity and all the space walks . the outpost 's size alone makes it a huge target for asteroids and space debris . but given the thrill factor , and nasa 's diplomatic salesmanship , the space station is already an international hit . its 16 participants are belgium , brazil , canada , denmark , france , germany , italy , japan , the netherlands , norway , russia , spain , sweden , switzerland , britain and the united states . most of the countries expect their astronauts to join in a nearly endless series of broadcasts and dramas from space that could start as early as next year as the first modules are assembled in orbit . some critics fear that the $ 50 billion project will cripple more worthy missions , including robotic ones . others fault it as far too timid , arguing that manned missions should push for mars and beyond , perhaps to the jovian moon europa , which shows signs of harboring the solar system 's deepest ocean and perhaps alien life . dr. bruce murray , a scientist at the california institute of technology and president of the planetary society , a private group in pasadena that backs space exploration , disagreed . he said the station , by uniting former enemies and galvanizing worldwide interest , is a potent political and technical first step toward the exploration and colonization of other worlds . nasa 's public-relations campaign , he added , should be no distraction from the serious scientific and technical aims of the shuttle and station programs , nor from legitimate yearnings . `` the drama of humans going away is terribly appealing , '' murray said . `` that 's why there 's all this interest in glenn . he 's going out in space . you ca n't overestimate the significance of that .
