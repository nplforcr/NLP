In the rehearsal hall, the dialogue was sliced tart and true from the life and 
times of Monica S. Lewinsky, with no less than three actresses taking a crack at 
the ultimate ingenue's role in the inescapable national melodrama that has no 
copyright, perchance no ending. 

The actors as much as the audience seemed mesmerized by the hourlong experiment 
at the New Dramatists playhouse, a scene of grand jury inquisition about sex and 
love, pride and President and all the attendant folderol that, inevitably, has 
raised the question of whether this stuff of life can offer something more 
meaningful through the theater. 

''I'm an insecure person,'' declared the first Monica, Culver Casson, reading the 
line of grand jury dialogue most sadly in explaining why she seemed so often to 
be there on those Presidential rope lines. ''I would go early and stand in the 
front.'' 

The second Monica, Emme Shaw, played it far less for pity than with a kind of 
savvy innocence. ''Can you guys call me Monica?'' she suddenly asked the grand 
jury amid all the testimony about gifts and stains and embarrassment. ''I'm just 
25. Please.'' 

And the third Monica, Abigail Rose Revasch, a study in wide-eyed, free-fall 
anxiety, provided a confessional rush in telling of haphazardly falling in love 
with, well, the President of the United States: ''I thought, I thought: he had a 
beautiful soul.'' 

Her spotlighted Monica was all at sea. ''I don't know what the truth is anymore,'' 
she keened. ''I don't know if it's based on him being an actor,'' she said of the 
President, threatening the rehearsal hall, on West 44th Street in Manhattan, 
with a play within the play. 

The strong applause and vigorous audience discussion that followed the reading 
by the band of 10 actors on Wednesday night marked the evening as something more 
than a stunt. It seemed closer to ''a response to this public distress that we're 
in,'' as Todd London, the artistic director, put it in his welcome to New 
Dramatists, which has been developing playwrights for 50 years. 

The evening at least suggested that no plot line is too far-fetched, nor has the 
nation ever been more provoked to catharsis. With her grand jury chorus 
compulsively curious but finally empathetic, the young woman chattily described 
a flirtation suddenly exploding into a huge criminal investigation of the 
President. No less did the performance feature ludicrous moments, the audience 
guffawing at the true-from-life notion of the President on crutches being 
lewdly, hurriedly serviced by the office intern. ''Oh my God, this is so 
embarrassing!'' said Ms. Lewinsky as a helpful grand juror gently coached, ''You 
can close your eyes.'' 

Since the sound of Ms. Lewinsky has not actually been heard in public despite 
all the months of Washington scandal-traipsing, Mr. London rotated three Monicas 
through the dialogue as a sample of the possibilities, and he reduced the grand 
jury to five members. The transition from the enacted scene to the discussion 
among the 75 people in the hall seemed well cued by one compassionate grand 
juror's troubled line to Ms. Lewinsky: ''I can't figure out why you keep going 
after things that aren't free.'' 

Or, as the problem was analyzed by Moira Driscoll, a grand jury actress finally 
speaking for herself: ''She didn't think through the thong moment.'' Far more than 
that famously impulsive display of undergarment, Ms. Lewinsky didn't think many 
things through, the gathering agreed, always wondering why. 

''She definitely wanted to be forgiven and to be loved,'' said Kate Robin, a 
playwright in the audience. ''And she wins! The grand jurors loved her. 

''They offered her a bouquet at the end,'' she noted of their parting gift. ''It 
was because she was so honest.'' 

Instantly, another playwright, Barry Jay Kaplan, disagreed. ''No, no, no,'' he 
said. ''It's because she has spent a lifetime learning how to do that, how to 
please. She's really good at it.'' 

The now familiar Lewinsky Effect swept the audience, the inability by all sorts 
of well-resolved Americans not to discuss the tale even as they pronounce it too 
pathetic for words. 

''What about him?'' came one writer's question about the President, somewhere far 
offstage amid Ms. Lewinsky's predicament. 

''He's not in this scene,'' another professional dismissively replied, savoring 
some of the good lines Ms. Lewinsky gave herself. (''Inherent in a secret is a 
lie.'') 

The evening's director, Sabrina Peck, a specialist in verbatim dialogue drama on 
topics like the Bosnian refugee tragedy, admitted to doubts about the Lewinsky 
tale's gravity. ''We're all disgusted on one level by the whole thing, but maybe 
there's some usefulness,'' she said, finally delighted by the strong audience 
reaction and teased by the advice to ''make the second act Linda Tripp.'' 

Comic relief continued to the closing lines. The audience laughed at the 12-step 
parody in a grand juror's avuncular advice, ''Monica, none of us in this room are 
perfect.'' 

By then the third Monica of the night was weeping in farewell as she was asked 
if she had anything at all to add to her performance. ''I'm sorry, I'm really 
sorry for everything that's happened,'' she apologized. Then, interrupting her 
sobs, she added, ''And I hate Linda Tripp!'' 

Most mercifully, the audience's closing burst of laughter suggested the whole 
thing may prove more of a comedy than a tragedy.
