Hardly anyone realizes it yet. But this country may spend the first months of 
1999 -- as many as six months -- with the President on trial before the Senate. 

For six days a week, under the rules, the 100 senators would be in their seats 
on the floor. Chief Justice William Rehnquist would preside. Congress, the 
President and the Supreme Court would be seriously disabled. 

That is where the right-wing Republicans who are effectively running the 
impeachment process in the House are taking us. Most Americans do not want to go 
there. Indeed, they assume that impeachment is a dead issue. But the House may 
vote next week to impeach the President. How can that be? 

Henry Hyde, who as chairman of the Judiciary Committee is the formal manager of 
the process, is widely respected in the House. Moreover, he has a strong feeling 
for our political institutions. Yet he is driving toward an impeachment that 
would damage the Presidency and arouse public contempt for Congress. Why? 

Some who know Henry Hyde well say that, on partisan issues, he does not like to 
stray from the Republican line. And the line on impeachment is being set by the 
Republican right. With Speaker-to-be Robert Livingston silent, the commanding 
voice is that of Tom DeLay of Texas, the majority whip, a hard-line 
conservative. Other forceful figures are Bill McCollum of Florida and Bob Barr 
of Georgia, who has been demanding President Clinton's impeachment on one ground 
or another for years. 

Many conservatives have a visceral dislike for Bill Clinton. They reason that, 
even if he was acquitted in the Senate, impeachment would mark him as not even 
President Nixon was marked. Mr. McCollum said the other day that impeachment 
would satisfy those who ''believe the President should be branded and given the 
scarlet letter.'' 

The right is affirmatively opposed to what many people favor: censure instead of 
impeachment. It would rather lose on impeachment and then use the negative votes 
of moderate Republicans to try to purge them in primaries. 

Republican moderates are under heavy pressure from the right. When 
Representative Billy Tauzin of Louisiana let it be known that he might consider 
censure rather than impeachment, the far-right magazine Human Events denounced 
him as ''pro-perjury.'' His office got thousands of calls. 

The moderates are also said to have been put off by what Mr. DeLay called 
''lawyerese'' in Mr. Clinton's reply to 81 questions from the Judiciary Committee. 
Anyone facing a prosecutor who wants to put him in prison -- as Kenneth Starr 
plainly does the President -- will be advised by his lawyer to say as little as 
possible. Even so, Mr. Clinton could no doubt have been more forthcoming. 

But what should be in the minds of the Republican moderates -- and for that 
matter conservative Democrats -- is history. Specifically, the two notorious 
impeachments in our history: of Supreme Court Justice Samuel Chase in 1804 and 
President Andrew Johnson in 1868. 

Chief Justice Rehnquist published a book in 1992 on those two impeachments and 
trials, ''Grand Inquest.'' Both, he said, were highly political. President 
Jefferson and his supporters went for Justice Chase because they did not like 
his judgments. President Johnson was attacked by the Radical Republicans of his 
day because he wanted to temper harsh policies toward the South after the Civil 
War. 

If either had been convicted, Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote, ''a long shadow 
would have been cast'' over the independence of the courts and the Presidency. 
But enough Jeffersonians in the Senate voted to acquit Justice Chase. And 
President Johnson was acquitted by a single vote -- that of a Republican Senator 
from Kansas, Edmund G. Ross. 

Senator Ross was ostracized and impoverished because of his vote. But John F. 
Kennedy listed him in ''Profiles in Courage,'' saying his ''heroic'' act ''may well 
have preserved . . . constitutional government in the United States.'' 

The accusers of Bill Clinton have abandoned all the potentially serious charges: 
Whitewater, campaign finance, Filegate. What remains, however ingeniously 
framed, is lying about sex. To impeach him for that would trivialize a grave 
constitutional process and cast a lingering shadow on the Presidency.
