HEADLINE:  Reno Rejects Outside Inquiry On Clinton for Campaign Ads

WASHINGTON, Dec. 7 -  
Attorney General Janet Reno announced today that she had no reasonable grounds 
to seek the appointment of an independent counsel to investigate President 
Clinton's role in a multimillion-dollar Democratic advertising campaign for the 
1996 election. Her decision swept away a lingering campaign finance issue that 
had haunted the White House for months. 

On the final day of a 90-day review period provided under the independent 
counsel law, Ms. Reno concluded that no further criminal investigation of Mr. 
Clinton was warranted because there was ''clear and convincing evidence that the 
President and Vice President lacked the criminal intent to violate the law.'' 

The conclusion was based on Ms. Reno's finding that their decisions had been 
guided by legal advice that the advertisements were lawful. Excerpts from her 
court filing, page A24. 

Ms. Reno did not reach any judgment on the legality of the advertisements' 
financing itself. But she said the laws that regulated them were ambiguous, 
noting that members of the Federal Election Commission just last week described 
the standards as ''fuzzy'' and ''hardly clear.'' The commission is expected to 
consider at meetings later this week whether 1996 advertising campaigns of both 
the Democratic and Republican Parties amounted to civil violations of election 
law. 

The $46 million television campaign at issue in Ms. Reno's decision today was 
financed by the Democratic National Committee and, under the law, was permitted 
to convey only broad party messages. 

Instead, Federal election auditors have found, it communicated specific 
electioneering messages that directly benefited the Clinton-Gore re-election 
candidacy. It was as a result of that finding, three months ago, that Ms. Reno 
set out to determine whether an independent prosecutor should investigate Mr. 
Clinton or his aides on the ground that they might have knowingly evaded the law 
in directing the advertising drive. 

During the course of the subsequent inquiry, in which Mr. Clinton himself was 
interviewed by the Justice Department, the President's lawyers argued that his 
reliance on legal advice insulated him from a charge of wrongdoing, since, they 
said, it showed that he had had no intention of violating the law. Today, in her 
filing with the special Federal court that oversees independent-counsel matters, 
Ms. Reno agreed. 

The Attorney General acknowledged in that filing that Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore 
had been intimately involved in the advertising campaign, raising money, 
formulating the advertising strategy, and reviewing and commenting on specific 
campaign messages. 

But she found that their lawyers had also been deeply involved, so much so that 
''media consultants periodically complained about the constraints the lawyers 
were placing on them.'' 

At the White House, officials expressed their pleasure with the Attorney 
General's judgment. 

''As we've said all along, the President and the Clinton-Gore campaign complied 
with the spirit and letter of the law,'' said Joe Lockhart, the White House press 
secretary. ''We are gratified by the decision.'' 

At the same time, Ms. Reno disappointed Republicans, who had hoped that the 
''issue ad'' investigation might finally force her to seek an independent 
prosecutor into campaign finance, an appointment they had sought for nearly two 
years through the course of inquiries into several aspects of fund-raising 
irregularities. 

Of all those inquiries, this one was surely among the most significant, because 
an independent counsel would have focused directly on Mr. Clinton's activities 
and cut to the core of the Democrats' fund-raising operations for the 1996 
election. 

As they had before, Republicans complained today that Ms. Reno had 
compartmentalized the campaign finance investigations, effectively diluting any 
accusations. ''Janet Reno has sliced this broad scandal into narrower issues so 
that common threads, patterns and facts are not considered when weighing each 
decision whether to seek an independent counsel,'' said Senator Orrin G. Hatch of 
Utah, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. 

Senator Fred Thompson of Tennessee, chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs 
Committee, which held extensive campaign finance hearings last year, found the 
outcome predictable. 

''Everyone knew this was coming, and it's another banner day for the lawyers,'' 
Mr. Thompson said. ''Lawyers advised the President that what he was doing was 
O.K. Lawyers at the Justice Department advised Reno that the independent counsel 
law didn't apply. She relied on every lawyer around except the ones responsible 
for the investigation -- F.B.I. Director Louis J. Freeh and the head of the 
Justice Department's campaign finance task force, Charles La Bella.'' 

Mr. Thompson was referring to confidential memorandums by Mr. Freeh and Mr. La 
Bella urging Ms. Reno to seek appointment of an independent prosecutor on 
campaign finance. 

Her move today followed by two weeks a decision by Ms. Reno in which she cleared 
away what might have been a serious obstacle on Vice President Al Gore's path to 
the Presidency. In that decision, Ms. Reno found on Nov. 24 that there was 
insufficient evidence for an outside prosecutor to look at whether Mr. Gore had 
lied to Justice Department investigators about his 1996 White House fund-raising 
efforts. 

Taken together, these two decisions, plus one yet to come in a case involving 
Harold M. Ickes, former deputy White House chief of staff, amounted to what 
campaign finance lawyers said was probably the last chance for Ms. Reno to allow 
an outside prosecutor to examine the actions of senior White House officials in 
financing Mr. Clinton's re-election.
