MEXICO CITY, Nov. 30 -  
The newest danger awaiting motorists on the mean streets of Mexico City comes 
from revolver-waving bodyguards in speeding unmarked cars, who swerve from lane 
to lane to make sure no one gets close to the chauffeur-driven limousines they 
follow. 

A bump from one such escort car almost sent Humberto Cantu and his humble Ford 
sedan careering into a tree. Mr. Cantu, a radio disk jockey on his way to work, 
caught up to the bodyguards at the next stoplight to berate them. One of them 
pointed a pistol at his nose. 

''Relax, buddy,'' the man told Mr. Cantu. ''Can't you see that we're working?'' 

In the last two years, violent crime in the capital and other major Mexican 
cities has surged out of control while police forces, disabled by decades of 
corruption, have all but collapsed. So rare is it for the capital's regular 
police officers to stop a crime that they often make newspaper headlines when 
they do. 

As a result, frightened citizens who need help to defend their loved ones or 
their property have turned to private security guards, legions of them. 

The huge growth of private security is a new complication for Mexico's efforts 
-- so far in vain -- to subdue a tidal wave of crime, especially robbery and 
kidnapping. Most guards are armed but few are trained or licensed, and the 
authorities acknowledge they have little control over them. Abuses against 
unsuspecting passers-by grow more frequent every day, as do violent crimes by 
crooks posing as private policemen. 

''We have allowed a bunch of fly-by-night security companies to arm a huge number 
of people, basically an entire army,'' said Victor Manuel Soto Camacho, a Mexico 
City councilman from the opposition Party of the Democratic Revolution who is an 
expert on local crime. ''In many cases our citizens, instead of getting security, 
are getting more danger.'' 

In affluent neighborhoods, the bodyguards seem to rule the streets. They 
strong-arm pedestrians, charge through red lights and brandish weapons, all in 
the name of defending ''the boss,'' whoever that may be. 

''Who has not been insulted or threatened?'' Arnoldo Kraus, a newspaper columnist, 
wrote. ''All because we deign to travel on the same street as them. The 
aggression of those wardens of 25-year-old rich kids and their Mercedeses and 
BMW's is downright degrading.'' 

Nationwide, 200,000 Mexicans are employed as guards by some 3,000 private 
companies, industry figures show. Only 275 companies are properly registered 
with the Government. As many as 90,000 private guards work in Mexico City, 
11,000 more than the number of uniformed policemen. 

The tradition of private bodyguards is not new in Mexico, which even contributed 
its own word for them to the Spanish lexicon: ''guaruras,'' a term handed down 
from the Aztecs. 

Its original meaning is not known, but the current one, according to a standard 
dictionary of Mexican phraseology, is unambiguous: ''A strong and overbearing 
individual ready to draw his weapon, who is in charge of protecting another 
person.'' 

In past decades only the most powerful politicians and conspicuous tycoons had 
their own security guards. Now practically any office building, middle-class 
neighborhood or prominent business executive needs protection. 

Even Homero Aridjis, a leading intellectual who is the president of the writers' 
group International PEN, travels with burly men at his back since he received 
telephone death threats late last year. 

''We live in a culture of fear,'' Mr. Aridjis said. ''And we don't really know if 
the men watching out for us are good or bad, honest or criminal.'' 

The guaruras' style is unmistakable. They gather in forbidding clusters outside 
business conferences and power-elite restaurants during Mexico City's 
late-afternoon lunch hour. Their vehicles of choice are either a Chrysler Spirit 
or a Dodge Stratus, with hubcaps removed and four doors for quick exit. A heavy 
black steel grate, known as a burro-bouncer, shields the front fender so the 
driver can ram other cars without denting his own. 

Subtlety is not a feature. The guaruras all seem to wear shiny suits, black ties 
and dark glasses. Their belts hang heavy with beepers and cellular phones and 
their jackets bulge with barely concealed handguns. They ride four to a car, 
each one peering warily out his window. And Mr. Cantu, the disk jockey, is an 
example of what happens to the unwary driver who wanders in between them and 
their clients. 

''A professional bodyguard should be discreet,'' said Ramon Requeijo Abad, 
president of the Mexican branch of Nutronica, an international security company 
that is one of the few to fully screen and train its guards. ''But in this 
country they love to make a show of their arrogance. If there is a fight, they 
jump in and make it worse.'' 

Most guards are not personal escorts but lowly watchmen, standing duty in stores 
and building lobbies. Often they make less than $50 a week, so the incentive is 
for them to commit crimes rather than prevent them. Over the last year the city 
police have seen a rash of break-ins that appear to be inside jobs by doormen 
and night watchmen. 

Police Chief Alejandro Gertz Manero opened a campaign in Mexico City recently to 
impose tight supervision on the security industry. He wants all guards to be 
registered and to pass drug, psychological and weapons-handling tests as well as 
undergo criminal-background checks. 

Mr. Gertz started the crackdown after he noticed two police patrol cars 
escorting a private vehicle, a practice that is prohibited. 

After stopping the patrol cars himself, he quickly discovered that they were 
private vehicles illegally painted with the colors of the police force. 

''Everyone has the right to seek protection for himself,'' Mr. Gertz said. ''No one 
has to the right to offend or humiliate others.''
