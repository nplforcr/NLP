Rebel cease-fire is a farce, Sudan army says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ A rebel decision to unilaterally extend a
cease-fire by three months is only a pretext to cover troop
movements and training, Sudan's army spokesman was quoted as saying
Saturday.
``We in the armed forces believe the cease-fire will benefit the
rebellion movement'' because the rebels will use the time to
prepare for future combats, Lt. Gen. Abdul-Rahman Sirul-Khatim said
in an interview with the daily Al-Rai Al-Akher.
The rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army said Thursday that it
will extend by another three months the current three-month
cease-fire when it end Wednesday to allow relief food to reach
civilians in war provinces like Bahr el-Ghazal in the south.
Khartoum has not officially responded to the announcement, and
Sirul-Khatim's comments are the first from a government official on
the cease-fire.
Sirul-Khatim, however, indicated that the ``government has its
position on this (cease-fire).''
Sudan has been embroiled in a civil war for 15 years with
Christian and animist rebels fighting for more autonomy from the
Muslim, Arab north.
About 1.5 million people have died in the war and related
famines caused by food and medical supplies being held up by the
fighting.
