CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa _ This is crunch time in the 1998 campaign
season, and no Democrat is likely to be hammering Republicans
around the country more extensively than Vice President Al Gore in
the two weeks remaining before the Nov. 3 elections.
With Democrats sensing improved chances and President Clinton
cutting back his travel to accommodate developments like the
Middle-East negotiations in Wye Mills, Md., Gore has become the
administration's busiest spokesman on the campaign trail, defending
Clinton's policies, criticizing the opposition and raising money.
The strategy continued Tuesday in Illinois and Iowa, where the
vice president made nine campaign appearances in five cities before
flying on to New Mexico and California for more speeches over the
next two days. Between now and the elections, aides say he could
visit as many as a dozen states _ more, if Clinton stays home.
In large measure, Gore is focusing on tightly contested House
races, or at least those in which a Democrat would have a better
chance of winning if the turnout were high. And if a Democratic
candidate for governor needs help, as Tom Vilsack does in Iowa, so
much the better.
Vilsack, a state lawmaker who is challenging Jim Lightfoot, a
Republican, to succeed Gov. Terry Branstad, a Republican who is
retiring, accompanied Gore at each of his six stops Tuesday in
Iowa.
``I don't think we're going to break any new ground on the
issues,'' an aide to Gore said. ``The focus now is turnout. We have
to bring up the level of enthusiasm, raise the level for
grass-roots intensity. We've made our arguments; we just have to
reinforce them.''
Traveling around Iowa has an added benefit for Gore because, as
the probable Democratic front-runner to succeed Clinton, he can
expand his base in the state that holds the first presidential
caucuses.
It has only been in recent weeks that Democrats have found
evidence through recent polls that the midterm elections might
produce something less than a disaster for them.
Early predictions that the impeachment inquiry against Clinton
would cause Democrats to lose scores of seats in the House have
largely given way to more optimistic expectations, perhaps a loss
of fewer than 34, the historical average for the party in the White
House in the sixth year of an administration.
Part of the reason, Gore said at a rally in Davenport for Bob
Rush, the Democrat challenging Rep. Jim Leach, an 11-term
Republican incumbent, is that Democrats perceive voters as angry
that Congress spent too much time on the Clinton sex scandal at the
expense of important legislation.
It is not a new thought as part of Gore's standard stump speech,
which stresses education, health care and preserving Social
Security. But his expanding emphasis on Republican scandal-lust is.
In recent days, Gore has been refining the core of his criticism
with a suggestion that voters should make the impeachment
proceedings an Election Day referendum, a change from several
months ago when Democrats feared the scandal would bury them in the
fall.
``We say, let's put it to a vote of the American people,'' as
Gore said in Moline, Ill., campaigning for Rep. Lane Evans, an
eight-term Democrat facing a strong challenge from Mark Baker, a
former television newsman and a Republican in his second bid for
election.
