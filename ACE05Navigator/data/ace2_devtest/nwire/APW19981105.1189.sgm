FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Former World War II slave laborers
under the Nazis said on Thursday they would fight a plan by
Germany's government and industry to set up a compensation fund,
saying the proposed settlement was an attempt to bypass their
claims.
``The survivors are ready to work toward a solution _ but they
will not be shut out and the German government cannot stop their
claims,'' the group said in a statement faxed from their lawyer's
office in the United States.
Before taking office last month, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's
government said a group comprising government and industry will
work out a plan to settle back-wage claims from World War II-era
slave laborers.
Among those participating in the group are the bosses of Allianz
insurance company, Dresdner and Deutsche banks, Volkswagen, BMW,
Siemens, Krupp, Degussa and BASF. It will be headed by Schroeder's
chief of staff, Bodo Hombach.
The plan is an attempt to ``bargain away our claims,'' survivor
Paul Frenkel said in the statement. He did not elaborate on how
that was being done, and the German government has not announced
any specifics on a payment plan.
An alternative group comprising class action claimants, slave
labor survivors, the Jewish Claims Conference, German industry and
banks and the German government should meet and agree on a
settlement, group lawyer Michael Witti said in the statement.
The survivors called on the German government to recognize their
right to settle their claims individually or on a class action
basis, pointing to the recent 1.25 billion dollar settlement
reached with Swiss banks on Holocaust victims' accounts there that
had never been settled.
New York-based lawyer Ed Fagan and Munich-based Witti will
accompany representatives of the group on a two-day trip to
Frankfurt Friday and Saturday, where they will press their claims.
Estimates on the number of slave laborers used by the Nazis run
as high as 9 million, many of the them from eastern Europe.
