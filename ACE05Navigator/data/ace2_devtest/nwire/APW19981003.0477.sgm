RIGA, Latvia (AP) _ Those who could vote Saturday on whether to
ease citizenship laws for hundreds of thousands of stateless ethnic
Russians were often confused, and those who couldn't were stony
with resentment.
A referendum held in conjunction with voting for the country's
100-seat Saeima parliament asked voters if they want to reject
liberalizing citizenship law amendments that the parliament passed
in June.
The amendments were passed after a tense spring in which Russia
threatened trade sanctions against diminutive neighbor and rained a
hot barrage of denunciations, including Moscow mayor Yuri Luzhkov's
characterizing Latvia as committing genocide.
Meanwhile, the West was unhappy with Latvia, though its
statements were more measured. The Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe urged changes and many officials predicted
that the European Union, which Latvia ardently wants to join, would
never let the country in unless it lowered the obstacles to
citizenship.
But after the amendments were passed, a referendum drive to
overturn them began, spearheaded by nationalist politicians who
claim Latvian national identity is imperiled.
After Latvia became independent of the Soviet Union in 1991,
citizenship was granted to ethnic Latvians and to anyone who had
lived there prior to the Soviet annexation in 1940.
That left out the hundreds of thousands of ethnic Russians who
poured into Latvia during Soviet rule, and to their children even
if born in Latvia. Today, about 452,000 of the country's 740,000
ethnic Russians are without citizenship.
Because they can't vote, they regarded Saturday's referendum
with angry resignation.
``I was born in Riga, I live in Riga, but I am Russian and can't
vote. I don't like it here,'' said a young woman who gave her name
only as Alex, selling cassettes in the vast market that sprawls in
and around five old dirigible hangars on the outskirts of downtown.
But many people who could vote were annoyed because the
referendum question was phrased confusingly: a ``yes'' vote meaning
``no'' to the changes.
``Frankly, I didn't understand the issue or the ballot,'' said
79-yar-old Dzetins Alois, who voted in the parliamentary election
but not in the referendum.
He wasn't alone. The Central Elections Commission said that as
of 4 p.m. (1300 GMT), about 55 percent of the 1.3 million people
eligible to vote had cast ballots in the election, but about 52
percent in the referendum.
Some voting irregularities were reported, including President
Guntis Ulmanis giving a television interview inside a polling
station, and a polling place in the city of Jurmala failing to
stamp about 200 ballots properly.
The referendum apparently slowed down voting procedures and
elections commission head Arnis Cimdars said he was concerned the
pace might be too slow to have voting completed on time.
Of the 21 parties and alliances seeking seats in the Saeima
(pronounced SIGH-mah), the right-wing Fatherland and Freedom party
of Prime Minister Guntars Krasts was the only major party
campaigning to turn down the changes.
But even that party's support on the issue was not universal.
Harijs Vasilievs said he voted for Fatherland and Freedom party
because he liked their economic polices, though he voted against
the referendum
``I think Russian children born in Latvia should be given
citizenship,'' the 61-year-old Vasilievs said. ``They are not to
blame for the situation they have found themselves in.''
On issues other than citizenship, like the need to seek EU and
NATO membership, there is wide agreement among the parties. There
is also broad support for the free-market reforms that have raised
Latvia up from the stagnant Soviet era.
Voter support for one party or another appeared to depend as
much on the personality of leaders as on specific issues.
The party that has been No. 1 in most pre-election polls with
around 20 percent support is the center-right Peoples Party, a new
party founded by wealthy businessman and a former prime minister,
Andris Skele.
Skele has said Latvia relies too much on transit trade to and
from Russia, and said policies should also focus on producing goods
in Latvia for export.
