atlanta , oct. 29 - this has been the best year of vijay singh 's career , and today he played one of the best rounds of his life . shooting a brilliant seven-under-par 63 on a challenging east lake golf club course where only nine players broke par , singh soared to a three-stroke lead over billy mayfair after the first round of the tour championship . it was a machine-like display of ball-striking by singh , this year 's p.g.a. champion , who missed only one fairway and putted with precision on lightning-fast greens that invited mistakes . singh 's round was the best competitive round in east lake 's history , and it also matched the lowest round in tour championship history , equaled by wayne levi in 1989 and jim gallagher jr. in 1993 . tommy barnes holds the course record (62) at east lake , but the legendary bobby jones , who learned to play golf at east lake , never shot better than a 63 on his home course . regardless of what club singh held in his hands today , he felt confident of hitting a good shot . singh made it look easy . but it was n't . '' unbelievable , '' said singh , whose round included eight birdies and one bogey as he avoided the treacherous bermuda rough . '' i hit the ball probably the best i did all year . i drove the ball really long and straight . the longest iron i hit today was a 6-iron . '' today was an exceptional round for anybody to shoot 63 around here . i think the longest putt i had was 18 feet . it 's one of the best rounds i 've ever had from tee to green . '' nobody could keep pace with singh today , but with three rounds remaining on a course this difficult , most players in the elite 30-man field remained within striking distance . mayfair 's 66 left him alone in second place , while tom lehman and jim furyk (67) were tied for third place . meanwhile , the competition for the money title and pga tour player of the year honors could get interesting before the weekend ends . david duval can clinch the money title simply by finishing alone in 24th place or better . but duval struggled to a 75 today , leaving him tied for 28th place with tiger woods . if duval finishes lower than 24th , and if furyk wins the tournament , furyk can snatch the money title from duval . and duval is battling mark o'meara for player of the year honors , but o'meara did not have a sparkling round today either , shooting a one-over-par 71 . the scores of duval and woods , neither of whom had a birdie , showed how difficult east lake is , but singh was almost too good to notice . he shot a five-under-par 30 on the front nine , using his accuracy to set up makeable birdie putts . at no. 1 , singh hit a 9-iron approach shot to within six feet of the cup . at no. 3 , he hit a sand wedge to within a foot . at no. 5 , he hit another 9-iron to eight feet . at no. 8 , he hit a pitching wedge to a foot . singh made all of those ensuing short putts for birdie , then at no. 9 , he made an 18-foot birdie putt , just in case anyone felt that he could not make a long one . singh 's momentum continued on the back nine . he birdied no. 11 , hitting a 7-iron approach shot to six feet , then making the putt . on no. 13 , his birdie was set up by a sand wedge approach shot that stopped a foot from the hole . then singh reached eight under par when he birdied the par-5 no. 15 , reaching the green in two shots , then two-putting from 25 feet . the only blemish on singh 's card came at the par-3 no. 18 , when he bogeyed by three-putting from 40 feet . but it did not spoil his day , or his year . despite all the talk about duval and o'meara , singh is third on the money list , and he has won two tournaments -lrb- the p.g.a. championship and sprint international -rrb- . if singh were to take home the $ 720,000 first-place check , he would finish no. 2 on the money list , and he would have more victories on tour this year than anyone except duval -lrb- four -rrb- . singh entered this week somewhat overshadowed , but he was not after today . most of singh 's gallery came to see woods , singh 's playing partner . but while people may have arrived talking about woods , they left talking about singh . '' my whole game is getting better , '' said singh , a 35-year-old native of fiji , who lives in ponte vedra beach , fla. '' but i was never expecting to shoot anything like that . i just said , ` make sure you play solid , shoot a good number , do n't shoot yourself out . ' it turned out really good for me . ''
