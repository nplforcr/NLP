washington , oct. 4 - the clinton administration this week enters the final phase of what has been a highly contentious effort by the government to hand administration of the internet over to an international nonprofit corporation . a group led by jon postel , a founder of the internet , presented the government on friday with its proposal for creating a california-based entity called the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers . '' this organization will be unique in the world -- a nongovernmental organization with significant responsibilities for administering what is becoming an important global resource , '' mr. postel wrote . the larger significance of the proposal is that it lays out the final privatization of the internet by the federal government , which financed decades of internet development as a communication tool for military and academic researchers . the more immediate issue is forming an equitable plan for creating and distributing '' top-level domain names , '' the identifiers like . com and . org that identify what type of resource an internet address is . the . com top-level domain , for example , signifies a commercial address . until now , domain names have been administered by the united states government -- at first directly and in more recent years under a government contract granting a registration monopoly to network solutions , a corporation based in herndon , va. . a number of private companies have demanded that they be allowed to compete with network solutions in the lucrative business of registering domain names , while europeans and asian have complained that their interests are underrepresented in the development and administration of domain names . the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers , which is newly incorporated , nominated nine interim board members to help finish writing bylaws and create a permanent 19-member board responsible for introducing competition and a recognition of international interests to the domain registration system . under the proposal , the corporation would also make decisions on how and when to add new top-level domains . but the long-awaited revamping plan by mr. postel 's group still has a number of critics , and the clinton administration has not yet ironed out the details for a smooth transition of crucial property and customer records from network solutions to the new corporation . ira magaziner , the adviser to president clinton who has been overseeing the transition to private governance of the internet , had hoped to have a plan in place by the time the government 's contract with network solutions expired on oct. 1 . but a last-minute breakdown in negotiations prompted the commerce department to extend the old contract for one week . it is now set to expire on wednesday . another extension is likely , since the government will take 10 days of public comments on the plan and two proposed variations before it moves forward . many critics say the postel plan was hammered out behind closed doors , despite the administration 's call for a process that strove for consensus among the international groups that have an interest in how the network is governed . one contention about the postel plan concerns whether the new agreement would unfairly strip network solutions of the lucrative business it has built as the monopoly registrar of top-level domains . company spokesmen declined comment beyond saying negotiations with the government were continuing . a larger issue about the plan , though , is whether there would be proper fiscal controls and long-term checks on the powers of the proposed new board , whose members would be largely appointed by the professional , advocacy and commercial organizations that finance the corporation . '' the substantive problem with it is that it is completely obtuse to questions of separation of powers and limits and accountability , '' said lawrence lessig , a harvard law school professor who has been critical of what he sees as a secretive process for drafting the proposal . '' it 's a perfect corporation if you trusted the board members , '' mr. lessig said , '' just like any communist government is perfect if you trust the communist government . '' an international coalition of associations representing a range of internet interests has filed its own bylaw proposals , which would make the corporation a membership-based organization rather than one whose board members are largely selected by the organizations that finance it . in another objection , j. william semich , president and chief financial officer of . nu domain , a registrar of second-level domain names , said that the proposed bylaws lacked the proper budget reviews and spending limits . in his letter to william daley , the secretary of commerce , mr. postel acknowledged the continuing opposition to his plan . he said that while the organization had been formally incorporated , it had not yet elected a board or adopted bylaws and did not plan to do so until the completion of a commerce department review of the proposal . '' there are many challenges left for the days and years to come , but the consensus that developed around these documents provides considerable promise that those challenges can also be overcome , '' he wrote . the proposed interim board includes representatives of telecommunications , internet and academic interests from the united states , japan , australia and europe .
