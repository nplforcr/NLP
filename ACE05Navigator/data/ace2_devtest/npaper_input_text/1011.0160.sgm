xiamen , china , oct. 10 - from the bluffs along the edge of this booming chinese city , you can easily peer into taiwan 's western frontier , a small island only half a mile away . from the early 1950 's to 1979 , artillery here ritually pounded the nearby islands of jinmen , known in the west as quemoy , and other locations . on these same bluffs today stand giant red characters that repeat , for the benefit of nearby islanders who might gaze west with binoculars , china 's proposal for luring '' renegade '' taiwan back into the fold : '' one country , two systems to reunify china . '' across the water taiwan , in response , has put up a huge white billboard calling for reunification according to the '' three people 's principles '' propounded early this century by the founder of the republic of china , sun yat-sen : nationalism , democracy and better livelihood . the dueling signs , erected last year , express the continuing test of wills between china and taiwan -- a struggle that will enter a new phase on wednesday with the first high-level contact in five years between the two sides . although taiwan and china these days exchange symbolic gestures , even smiles , rather than artillery shots , the visit of a senior taiwan official to shanghai and beijing is so sensitive that the two sides have not publicly agreed on what they will discuss . wary officials on taiwan insist on calling this '' a visit , not talks . '' they may agree on little more than to talk again in the future . but because the stakes are so high , people on both sides of the taiwan strait , and in washington , will be scrutinizing every inflection . china sees recovering sovereignty over taiwan as the unfinished business of the civil war that brought communist victory on the mainland in 1949 . china ceaselessly calls the recovery of taiwan its overriding foreign policy goal . taiwan , which has created prosperity and democracy , no longer claims , as it once did , to house the true government of all china . more and more , its 22 million people say they feel an independent identity . taiwan 's leaders , mindful of the glowering colossus nearby , still profess to want reunification -- some day far in the future , when china , too , is prosperous and democratic . for now they insist that china and the world must recognize taiwan as a separate entity . in a typical speech on saturday , the president of taiwan , lee teng-hui , called for a '' gradualist approach '' toward unity . '' we are looking forward to constructive dialogue between the two sides of the taiwan strait based on the reality of divided rule , '' he said , promising continued efforts to break free of the diplomatic strangulation pursued by beijing . visiting china from oct. 14 to 19 will be koo chen-fu , head of the semiofficial straits exchange foundation . he is to meet with his chinese counterpart , wang daohan , head of china 's association for relations across the taiwan strait . in what is seen as a good-will gesture by beijing , mr. koo is also to meet the chinese president , jiang zemin , on oct. 18 . mr. koo and mr. wang held their first , and only , official talks in singapore in 1993 . their next scheduled meeting , in 1995 , was canceled by china when it was angered by president lee 's visit to a class reunion at cornell university , seen as a perfidious effort to bolster taiwan 's independent status . the next year , relations became more tense when china conducted missile tests near taiwan during the island 's presidential election and the united states sent aircraft carriers into the region . since then the united states , worried about being dragged into a conflict , has encouraged both sides to resume talks . despite their diverging goals , both sides may feel that their interests are served by meeting , said a western diplomat in beijing . '' for taiwan , if china is talking it 's not attacking , and for china , if taiwan is talking then it 's not declaring independence , '' the diplomat said . china has called for immediate discussions of the political future , offering a deal looser than hong kong 's in which taiwan could keep its democracy and even its army but come under chinese sovereignty . taiwan wants to fend off political negotiations , limiting talks for now to practical issues like fishing and immigration disputes . complicating the matter , china and taiwan are increasingly intertwined economically and socially , a process china encourages and taiwan is struggling to limit . the ties are apparent here in xiamen , one of china 's thriving '' special economic zones '' that is host to many taiwan factories , real estate developments and tourists . in the last few days , among hundreds of visiting '' compatriots , '' as they are always called here , were 24 members of a taipei golf club who came to play xiamen 's three golf courses and sightsee . also visiting , at the invitation of the elders ' society of xiamen , were 21 men and women from a taiwan senior citizens ' group , who are performing folk songs and dances in several cities . more than a million business executives and tourists from taiwan visit china each year , and some 50,000 live here , the western diplomat said . in contrast , taiwan strictly limits visitors from the mainland . taiwan 's investment and trade in the mainland are large and climbing , even as its government tries to enforce its slogan of '' go slow ; be patient . '' the taiwan government has refused to allow large , showcase investments like multibillion-dollar petrochemical and power projects in fujian province that were planned by the giant formosa plastics group . many taiwan businesses are chafing at the policy , and the formosa group 's chairman , wang yung-ching , has publicly urged his government to relax it . '' we fear we will lose our opportunity '' in china , he said in a recent speech . most important , taiwan does not allow direct transportation , postal or communications links with the mainland . this slows cross-strait business by adding costs and forces travelers to spend hundreds of extra dollars looping through hong kong or macao . capt. yao ming-fu of the taiwan-owned ship uni-pioneer , in xiamen harbor this weekend to pick up cargo that will eventually go to japan or southeast asia , expressed the frustrations of shippers and businessmen . taking goods directly from here to taiwan 's main harbor takes about 12 hours , he said . but his ship can only carry chinese-made goods for reshipment onward ; none can be imported into taiwan . transporting chinese goods to taiwan itself requires a 24-hour boat trip to hong kong , some bothersome paperwork , then another 14-hour journey to taiwan , said captain yao . his parent company , the evergreen group , is one of the world 's largest shippers . taiwan officials have not been able to contain small-scale direct commerce in both directions among islands around xiamen , and people from taiwan even make one - to five-day visits across these waters , say local press reports and scholars . how long this strange dance between china and taiwan can continue is unknown . china has warned that if taiwan formally declares independence , it will mount a military attack -- a regional catastrophe . short of such a declaration , what action by taiwan might touch off a harsh response ? how long will china 's patience hold ? major agreement in the next three to five years seems unlikely , fan xihou , director of the taiwan research institute of xiamen university , said in an interview . but after that , he suggested , '' time will be against taiwan '' as china 's military and economic strength builds . taiwan , for its part , hopes that it can continue mustering enough strength at home and abroad to shape the terms of its future relationship with the would-be motherland .
