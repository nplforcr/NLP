the atlanta braves are not playing in new york this weekend , which means they are not playing in the world series for the third time in their seven-season run as a division champion and therefore will not win the world series for the sixth time in those seven seasons . although the braves , whose streak goes back to 1991 -lrb- and does not include the strike-shortened 1994 season , remain the most consistently good team of the 90 's -- the enduringly best since the 1949-64 yankees -- something has to be missing from the mix that gets them to the post-season year after year , at least something that rears its ugly head in october . conversations with officials from several other clubs elicited views that could explain the braves ' problem this way : the braves ' starting pitching , the best and deepest in the major leagues , dominates in the regular season because no team can match the starting five . in the playoffs , however , rotation depth is less critical , and other teams usually have three solid starters . with that advantage neutralized , the braves need more help from their hitters and fielders , and they do n't get it often enough . moreover , errors and other defensive lapses have undermined the braves ' ability to win . '' one thing the braves have that no one else has is depth in the starting rotation , '' said dave dombrowski , the marlins ' general manager . '' over a 162-game season , that is very difficult to beat . i do n't think you can beat them unless you match up the same way . but in a short series most clubs you 're playing are going to throw three quality starters at you . the fifth starter is not a factor . the fourth starter may or may not be a factor . '' the rest of the team , however , falls short of their pitching in championship status , another general manager said . '' they 're not that good a club if you take away their starting pitching , '' said the general manager , who spoke on the condition of anonymity . '' if you put their starting pitching on several national league clubs , those clubs would be better . their bullpen is ordinary at best . their defense is average at best . if they do n't hit home runs , they 're going to struggle because they 're not going to score . they 've done it with starting pitching and timely hitting for years . '' an executive of another club suggested that the braves spend so much money on their starting pitchers that they do n't have much left to spend on bolstering their hitting . '' maybe they have four good hitters , '' he said . '' if the other team 's pitching can neutralize those hitters , they can beat them . if you pitch well against them , you have a good chance of beating them because their offense and their bench are n't that great . if you match up with starting pitching , you can neutralize their power . '' in the league championship series , the san diego padres ' pitchers shut down most of the braves ' key hitters . andres galarraga had two hits in 21 at-bats for a .095 batting average and four runs batted in . ryan klesko had one hit in 12 tries (.083) . chipper jones batted a relatively torrid .208 but drove in a single run , matching klesko 's output . andy ashby held the braves to 1 run in 7 innings in the first game , kevin brown shut them out on 3 hits in the second and sterling hitchcock stymied them in two starts , allowing 1 run and 5 hits in 10 innings . the braves have also had critical defensive breakdowns . they hurt the braves in the league series against florida last october , and a relative flood of errors killed them against san diego this year . from the double error by andres galarraga on one play in the first game to danny bautista 's muffed catch of a fly ball in the last , the braves self-destructed in the series that sent the padres to new york this weekend . eight errors in six games is not the formula for post-season success . '' there are no perfect clubs , '' dombrowski observed . but he added , '' you tip your cap to the braves because they 're there every year . '' gerry hunsicker , houston 's general manager , has experienced the post-season the past two seasons and was not ready to find fault with the braves for their latest loss . he gave credit to the padres , who also defeated the astros in the division series . '' i think the padres were an overlooked team coming into the playoffs , '' hunsicker said . '' they were underrated . this is a team that for four and a half months was arguably the best team in the national league . suddenly , in september , they had a slide and everybody forgot about them . we got randy johnson and the hype got carried away . the impact randy would have on our team was overexaggerated . '' while everyone was expecting great things from the astros and the braves , hunsicker said , people were underrating the padres ' pitching . '' they have quality starters and the best closer in baseball , '' he said . '' in low-scoring games , if your pitching is going to keep you in the game , then it 's just a matter of who rises to the occasion . this season it happens to be jim leyritz . right now , jim leyritz is playing like superman . '' for lack of a no. 1 starter in the five years of their modern resurgence , the cleveland indians have never had a legitimate no. 1 starting pitcher . that may very well be the reason they have not won the world series and are not playing the world series in cleveland this weekend . '' it always helps to have that big no. 1 , '' john hart , the indians ' general manager , said . '' we readily admit we do n't have one of those dominant cy young marquee guys . but we usually have five or six guys who are good . maybe they 're going to pitch anywhere from 2 to 4 . we 've done it without a dominant no. 1 guy . does that keep you out of the world series ? no. . does it keep you from winning it ? i do n't know . '' in their four successive forays into post-season play , the indians have started dennis martinez , orel hershiser , charles nagy , ken hill , jack mcdowell , jaret wright , chad ogea , bartolo colon and dwight gooden . at times some of of those pitchers were considered no. 1 's , but they were past their prime with the indians . '' as we built our club , '' hart said , '' we built it as an american league team -- small ball parks , lack of pitching . we built our club early on around offense . to win and still compete economically , we thought we would sign starting pitchers that would be able to keep us in games and hope to develop front-of-the-rotation starters . along the line , we tried to sign some guys , but that did n't work out . '' the indians pursued roger clemens , john smoltz and alex fernandez as free agents and pedro martinez and randy johnson in trades . they still await the arrival of a pitcher of that caliber . the system they have built , hart said , has carried the club to four consecutive division titles and three a.l. championship series . '' it 's probably not the perfect world , but you kind of have to deal with what you have to work with , '' he said . '' there 's not a bottomless pit where you can go out and say we 're going to have a star at every position . thaw in the union the strong union feeling about players who served as replacement players in spring training of 1995 during the strike is apparently thawing . the melting of bitter feelings can be seen in the post-season shares voted by players on high-finishing teams . for the most part , based on a survey of club votes , players have treated replacement players like anyone else . the yankees , for example , voted shane spencer , the home run legend , half a full share based on the time he was with the team during the season . rick reed of the mets automatically received a full share because he was with the team all season , but jeff tam , a relief pitcher , was voted a share equal to the percentage of the season he spent with the mets . boston players voted pitcher ron mahay a one-quarter share , as did the chicago cubs with infielder jason hardtke . catcher mandy romero will get a partial share based on service time from san diego and a $ 3,000 cash award from boston , where he was traded june 21 . among players who were not replacements , randy johnson , who pitched for houston the last two months , was voted a full share , and jim leyritz will receive $ 10,000 from boston 's post-season players ' pot and about 54 percent of a share from san diego . a player automatically receives a full share if he is with a team from june 1 , but the yankees voted orlando hernandez a full share even though he missed that date by a couple of days . hideo nomo missed by four days , and the mets voted him a three-fourths share . the mets acquired tony phillips , willie blair and jorge fabregas on july 31 , but the players voted phillips a three-quarters share and the other two about one-third .
