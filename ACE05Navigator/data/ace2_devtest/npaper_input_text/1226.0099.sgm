as we enter what is popularly regarded as the last year of this century -lrb- not to mention this millennium -rrb- , it does n't hurt to draw perspective from someone who lived in the last century . florence adamson -- '' not flo , or flossie , it 's been florence all my life , '' she says with determined dignity -- was born jan. 4 , 1895 , into a world without movies , airplanes , income taxes , the world series and mother 's day . she was 50 when television emerged and 80 when the first personal computer was sold . yet all the progress during her 103 years , all the epic events , seem to amount to so much historical bric-a-brac when mrs. adamson reflects on her life , sitting in her mahogany and floral-print room in the osborn , a top-drawer home for the elderly here . nothing mattered more than the family she grew up with , on manhattan 's east 21st street , and the family she raised in two affluent westchester towns . '' it was a very sedate world , '' she said , sitting in an armchair surrounded by family photographs , a walker nearby on which her prim handbag dangled . '' it was our home life that was a big thing . my mother was a professional singer and i took piano lessons to accompany her . we had an edison gramophone . we loved music . '' i can remember going to stuyvesant park with a roller hoop and roller skates . mother took my brothers and me every good afternoon . we were outdoors . the park was not crowded . it was delightful . '' mrs. adamson , whose cheerful , under-five-foot presence is strengthened by soft blue eyes and spun-silver hair , raised three daughters who gave her grandchildren , great-grandchildren , and great-great-grandchildren in numbers she can not count . '' it 's hard to keep track , '' she jokes . '' i 'm lucky i can keep track of myself . '' the depression forced her to move to a smaller house . the two world wars caused some turbulence . but most great events had the quality of distant storms , sometimes scaring her , mostly sparing her , but nothing she could do much about . '' the world just took care of itself , and i had my family to take care of , '' she said . the person in the 20th century who most impressed her ? '' it might have been the organist in the church i belonged to , '' she said . '' he was a fine person , nicely educated , treated us well , and taught us music and nice manners . '' the organist ? what about franklin roosevelt , winston churchill , martin luther king ? '' i just let them take care of themselves , '' she says . getting such answers from a 100-year-old person reminds one of those interviews with mel brooks as the 2,000-year-old man . the greatest invention , the old man concluded , was saran wrap . the greatest writer ? it was n't shakespeare . '' with an l that looked like a t , an m that looked like an n. he had the worst penmanship i ever saw . '' the very old , particularly if they have led comfortable lives , have the luxury of forgetting that in the 20th century women got to vote and compete in the workplace , blacks gained access to schools and jobs , medicine made it possible for people like mrs. adamson to live to 100 . -lrb- her secret for health is not the 2,000-year-old man 's nectarine but a sherry now and then . -rrb- but her take on the century is that emotional connections matter more than all the hoopla historians pay attention to . nothing gave her more happiness than marriage to seth adamson and nothing devastated her as much as his death at 62 . '' he was playing golf on the sunday , '' she said . '' monday he has a heart attack . sunday he 's dead . '' '' i have an old-fashioned theory , '' she said . '' any woman that is loved very much by the right man has the world right at her fingertips . it makes for a happy home . it makes for happy children . '' mrs. adamson is no luddite . she appreciates the telephone that brings calls from her progeny , the television that brings her '' jeopardy . '' but she also seems to believe that many of our conveniences , much of our consuming need for news and entertainment , are distractions from life 's bedrock pleasures . in her life , it was civility and companionship that proved enduring . '' no matter what the year is , no matter what the season , if you have that , you 've got the whole works , '' she said .
