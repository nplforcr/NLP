watertown , conn. , nov. 4 - despite a commanding re-election victory on tuesday , gov. john g. rowland may be finding that it is lonely at the top . he trounced representative barbara b. kennelly by 28 percentage points , but failed to sweep along any of his four fellow republicans seeking statewide offices , or the republican running for united states senate , or either of the congressional candidates he had been promoting , or enough new state senators to give his party control of the chamber after two years in the minority . '' the emperor has no coattails , '' said matthew miller , the spokesman for the state democratic party 's campaign arm , the campaign for connecticut families . interestingly , '' the emperor '' makes few excuses . governor rowland , who was in an even chattier and more casual mood than usual today , said he had been warning for weeks that '' all politics is local , '' and that he could not transfer his popularity to others . he gave other major republican candidates a hand by speaking at their fund-raising receptions and starring in their television ads . but he rarely hit the campaign trail with them , which his staff said was not the most efficient way for him to help . just a dozen years ago , mr. rowland 's entire team likely would have been elected , since connecticut 's voting machines still had a party lever , which allowed voters to choose an entire slate automatically . in a ballot question in 1986 , voters narrowly decided to eliminate the lever . ironically , the drive to have it removed was led by republicans . regardless of the pain it caused him this week , mr. rowland said he still thinks it was the right decision . '' a lever is too easy , '' he said . '' we basically were saying to people , ` you 're not smart enough to pick the candidates of your choice . ' '' one statewide race remained undecided tonight , although mr. rowland said he had been told that the republican incumbent had lost . the state treasurer , paul j. silvester , was deadlocked at 49 percent with his democratic challenger , denise nappier , who was ahead by 1,670 votes in the unofficial tally by the associated press . a spokesman for the secretary of the state 's office said an official result would be released thursday , when a decision would be made about a recount . united states senator christopher j. dodd , a democrat who defeated his republican challenger , gary a. franks , by 33 percentage points , said he would leave it to others to judge whether it was his coattails that pulled in so many democrats . '' while the governor is a good campaigner and had a strong campaign , i believe our candidates for these other offices were better and stronger candidates '' than the republicans , mr. dodd said . one democratic strategist said the campaign for connecticut families made an agonizing choice that helps explain mr. rowland 's dearth of coattails . through telephone calls and mailings , the group identified many voters who planned to vote for mr. rowland , but would support democrats for the offices on the ballot . '' we faced a difficult decision : do you turn out those voters ? '' the strategistsaid . this can be done by phoning people just before the election and offering them rides to the polls . so the choice boiled down to whether to sacrifice votes for mrs. kennelly to help elect other democrats , the strategist said . in many towns where legislative races were tight , the democrats decided that because mrs. kennelly 's campaign was not competitive , they should try to turn out the democratic supporters of mr. rowland . that decision , the strategist said , helped ms. nappier . while others huddled for post-mortems , mr. rowland , 41 , celebrated his victory today by heading off for vacation at a warm but otherwise unspecified destination with his wife , patty . before he left , he made what has become his traditional post-election stop at a metal-molding plant here . scores of delighted workers crowded around , to get a glimpse of the governor , who was wearing pleated-front dockers and a forest-green , cable-knit sweater . an exit poll of 1,459 connecticut voters by voter news service showed the breadth and depth of mr. rowland 's victory . there was little gender gap : he got 64 percent of men 's votes and 61 percent of women 's . he won in nearly every category of voters except blacks , liberals and democrats -- and even 45 percent of blacks and 38 percent of democrats voted for him . voters began splitting their tickets , however , when it came to races for the state senate , where republicans needed to pick up just two seats to regain control of the chamber . democratic leaders in the state senate held a news conference today to trumpet the preservation of their 19-to-17 majority . the majority leader , senator george c. jepsen , needled the governor for his ever-more-moderate position on issues . '' we are delighted governor rowland chose in the last year to basically adopt the democratic agenda , '' senator jepsen said . the senate president pro tempore , kevin b. sullivan , added , '' i expect he would continue to work with us , continue to follow our lead . '' mr. rowland did not take the bait , but simply said he was looking forward to continuing to work with the legislature 's leaders . '' a few days from now , everybody catches their breath and the campaign fades away and we realize we 've got to do a budget , and we 've got a legislative session starting up in a couple months , '' he said . '' we put on our game gear and off we go . '' several defeated republicans said they did not blame mr. rowland for their loss . nevertheless , his lack of coattails gave democrats a rare chance to gloat in a year when the governor has dominated the political landscape . '' he was n't wearing a coat , '' said susan bysiewicz , a democrat who was elected secretary of the state . '' he was wearing a vest . ''
