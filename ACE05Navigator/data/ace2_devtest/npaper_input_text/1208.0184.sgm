some numbers rise to the level of poetry . the 35 that 's attached to the dollar sign that 's attached to the leek and potato soup at lespinasse is one of them . in the same way that the chrysler building is more than a building , the $ 35 soup , teeming with white truffles and langoustines , is more than a soup . it is a symbol , a beacon , a shiny new prototype in the grand factory of manhattan restaurant dining . with a stroke of the pen , christian delouvrier , the new chef at lespinasse , has raised haute to new heights . '' thirty-five dollars ? '' asked alan stillman , the president of the new york restaurant group , speaking , with an audible gasp , from las vegas , where he was overseeing the opening of a new smith and wollensky . '' you sure that 's for one person ? maybe it 's for six . '' it 's for one . in crude economic terms , the soup is a lagging indicator , proof positive that the long shadow cast by the stock market crash of 1987 , a calamity that took down the $ 35 plate of pasta right along with it , is well and truly over . no one has set off fireworks . the price of a roast-chicken entree has barely budged in the last decade . but clever restaurant owners have engineered their menus to give their customers every opportunity to rack up big bills , from the mineral water and aperitif that start the meal to the desserts that finish it off . and diners do not seem to be in the mood to say no. . many new yorkers say they 've seen the evidence on their restaurant checks for the last three years . '' i 'm stunned by the $ 9 bottled water , which is just sort of slipped in there at the beginning of the meal , '' said andrea schwan , a public relations consultant who represents architects and designers . '' it 's like , ` will it be still or sparkling ? ' i feel like saying , ` well , i 'd really like chateau giuliani , ' but you feel it 's part of the experience , so you just go with it . '' for some , it 's the simple salad that somehow crept up , from $ 7 to $ 10 , or the side order of garlic mashed potatoes , for $ 7.50 . for others , it 's the 12-ounce cup of hot and sour shrimp from daily soup that runs $ 7.95 -lrb- served with a wedge of bread , a piece of fruit and cookie -rrb- , or the lunch-time entree that cracks the $ 30 barrier , like the sauteed veal chops at limoncello . the examples may differ , but the song is the same : dining in the city has become very expensive . is it true ? new yorkers react to food prices the same way they react to crime . no matter what the statistics say , city residents can be counted on to tell pollsters that crime is on the rise . the diner who has just been mugged by a bottle of sparkling water priced like a designer fragrance -lrb- $ 5 for a half liter at the '' 21 '' club and $ 12 a liter at harry cipriani -rrb- is likewise inclined to believe that restaurant prices have gone through the roof . the closest thing the city has to a database on restaurant prices is the annual zagat survey , which , although comprehensive , must be read with a certain degree of caution , since the information comes from an army of unmonitored volunteers . according to the 1999 survey , which includes data through the end of june 1998 , the price of a dinner , defined as an appetizer , an entree and a drink , has risen from $ 29.38 in mid-1994 to $ 31.68 , an increase of almost 8 percent . for the 20 most expensive restaurants in the city , the price of a dinner rose from $ 63.45 to $ 68.56 , also an 8 percent increase . in the last year , prices rose 3.2 percent over all , but only 0.4 percent for the 20 most expensive restaurants . so , why do many diners feel as though they are spending a lot , lot more when they go out to eat ? probably because they are , even though their spending patterns are not likely to be reflected in the zagat survey . '' a lot of my clients are telling me that their checks are up dramatically , but i ca n't remember the last time any of them have raised prices , '' said gary levy , a partner in arthur d. levy , an accounting firm whose clients include bouley bakery , jean georges , aquavit and mesa grill . '' the smarter operators realize that if you train your staff to sell properly , you get a higher check average . '' the operators are making sure that their staff members have something to sell . while holding the line on the basic roast chicken , they have added enticing options at the higher price ranges , loaded on higher-priced specials , expanded their lists of wine by the glass , pushed the bottled water hard and in general -lrb- very much like car dealers -rrb- festooned their menus with so many tempting options that the zagat figure seems more like a theoretical construct than an achievable goal . pastry , a high-markup category , plays a much greater role than it did even a few years ago , with pastry chefs getting their own menus and star billing not only at restaurants like le cirque 2000 or gramercy tavern but also at more modest establishments like 27 standard or club raleigh at the oaks . wine by the glass , another profit center , has taken off as well , thanks in part to fancy new vacuum dioxide machines that make it possible to open an expensive bottle and preserve it for as long as a week . the once-standard $ 5 glass of pedestrian california chardonnay -lrb- these days more like $ 8 -rrb- now inhabits a thickly populated list that teems with moneymaking opportunities , especially among the lesser-known brands that can take a big markup , since customers are unlikely to know the retail price . at veruka in soho , most customers will know that $ 9 for a glass of 1995 rosemount estate is not much of a value , since a bottle sells at retail for $ 10 , but will they know how to size up the $ 18 price tag on a glass of 1993 ferrari-carano cabernet ? -lrb- it retails for about $ 23 . -rrb- at every turn diners have every opportunity to spend big . '' we 've gone the option route , '' said steve scher , an owner of union pacific . '' we have a $ 59 prix fixe menu , which we regard as good value , but the menu also presents you with options to build a meal that results in a more expensive check . '' a little foie gras here , a flight of amuse-bouche there , an excursion into the $ 110 tasting menu -- it can add up . union pacific is not alone . fixed-price fever has gripped the city 's restaurants . diners like prix fixe because they know what the check will be . restaurants like it because it commits customers to a meal that may very well be more expensive than the one they would order a la carte , especially since it commits them to eating desserts . '' within the confines of a prix fixe menu , you can hide all sorts of extravagant items , '' said drew nieporent , whose myriad group owns nobu , the tribeca grill and other high-end restaurants . '' a $ 75 menu is probably a $ 25 appetizer , a $ 35 entree and a $ 15 dessert . '' restaurant owners have been hesitant to do much more than nickel-and-dime the menu on the basic appetizers and entrees . when le cirque 2000 opened in 1997 , its owner , sirio macchioni , declared a two-year freeze on prices . fear not , the rack of lamb holds steady at $ 38 . rather than raising prices at arizona 206 , the santo family shut the place down and installed bolivar , a moderately priced south american restaurant . '' we did not feel a renovation was enough of a rationale for higher prices , '' said andy d'amico , a partner in the santo family group , which owns the restaurant . the group is currently shopping for the kind of grand premises that will enable it to position arizona 206 as a haute-southwestern restaurant with prices to match . this is the paradox . new york , flush with wall street money , has a lot of loose change jangling in its pockets . but restaurant owners who remember the last recession are reluctant to raise menu prices across the board , especially with increased competition from a rush of new high-priced restaurants . it takes a grand opening , or the arrival of an important chef , like mr. delouvrier , making a major statement , to crank prices up to a heroic level -- like the $ 22 prawn cocktail at the newly opened rage , or the $ 26 pumpkin risotto at la fourchette , another newcomer . '' when we see the prices at lespinasse , we get an overall impression that there 's fluidity in the market , but there is a certain threshold that , if you cross it , you have to justify it , '' said john harding , the vice president of marketing at restaurant associates , the group that owns cafe centro and tropica . the money is out there , in other words , but restaurants have to employ guile and stealth to get it . which still leaves one question about the $ 35 soup . '' as an italian , '' mr. macchioni said , '' i have to wonder , what are white truffles doing in a soup to begin with ? ''
